<span class="headword">Peto,  Henry</span>  (1774&#150;1830), <span class="occ">builder and contractor</span>, was born on 4 May 1774, the fourth son in a family of nine children of James Peto and his wife, Mary, in the parish of Cobham in Kent. Documentary sources variously describe Henry as a carpenter, bricklayer, and builder, but nothing is known of his training or early working life as a builder until 1806 when he was thirty-two. Over the next two decades he emerged as one of a new breed of builder&#151;the general contractor whose firm executed most branches of the work and contracted &#145;in gross&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1806 Peto submitted drawings and a tender to the City corporation to build an extension to the sessions house in the Old Bailey, a late eighteenth-century court house designed by George Dance, the younger. Peto won the contract to build the two-storey addition within two years at a total cost of &pound;5179. It was his first known commission. The building consisted of an open colonnaded area on the ground floor with &#145;Grecian Doric fluted columns of Portland stone&#146;  (CLRO, City Lands Contracts, 3), with rooms and offices above, a competent and scholarly classical design.<br>
<br>In 1809 Peto successfully tendered to build the naval hospital (St Nicholas's) at Yarmouth. The building was completed in 1811, again under a contract for the whole works. Peto's next undertaking, in partnership with John Miles and based at 31 Little Britain in the City of London, was the building of the foundations and carcass of a new London custom house in the City. The construction of the custom house was begun in 1813 to the designs of the city surveyor of the day, David Laing. Peto's partner died the following year. The project turned out to be a disaster from the moment it was finished in 1815, and became a professional scandal. When the Long Room in the central portion of the building collapsed in 1824 Sir Sidney Smirke was called in to investigate. He found a catalogue of building errors, the most serious of which was the failure by Peto to supply proper foundation piling in the crucial places. Peto was sued and found guilty of greed and cutting corners in a way &#145;inconsistent with the character of a fair and respectable tradesman&#146;  (TNA: PRO, WORK 12/100/2, fols. 69&#150;71). Laing was blamed for not having supervised the work properly. Both would fight in and out of court for their fortunes and reputations for the rest of their lives.<br>
<br>Remarkably, notwithstanding these setbacks, Peto continued in business. Cash flow was undoubtedly a problem; money bequeathed to Peto in 1818 by Samuel Barber, a plumber and presumably a business associate, was offset by another building collapse. At this time Peto was involved in the building of Park Crescent, part of Nash's urban scheme for Regent's Park begun in 1816. Speculator Charles Mayor had begun to build six houses on the south-east quadrant of a proposed circus, and following Mayor's bankruptcy in 1817, Peto was brought in to complete them. One of the six had been damaged by fire and collapsed after Peto's rebuilding in March 1818. Investigations found more evidence of shoddy workmanship. Perhaps thanks to Nash's covering for him, Peto continued to work: at Bryanston Square on the Portman estate from 1821, and at Raymond's Buildings, a block of lawyers' chambers, from 1825 (the year in which he went into partnership with his nephew Thomas Grissell). He also designed Wood's Hotel, built on the site of Furnival's Inn; and from 1827 worked on another Nash scheme at Carlton Gardens.<br>
<br>For the latter part of his life, Peto lived in Highbury Terrace overlooking Highbury Fields. His builders' yards were extensive and based in Lambeth. Peto died on 15 September 1830 having recouped some of his fee for building the custom house (later rebuilt to Smirke's designs). Unmarried and without heirs, he left most of his estate, including his business, in equal parts, to his nephew and partner <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49437/', "Thomas Grissell")</script> (son of his sister Anne and Thomas De La Garde Grissell) and another nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22042/', "Samuel Morton Peto")</script>, both of whom had been apprenticed to him. Peto had taken a great interest in the education of (Samuel) Morton Peto and donated prize money to his school, but once responsible for Samuel's training, Peto was apparently very strict and did not allow his nephew many holidays. After Henry Peto's death the young men took over their uncle's works at York Road and Edward Street in Lambeth and formed a new company, Grissell and Peto, well known as builders of the houses of parliament and of railways later in the century.<br>
