</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lawrence,  Frederick William  Pethick-</span>, Baron Pethick-Lawrence  (1871&#150;1961), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 28 December 1871 in London, the youngest in the family of two boys and three girls of Alfred Lawrence, carpenter and later owner of a building firm, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Ridge of Upper Clapton, Middlesex. His father died when he was three. Frederick Lawrence was a restless, difficult child who in his own words &#145;objected to the whole status of childhood&#146;  (Pethick-Lawrence, 15). He attended a day school in London, then at eleven boarded at Wixenford, a prep school in Wokingham, moving on in 1885 to Eton College, where he stayed until 1891. There he was bullied, bored with the classics, and &#145;remained &hellip; something of an outsider and a critic&#146;  (ibid., 22).<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>From his youngest days, however, Lawrence had been fond of figures and games, and for much of his life was keen on and skilled at tennis and billiards. Happy at last at Trinity College, Cambridge, he gained first classes in mathematics (part one, 1891) and natural sciences (part one, 1895), won several prizes, became president of the Union, played billiards for the university, and was inspired by Alfred Marshall's lectures on economics. His social conscience was roused at Cambridge by meeting Percy Alden, warden of Mansfield House university settlement in Canning Town. As he recalled, &#145;Marshall stimulated my brain to ascertain the facts. Alden forced me to face them and, if I could, to justify them&#146;  (Pethick-Lawrence, 48). Trinity College elected him a fellow (1897&#150;1903) but he decided against an academic career and left on a world tour, visiting India, Australasia, the Far East, and the United States.<br>
<br>Lawrence's Unitarian upbringing exposed him to Hindu influence, and at this time he began creating his personal amalgam of Christian and oriental religion. In his autobiographical chapter on &#145;my philosophy&#146; he described &#145;the enlargement of personality&#146; as life's main objective  (Pethick-Lawrence, 204); the individual must through open-mindedness and self-control ensure that good comes out of ill, and cultivate a sense of proportion which will transcend the many divisions between human beings. Pethick-Lawrence's ideas seem imprecise, and their flowery expression was for Hugh Dalton &#145;quite blush-making&#146;  (<span class="italic">War Diary</span>, 556). Nor are they clarified in what Pethick-Lawrence once described as &#145;my favourite book&#146;  (Pethick-Lawrence, 149): Mabel Collins's <span class="italic">Light on the Path</span> (1885), a highly abstract theosophical booklet consisting of a set of mystical and often paradoxical injunctions. Two years before he died he told Lord Layton that he was an agnostic, adding half-seriously, &#145;I am the most religious-minded agnostic I know&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5L</span>, 17 Oct 1961, 327). Yet his beliefs sufficed to bear him up through a lifetime of ideals challenged, pain endured, and career set-backs surmounted.<br>
<br>On returning to London, Lawrence went to live in Canning Town, intending to extend Charles Booth's social survey work. But university settlement business absorbed him, and he became its treasurer; he studied law, and was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1899. The death of his elder brother in 1900 made him wealthy, and in the following year he was selected Liberal Unionist candidate for North Lambeth. Meanwhile, what he recalled as &#145;love at first sight&#146;  (Pethick-Lawrence, 51) for Emmeline [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37846/', "Lawrence, Emmeline Pethick- (1867&#150;1954)")</script>]&#151;daughter of Henry Pethick, of Weston-super-Mare&#151;edged him politically leftwards. Her progressive views, together with his strong opposition to the South African War, made him abandon North Lambeth, and when the serious-minded couple married at the Town Hall, Canning Town, on 2 October 1901, disapproval from the relatively conservative Lawrence family was made apparent and hit his pocket. Lawrence, who quickly grew fond of his wife's family, prefixed his wife's name to his own. Their marriage was childless, and the Pethick-Lawrences now collaborated in trying to improve East End conditions. He gave the Dunkin lectures at Manchester College, Oxford, on economic issues, in 1900&#150;01, and in 1902 published an article on the need for town planning in the symposium <span class="italic">The Heart of the Empire</span>, edited by C. F. G. Masterman. To assist organized labour he bought <span class="italic">The Echo</span>, a radical evening halfpenny newspaper; in 1902 he became its editor when Percy Alden resigned. Its contributors included H. N. Brailsford and J. Ramsay MacDonald, but although Pethick-Lawrence increased the paper's circulation and invested a fortune in it, he could not make it pay and in 1905 closed it down. From 1905 to 1907 he edited the <span class="italic">Labour Record and Review</span>.<h2>
<a name="Womenssuffrageleader"></a>Women's suffrage leader</h2>Pethick-Lawrence welcomed the Liberal landslide at the general election of 1906, but increasingly diverged from the Liberal government when sucked into the Pankhursts' militant Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). His unobtrusive but full-time commitment to the union from 1907 to 1912 reflected his paradoxical combination of new-found feminist conviction with old-fashioned chivalry and personal devotion to Christabel Pankhurst, who christened him &#145;Godfather&#146;. She and the Pethick-Lawrences pushed aside the union's democrats, who seceded into the Women's Freedom League in 1907; thereafter the trio gave the WSPU firm and efficient direction until 1912. He provided much needed level-headed financial, organizational, and legal expertise, and published extensively for the cause. Already in 1906 he was supporting suffragettes in the law courts, guiding them in self-defence, and standing bail for more than 100 of them. In 1907 the Pethick-Lawrences founded and became joint editors of the periodical <span class="italic">Votes for Women</span>. In 1909, when his wife was in prison, he became joint treasurer, his first official post in the union. The man at the heart of the WSPU warded off sex conflict just as the rich man within the labour movement had earlier warded off class conflict.<br>
<br>In 1912, however, the Pethick-Lawrences were convicted of conspiracy to incite members of the WSPU to cause damage in the West End of London, and despite the jury's recommendation to clemency they were sentenced to nine months' imprisonment; Pethick-Lawrence and Mrs Pankhurst were ordered to pay the costs of the trial. All three went on hunger strike, but only Pethick-Lawrence had to face the full rigours of forcible feeding twice a day for several days; his wife was forcibly fed only once and Mrs Pankhurst not at all. After five weeks the Pethick-Lawrences were released. As Pethick-Lawrence refused to pay the costs he was declared bankrupt, a declaration rescinded a year later. Disagreements about militant strategy now caused the Pankhursts to expel the Pethick-Lawrences from the WSPU. The Pethick-Lawrences, concealing their private bitterness at how they had been treated, continued to edit <span class="italic">Votes for Women</span>, gathered the Votes for Women Fellowship around it, and in 1914 eventually merged it with the United Suffragists, a bridge-building body aiming to draw together suffragists of both sexes, and to unite militants with non-militants.<h2>
<a name="Labourpolitician"></a>Labour politician</h2>The First World War changed everything, but it gave Pethick-Lawrence another sphere in which to pursue conciliation&#151;this time between conflicting or potentially conflicting nations, for he opposed coercive imperialism and pressed for an early peace settlement. He told John Maynard Keynes in 1920 that his <span class="italic">Economic Consequences of the Peace</span> (1919), condemning the Versailles peace settlement, was &#145;of epoch making importance&#146;  (Pethick-Lawrence to Keynes, 23 Jan 1920, Marshall Library, Cambridge, Keynes papers EC1/2)&#151;hence Lawrence's support for &#145;appeasement&#146; in the 1930s. He became treasurer of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95108', "Union of Democratic Control")</script>, but standing in 1917 at the by-election for South Aberdeen as a &#145;peace by negotiation&#146; candidate he won only 7 per cent of the votes cast. In 1918 he became liable for conscription, but because he favoured a negotiated peace he refused to serve, and was assigned to work on the land. This made him enemies among supporters at Hastings, where he had been adopted as Labour candidate, and at the general election of 1918 he withdrew. His reflections on war finance led to his book <span class="italic">A Levy on Capital</span> (1918) on the need for such a levy, followed by his <span class="italic">Why Prices Rise and Fall</span> (1920).<br>
<br>By 1922 Pethick-Lawrence, as a seasoned author on economic policy, was of value to the Labour Party. Standing at South Islington he was disappointed to win only 30 per cent of the votes cast, coming bottom of the poll in a three-cornered contest. In 1923, however, with 45 per cent of the votes cast in another three-cornered contest at West Leicester, he defeated Winston Churchill&#151;more than preserving the Labour majority in a seat he retained until 1931. He set about mastering parliamentary procedure, grew to love the House of Commons, and took a genuine pride in its traditions. His maiden speech advocated pensions for widowed mothers, but he specialized in finance. He spoke in favour of a capital levy, and opposed the return to the gold standard in 1925. In the second Labour government he enjoyed his role as financial secretary to the Treasury, and got on well with his civil servants, usually sharing the Treasury view. In 1931, however, he strongly opposed the financial policy of the National Government, rejected Ramsay MacDonald's suggestion that he might be prepared to join it, and rapidly published his lucid and wide-ranging book <span class="italic">This Gold Crisis</span> (1931). For him, the crisis had arisen from the mistakenly punitive policy the allies had adopted towards Germany in the 1920s; there was, he said, no question of British national bankruptcy, and his remedy was to restore confidence and peg the exchange rate by announcing that the government would mobilize British-owned foreign investments, as occurred in both world wars. Nor did he shrink in the early 1920s or the late 1930s from the capital levy or wealth tax as an egalitarian device for curbing the national debt.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1931, in a straight fight with a Liberal, Pethick-Lawrence won only a third of the votes cast and was soundly defeated. This freed the Pethick-Lawrences to resume their frequent worldwide travels. In his visit to Russia in 1932 he acknowledged its totalitarian structure, but &#145;saw much to admire&#146;  (Pethick-Lawrence, 178), and like many in the Labour Party until the 1960s &#145;formed a very high opinion of the way in which planning was being carried out&#146;  (ibid., 177); nor is it surprising that the preface to an autobiography written in December 1942 should refer to &#145;the heroic Soviet Union&#146;  (ibid., 5). His concern at Fascist advance forced him in the 1930s to reject pacifism in favour of collective security through the League of Nations. As Labour candidate for Edinburgh East at the general election of 1935 he won 43 per cent of the votes cast in a three-cornered contest. He immediately attacked the Hoare&#150;Laval pact in parliament, but his main role was now to act as principal financial spokesman for Labour, and in 1937 he was proud to be appointed privy councillor. He claimed in 1959 to have been a lifelong &#145;unrepentant Keynes-ite&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5L</span>, 15 April 1959, 645). Certainly he repeatedly contested in the 1930s the analogy between individual and public finance, denying that the budget must be balanced every year. He also cited Sweden and New Zealand as exemplars for getting out of depression by expanding purchasing power, but later in the decade he regretted that the National Government chose a time of boom rather than slump for expanding the economy, and with the aim of rearmament rather than to boost national wealth. Throughout his career he saw the budget not as a narrowly fiscal measure, but as the occasion for monitoring the progress of the economy as a whole. In his later career, as the Treasury gained increasing control over the economy, his two major interests&#151;taxation and banking&#151;came together.<br>
<br>All-party government in 1940 separated the roles of Labour Party leader and leader of the opposition, a role assumed by H. B. Lees-Smith with Pethick-Lawrence as his unofficial deputy and chairman of the public accounts committee. Then, on Lees-Smith's death, Labour unanimously elected Pethick-Lawrence as his successor until departure from the cabinet soon freed Arthur Greenwood to assume the role. Pethick-Lawrence was now an experienced and much-respected member of the party, of which he became vice-chairman. He had long looked older than he really was, and evoked impatience from younger zealots like Aneurin Bevan, who once referred to him as &#145;a crusted old Tory&#146;. Such critics underestimated Pethick-Lawrence's continuing capacity for pushing nineteenth-century Liberal ideals in ever more radical directions: fruitfully combining statism with respect for the individual, applying reason and a faith in human progress to emotive issues such as penal reform and capital punishment, and keeping the free-trade flag flying amid protectionist reaction.<h2>
<a name="Elderstatesman"></a>Elder statesman</h2>Pethick-Lawrence had long believed that the British empire could rest secure only on a basis of goodwill, and with his wife built up over many years a network of Indian contacts. For some years until 1923 he had contributed a weekly letter to Mrs Besant's <span class="italic">New India</span>, and as a Labour MP in the 1920s he championed Indian self-government. His one burst of fury as parliamentary orator was on 18 April 1944 when L. S. Amery showed himself insensitive to Indian nationalist opinion. British wartime set-backs rendered Pethick-Lawrence's ideas practicable, and after he had been re-elected at Edinburgh East by an even larger majority in 1945, independence for India became government policy. He was appointed secretary of state for India, with a seat in the House of Lords. In 1946, accompanied by Stafford Cripps and A. V. Alexander, he led the cabinet mission to Delhi which aimed to demonstrate the sincerity of Britain's commitment to Indian independence. He did not enjoy the experience: unhappy at being parted from his wife, frustrated by Indian negotiators whose language was subtler than his own, oppressed at the age of seventy-four by the heat and by the failure in long-drawn-out negotiations of goodwill alone to prevail, he could not bridge the gulf between Hindu and Muslim, and at one point privately told his wife that he had &#145;nearly reached the limit of human endurance&#146;  (Brittain, 175). Still, his fairness and sincerity held the mission together and demonstrated the British government's goodwill, nor would the subsequent settlement have been possible if the mission had not first exposed the difficulties without undue rancour. Before agreeing to go as viceroy to India, however, Earl Mountbatten pressed for Pethick-Lawrence's removal, and in April 1947 Pethick-Lawrence resigned as secretary of state, though in the House of Lords he supported the government's Indian policy thereafter.<br>
<br>As an elder statesman Pethick-Lawrence was influential throughout the 1950s in the House of Lords, a more congenial forum than the Commons for his approach to politics, and one which reciprocated his obvious affection for it. The house respected his technical expertise, his long experience, and his consistent courtesy when voicing views that were controversial there. His intellect remained alert to the end, and he was capable of long synoptic speeches on large policy issues. His contributions became if anything more numerous after his wife died in 1954, nor did their quality decline. In 1956 he deplored the Suez venture's threat to Britain's moral authority, but his debating year was by then oriented round three major economic events: his speeches at the start of the new session, in the annual debate on the economic situation, and on the <span class="roman">Finance Bill</span>&#151;all informed by much leisure reading on economics and banking. He consistently deprecated what he saw as the government's clumsy and short-term fiscal controls by comparison with the more closely targeted and longer-term physical controls that Labour favoured, and urged close collaboration between government and the TUC. He disliked the general direction of government economic policy, as well as what was in his view an increasingly self-indulgent mood within the nation as a whole.<h2>
<a name="Concludingassessment"></a>Concluding assessment</h2>Behind all this activity was a powerful secretarial machine, driven by a punctilious and demanding master. With the day's engagements carefully listed for him, the appropriate documents attached, Pethick-Lawrence began the day by going through the agony column in the newspapers, sending condolences punctiliously. Not a moment was wasted, filing and the keeping of accounts were meticulous, newspaper clippings were systematically marked up for his attention, internal memoranda were frequently exchanged, unexpected interruptions (especially from the telephone) were discouraged and could well evoke rudeness. None the less, Pethick-Lawrence won loyalty from staff through his classless outlook; he publicly expressed pride in his secretaries, who worked as a team, and the Pethick-Lawrences drew them into their private life. His mind combined opposites: on the one hand rationalistic and in many respects radical, he was at the same time highly sentimental (especially in religion and personal relations) and also traditionalist&#151;proud of British institutions, eager to keep up with old friends, and an enthusiast for commemorating anniversaries. His mathematical mind might have led him to take black and white views in politics, and yet he was a lifelong enthusiast for compromise and for the British institutions which encouraged it.<br>
<br>Attractive to intimates was Pethick-Lawrence's almost childlike personality. Carefully graduated lists of charities supported and Christmas cards sent and received were prepared, and he took a childlike pleasure in opening presents and anticipating birthdays&#151;hence his close rapport with children. Spartan in personal comforts, hating waste of food or time, walking and exercising regularly to keep fit, he was a fanatic for routine and punctuality. Visiting Kew Gardens annually to look at the magnolias, holidaying from year to year with the same friends, stringent about the unchanging timing and content of meals, he took some pleasure in shopping, cooking, and jam-making at weekends. The contrast with his wife's habits could hardly have been greater, and she too was caught up in his bureaucratic routine, with notes regularly shuttling between them about day-to-day matters as well as formal letters on special occasions. Somehow this famous Fred and Emmeline partnership survived for more than half a century. Fred needed company, and Emmeline when ill in later life made it clear that she expected him to remarry. Some friends were surprised that after she died on 11 March 1954 he sought a replacement. On 14 February 1957 he married Helen Millar, widow of Duncan McCombie and daughter of Sir John George Craggs, chartered accountant. She was not the first to be approached, but they had been friends since the time when Helen had herself been a militant suffragette, and the inevitable difficulties in mutual adjustment were somehow surmounted. Pethick-Lawrence died in the Manor House Hospital, London, on 10 September 1961, whereupon the barony became extinct.<br>
<br>In 1943 Pethick-Lawrence published his autobiography, <span class="italic">Fate has been Kind</span>, dedicated to &#145;my wife by whose constant inspiration my life has been enriched&#146;. It was revealing and reflective on his childhood, and provided a description of the suffragette movement more vivid and personal than appears in his wife's autobiography. But his view of Pankhurstian tactics up to 1912 remained uncritical, and he did not adequately justify the contradiction between, on the one hand, the militancy and authoritarian control which he had endorsed in the WSPU, and on the other the humanitarian and democratic ideals which so patently inspired the rest of his career. Nor was the detailed case for militancy that he presented to G. M. Trevelyan in 1949 at all convincing  (see Brittain, appx 1, 215&#150;18). His account of the inter-war years contained penetrating insights, but in discussing the 1930s it degenerated into a mere narrative; it was written too close to the events under discussion for the Labour Party and his role within it to receive the close analytical attention they deserved. Vera Brittain's <span class="italic">Pethick-Lawrence: a Portrait</span> (1963) took the story to the end of his life, drew on unpublished material, and furnished useful context, but was in important respects less penetrating than the autobiography, giving &#145;causes&#146; too much attention by comparison with his role in parliament and party. Although feminism retained his support to the end, for example, far more important in his career was his role as a leading Labour spokesman on economic matters. Full justice to him will probably never be done because his personal papers, once so ample and so efficiently organized, were mostly lost through wartime salvage and through deliberate destruction at the end of his career.<br>
<br>Pethick-Lawrence had every facility for rising to the top in politics: a fine brain, wealth, industriousness, and a bevy of able secretaries and helpers. Vera Brittain explained his failure to reach the peak by noting that he was &#145;disinclined to be pushful&#146;  (Brittain, 75), but this will not suffice. Pethick-Lawrence's somewhat quietist personal philosophy may have held him back, but it is his personality that provides the key. His speeches read well in <span class="italic">Hansard</span>, and he was as capable of the broad-sweep survey as of well-informed detailed contributions on technical issues. The latter were often economic, but his policy range was wide. He took great trouble in preparing his speeches, circulated them widely, and expressed himself lucidly. Yet he lacked the essential ingredient: rapport with his audience. Nicknamed in the press gallery Pathetic Lawrence, he had &#145;no charm, no imaginative background&#146;  (Johnston, 200), and no amount of professional guidance could remedy the defect. &#145;Very sound&#146;, said Attlee, &#145;but never really came over in the House of Commons&#146;  (<span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>, 27 June 1963, 4). Pethick-Lawrence was a clubbable parliamentarian, with a ready fund of anecdote, but he developed no close trade-union or local-government links. Nor was he ever prominent at the party conference; besides, so coldly rational and humourless a speaker could never have won the Labour Party's heart, and he lacked the prestige of working-class status. He was unlucky, too, in his timing&#151;rarely within the control of politicians but often integral to their success&#151;for he had arrived late on the parliamentary scene, and always looked his age. When he and other potential leaders were out of parliament from 1931 to 1935, Attlee was getting entrenched. Add to this Pethick-Lawrence's personal foibles, which to many made him seem eccentric, even a crank: &#145;funny old Pethick&#146; is Dalton's phrase  (<span class="italic">War Diary</span>, 556). Yet none of this should detract from his career's considerable significance. Few politicians more conventionally successful were as far-sighted as he on international, social class, and feminist issues&#151;few as resolutely decent in their values or as selfless in their personal and political integrity.<br>
