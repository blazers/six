<span class="headword">O'Gorman,  Thomas</span>, Chevalier O'Gorman in the French nobility  (1732&#150;1809), <span class="occ">army officer in the French service and antiquary</span>, was born on 16 September 1732 at Castletown, co. Clare, Ireland, the son of Matthew O'Gorman or MacGorman (1705&#150;1740) and Margaret O'Loughlin, daughter of Donogh O'Loughlin of Castletown and his wife, Coelia. The family, although dispossessed of its property, belonged to the Irish Catholic gentry and was sufficiently well connected for Charles O'Brien, styled ninth earl of Thomond, commander of one of the Hiberno-French regiments, to assist O'Gorman's entry about 1750 to the Irish College in Paris, where he attended the university medical school and in due course qualified as a physician. He was commissioned into the army. Little is known of his military career, but he served in the Franco-Irish regiment of Rothe, later Walsh. He achieved the rank of captain and was made a chevalier of the military order of St Louis.<br>
<br>In appearance O'Gorman was strikingly handsome and immensely tall, exceeding 6 feet 5 inches in height. In 1757 he married Marguerite Fran&ccedil;oise Victoire D'&Eacute;on de Beaumont (1724&#150;1788), daughter of the deceased Louis D'&Eacute;on de Beaumont (<i>d</i>. 1749) of Tonnerre, a member of the lesser Burgundian nobility who had held several public offices, and his wife, Fran&ccedil;oise de Charenton. O'Gorman and his wife had three sons, all of whom served in the French army or navy. His brother-in-law was the Chevalier D'&Eacute;on de Beaumont (1728&#150;1810), the celebrated transvestite French diplomat. In 1763 D'&Eacute;on reacted sharply to an attempt by O'Gorman to interfere in his affairs and spurned his advice. However, in 1776, in London, O'Gorman offered to fight a duel on D'&Eacute;on's behalf. D'&Eacute;on, in his will, claimed that he was owed 60,000 livres by O'Gorman, which he bequeathed to O'Gorman's sons.<br>
<br>Marguerite O'Gorman's dowry was a valuable wine-growing property in Burgundy, from which O'Gorman profited sufficiently to become a figure at court and maintain a costly establishment at Paris, where he moved in the best society. He was generous to his relatives and to Irish students in Paris. He was a native speaker of Irish and developed an interest in Irish antiquarian lore, especially genealogy. His wine business brought him regularly to Ireland, where his customers included noblemen such as the earl of Inchiquin. He took advantage of these visits to collect and copy manuscripts and to transcribe tombstone inscriptions, especially in co. Clare, co. Limerick, and co. Tipperary. O'Gorman came to be regarded as a &#145;perfect master of all matters relating to Irish pedigrees&#146;, and his work won acceptance from the authorities in France and Spain, where there was a ready market for Irish genealogical material among expatriates  (Hayes, &#145;A forgotten Irish antiquary&#146;, 593&#150;4). Genealogy handsomely supplemented his income: he charged up to &pound;1000 for the preparation of a pedigree. His clients included such notable figures as Lord Clare and later his widow, and his fellow countrymen who fought in foreign service, General Count Alexander O'Reilly, General Daniel O'Connell, and others. There is no doubt that he did much useful work in this area, and the bulk of the extensive O'Gorman manuscripts in the Royal Irish Academy and the National Library of Ireland consists of genealogical correspondence, transcriptions, and notes.<br>
<br>In 1772 O'Gorman was present at a meeting of the antiquarian committee of the Dublin Society, at which he was commissioned to request a copy of the <span class="roman">Book of Lecan</span> from the superiors of the Irish College in Paris and their assistance in an enquiry into the antiquities of Ireland. The result was the establishment of a similar committee in Paris. Both bodies ceased to exist after a short time, but the contacts established may have helped lay the ground for the presentation of the <span class="roman">Book of Lecan</span> to the Royal Irish Academy in 1787. O'Gorman has been credited with securing the donation, but in fact he played no role in the final negotiations. He did, however, acquire the <span class="roman">Book of Ballymote</span> in Ireland, which in 1785 he presented to the Royal Irish Academy, of which he was made an honorary member. In 1787 he unsuccessfully sought the position of consul-general of France in Dublin.<br>
<br>An ardent royalist, O'Gorman was ruined financially by the French Revolution, which led to the confiscation of his estate in Burgundy and ended the market for his genealogical research. His wife, from whom he was estranged for many years, died in 1788, and in 1792 he married in Dublin, Mary Cuffe (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Ryan), the widow of Denny Baker Cuffe of Cuffesboro' in Queen's county. He took up permanent residence in Ireland from 1793. His sons also left France and entered the English service, two of them securing commissions in the 18th Royal Irish regiment. O'Gorman was soon heavily in debt and suffered harassment from his importunate creditors. To his embarrassment he was obliged to turn to friends and relations for support, and he wrote pitiful letters to various public figures for financial assistance to relieve his distress. To add to his troubles, the Irish government regarded him as a security risk, and he was temporarily imprisoned in the panic that followed the French expedition to Bantry Bay in 1796. Despite his misfortunes, he continued to pursue his antiquarian interests and retained his zeal for the discovery and presentation of manuscripts in the Irish language. Towards the end of his life he retired to his native co. Clare, settling at Drumellihy, near his childhood home, where he died on 18 November 1809. He was buried in the neighbouring churchyard of Kilmacduane.<br>
