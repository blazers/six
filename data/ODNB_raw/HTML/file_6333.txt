<span class="headword">Cornish,  Joseph</span>  (1750&#150;1823), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and religious writer</span>, was born at Taunton, Somerset, on 16 December 1750, the youngest of seven children of Joseph Cornish (<i>d</i>. 1776), woollen-dresser, and his second wife, Honour Ham (<i>d</i>. 1769). His parents' attachment to the dissenting ministry of Thomas Amory at Pauls Meeting and Tancred Street, Taunton, may indicate a long-standing family connection, especially given the publication in 1731 of <span class="italic">A sermon preach'd at the ordination of the Rev. Mr. Thomas Amory, and Mr. William Cornish, at Taunton, Somerset, Oct. 7, 1730</span>. Certainly, two of his father's eight brothers were Presbyterian ministers: John at Leather Lane, London, and James at Dulverton, Somerset.<br>
<br>Cornish received a classical grounding locally from a clergyman named Patch and from a Mr Glass of Westminster School. In 1765 he became one of the first pupils of Joshua Toulmin, the learned Baptist minister who had recently accepted a call to the Mary Street meeting-house in Taunton and who, in September 1767, gained him admission as a foundation student in Coward's academy, Hoxton. The divinity tutor was Samuel Morton Savage, a moderate Calvinist, who was assisted by Andrew Kippis and Abraham Rees, both Arians. While at Hoxton, Cornish began his lifelong adherence to what he called the &#145;very high Arian scheme&#146;, associated with Samuel Clarke  (<span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, 18, 1823, 617). Shortly before leaving the academy in 1772, Cornish published <span class="italic">A Serious and Earnest Address to Protestant Dissenters</span>, which went through three large editions, and his pointed and telling <span class="italic">Brief and Impartial History of the Puritans</span>, later revised by Samuel Palmer, the editor of Calamy's <span class="italic">Nonconformist's Memorial</span>, in 1797. In 1772, at the suggestion of Philip Furneaux, Cornish also applied unsuccessfully for the afternoon lectureship at Salters' Hall in succession to Hugh Farmer.<br>
<br>Amory, impressed by Cornish's learning, recommended him to George's Meeting, a small Presbyterian congregation at Colyton, east Devon, which had been vacant for four years since the departure of Matthew Anstis for Bridport, Dorset, in 1768. Toulmin had also served there from 1761 until 1765. As Colyton was relatively near his father's home, Cornish began his ministry there in July 1772 despite a unanimous call to Epsom, which he had occasionally supplied from Hoxton. He subsequently received Presbyterian ordination at Taunton on 11 May 1773.<br>
<br>Cornish never married and was to stay at Colyton for the remaining fifty-one years of his life. During his long ministry the meeting-house was enhanced by a new entrance with iron gates, built about 1800, a burial-ground, in use from 1832, and an organ, installed in 1820. His stipend at Colyton, including endowment, averaged no more than &pound;40 per annum, but until 1783 he boarded with Mr Slade, one of his leading hearers, whose house was &#145;the chief resort of various ministers visiting the town&#146;. The charge was under &pound;20 a year and Cornish therefore always found it possible &#145;to spare something for charitable purposes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, 18, 1823, 619). At the same time he saved hard to clear the debts arising from the failure of his late father's business that had been ruined by the American war, and as soon as he was able to do so he honoured his father's memory by paying every creditor in full. Calls from Tewkesbury late in 1781 and from Banbury in 1792 offered the prospect of a larger income, but Cornish resisted such temptations out of regard for his existing friends.<br>
<br>Cornish's finances were improving as a result of running a classical school, which he opened at Colyton in 1782. He initially taught in the gallery of his meeting-house, but the undertaking proved so successful that at Christmas 1796 he was able to buy a house and take boarders. The school was not confined to dissenters and continued in one shape or another until Christmas 1819. Some of his students proceeded to careers as surgeons or in the Royal Navy; others became clergymen.<br>
<br>As minister and schoolmaster Cornish earned much local affection and he was on intimate terms with three successive vicars of Colyton, George Nutcombe, Richard Buller, and Frederick Barnes. He was long remembered for &#145;his peculiar bachelor habits, his quaint old world courtesy, his chivalry to women, and his never-failing kindness to children&#146;  (Murch, 22). In old age some of those children recalled &#145;a man in knee breeches, black silk stockings and shoes, with a fund of true humour and joke&#146;, someone who was &#145;always the scholar and the gentleman&#146;  (Evans, <span class="italic">Colytonia</span>, 22). He showed a particular fondness for his apple trees, whist parties, children's tea parties, and long walks up Colyton Hill and in Shute Park.<br>
<br>Cornish remained a particularly active writer until the 1790s, several of his works being published locally in Taunton, where Mrs Jane Toulmin was long engaged as a bookseller. As a writer he is a good specimen of the class of men to whom dissent meant religious liberty rather than sectarian organization or theological system. His works sold rapidly and addressed not only theological questions but also practical religion, religious biography, and classical learning. He was paid a much needed 5 guineas for the copyright of <span class="italic">A Blow at the Root of All Priestly Claims</span> (1775) by John Johnson of St Paul's Churchyard. In <span class="italic">A Letter to the Venerable Bishop of Carlisle [Edmund Law]</span> (1777) he argued for extensive alterations to the liturgy and <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. He wrote an improved account of the life of Thomas Firmin, the seventeenth-century philanthropist, with the help of Andrew Kippis and Joseph Bretland; his defence of Firmin's decision to remain within the established church was criticized by the Unitarians. Cornish also projected a &#145;Life of John Lilburne&#146;, but the work, though announced, was never published. His last works were an article &#145;On the decline of Presbyterian congregations&#146;, published in the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span> (1819), and some short pieces, foremost among which was a supportive letter of September 1798 which he sent, together with 5 guineas, to Thomas Williams, who had been imprisoned for selling Paine's <span class="italic">Age of Reason</span>.<br>
<br>Cornish's comments on dwindling congregations appear to have been based upon first-hand experience. By 1793 he had successfully built up a following at Colyton of &#145;about eighty&#146;, but on 28 April 1814 four neighbouring ministers wrote to him suggesting that he should retire in favour of a Calvinistic successor  (Polwhele, 2.314). He flatly refused, quoting in his defence John Lavington, himself a high Calvinist, &#145;Should the number of your hearers lessen, do not be discouraged so as to grow remiss in your endeavours: remember Jesus Christ preached an excellent sermon to one woman&#146;  (Murch, 336). Consequently, a new meeting-house was built in 1819 for the Calvinistic dissenters. Cornish continued to discharge his ministerial duties until August 1823, when he was attacked by illness. He assisted at the Lord's supper on 5 October, but died four days later. He was buried beneath the entrance to his meeting-house on 17 October, and a memorial tablet to his memory was placed above the spot. James Manning, minister of Exeter, officiated and subsequently published an abridged version of Cornish's autobiography in the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span> (1823). His death was &#145;universally lamented&#146; &#145;by men of all parties&#146; who had come to respect his charity, classical scholarship, instruction of youth, and writing  (Murch, 336, 342). Among Cornish's benefactions was a sum of &pound;400 given to the London Presbyterian Fund.<br>
