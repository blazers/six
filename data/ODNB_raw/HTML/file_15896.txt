<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lake,  Arthur</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1567, <em>d.</em> 1626), <span class="occ">bishop of Bath and Wells</span>, was the son of Almeric Lake (1519&#150;1594), a burgess of Southampton; he was a younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15903/', "Sir Thomas Lake")</script>, secretary of state to James I. He was baptized in St Michael's Church, Southampton, on 30 September 1567 and educated at King Edward's Grammar School, Southampton, during the headmastership of the eminent Walloon divine, Adrian (or Hadrian) Savaria. From there, in each case as a scholar, he went first to Winchester College, in 1581, and then to New College, Oxford, in 1587. He graduated BA in 1591 and proceeded MA in 1595, and BD and DD in 1605, when he was allowed to defer some of the academic exercises owing to his work in London on the translation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, for what became the King James <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Lake was fellow of New College from 1589 to 1600, and fellow of Winchester from 1600. Several letters survive from his time as an Oxford tutor, including reports to parents on their sons' progress accompanied by accounts to be settled such as bills for lessons in French and singing, and for broken windows.<br>
<br>Lake received a series of benefices in his native Hampshire, first at Havant (1599&#150;1601) from the crown, then at Hambledon (1601&#150;3) and Chilcomb (1603&#150;6) from Bishop Thomas Bilson of Winchester, and at Stoke Charity (1605&#150;8) on the presentation of Sir Thomas Clark. By 1603 Bilson had made Lake his chaplain, and in 1605 he promoted him to the archdeaconry of Surrey. Although most of the archidiaconal records for his time are lost, Lake did sit as a judge in the diocesan high commission at Bishop's Waltham from 1606 to 1608 and was one of Archbishop Richard Bancroft's commissaries for his visitation of Winchester diocese in 1607.<br>
<br>Lake's major patron was his brother, Sir Thomas, who secured him the mastership of St Cross Hospital in Winchester in 1603, the deanery of Worcester in 1608, the wardenship of New College in 1613, and, in 1616, the bishopric of Bath and Wells. As dean of Worcester Lake helped to recover a lease let contrary to law, and together with the organist, Thomas Tomkins, oversaw the construction of a new organ and in 1612 composed an anthem, &#145;Know ye not that a prince, a great prince, is fallen this day in Israel&#146;, for the funeral day of Prince Henry. Lake's wide intellectual interests led him in 1616 to endow lectureships in mathematics and Hebrew at New College, and volumes on history, geography, and Arabic grammar as well as theology are well represented in the substantial benefaction of books he made to the college in 1617. On his return to New College in 1613 he acquired the rectory of Stanton St John, a college living, and served as vice-chancellor of Oxford in 1616/17, remaining at Oxford until the end of the academic year despite his consecration as bishop of Bath and Wells on 8 December 1616.<br>
<br>Thereafter Lake lived in his diocese, where he was an energetic governor in spiritual and secular affairs. He personally conducted his three visitations of 1617, 1620, and 1623, and regularly heard disciplinary cases, usually in his episcopal palace at Wells. His diocesan government was facilitated by his friendship with many key officials, including Archdeacon Timothy Rivett of Bath, Archdeacon Samuel Ward of Taunton, his chancellor, Arthur Duck, and, from 1621, the new dean of Wells, Ralph Barlow. Lake's central concern as bishop was to spread the gospel. At Oxford he had been a distinguished preacher, with no less a figure than John Rainolds procuring copies of his sermons, and at Bath and Wells he delivered courses of sermons in the cathedral, and also preached on visitation, at the ordination of ministers, and at the public penance of those found guilty of incest, schism, and other crimes, the latter being a practice unparalleled among his fellow bishops. Lake probably also preached at local combination lectures, and certainly maintained close links with the clerical preaching &eacute;lite of Somerset, which included puritans such as Richard Bernard of Batcombe and William Sclater of Pitminster; Sclater, indeed, became Lake's chaplain.<br>
<br>Lake brought into the diocese a number of preachers educated at New College, and was the last Jacobean bishop to require non-preaching ministers to undertake theological exercises to deepen their knowledge and improve their chances of qualifying for preaching licences. He also founded a public library at Bath Abbey for the benefit of local clergy. His evangelical fervour even embraced the New World, for in a fast sermon before the House of Lords in July 1625 he urged that the gospel be taken to the American Indians, and told John White of Dorchester, his fellow collegian and founder of the Massachusetts Bay Company, that but for his age he would accompany him to the New World.<br>
<br>Although Lake was merely one of a number of preaching pastors on the Jacobean bench of bishops, his career and diocesan work is unusually well documented. Often indulgent towards moderate puritans, Lake did not share their entrenched hostility to the Church of Rome, and counted among his friends at least one former recusant, Lady Elizabeth Booth of Bath. Lake espoused a moderate Calvinism, holding to the doctrine of hypothetical universalism, and was acutely conscious of the divisive consequences for parish religion of controversial divinity, a point which he emphasized in his sermons, and in private advice to Samuel Ward in 1618, while Ward was attending the Synod of Dort. Lake is the only Jacobean bishop whose diocesan sermons survive in bulk, and many contain clear expositions of scripture and hark on perennial themes such as repentance, faith, and self-knowledge.<br>
<br>Lake never married. He fell ill in London while attending parliament, and died on 4 May 1626, having made his last confession to his friend, Bishop Nicholas Felton of Ely. He was buried in Wells Cathedral, though without the pleasing epitaph, a play on <span class="roman">Ezekiel</span> 47, which he had specified in his will. On the other hand, Lake's expressed wish that his sermons be published &#145;for the good of younger students&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/152/99) was observed: a folio volume appeared in 1629, containing ninety-nine sermons preached at Oxford, London, and the court, as well as in Somerset, together with eleven religious meditations, all prefaced by &#145;A short view of the author&#146; by John Harris, who had been a fellow under Lake at New College. Harris's panegyric places Lake in the tradition of primitive episcopacy, and though some of his claims are unverifiable or dubious, others are vindicated by the record. <span class="italic">Ten Sermons upon Severall Occasions</span>, originally preached at Paul's Cross and Winchester, appeared in 1640, and Lake's &#145;Theses de Sabbato&#146; was published in 1641, appended to <span class="italic">Of the Morality of the Fourth Commandment</span> by William Twisse, another fellow of New College in Lake's time as warden. Six sermons by Lake at Worcester in 1613 were prepared for publication in 1661 but remained in manuscript (Folger Shakespeare Library, V.a.394).<br>
