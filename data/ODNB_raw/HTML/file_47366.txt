<span class="headword">Hodgson, Sir  Mark</span>  (1880&#150;1967), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 19 November 1880 in Newington, Hull, the son of Joshua Hodgson, a boilersmith, and his wife, Lydia. His mother died when he was eight years old and his father left home when he was young, so he was brought up by relatives in Sunderland, where he attended Diamond Hall School before taking on an apprenticeship as a plater and continuing his education in evening classes at the local technical college. He became increasingly involved in the local affairs of the United Society of Boilermakers and Iron and Steel Shipbuilders, being appointed in 1913 as the Tyne and Wear representative on the executive council, and serving as chairman of the council from 1923 to 1936, and then as general secretary until 1948.<br>
<br>In contrast to his distinguished predecessors, Robert Knight and John Hill, Hodgson had a relatively short and straightforward period as leader of the boilermakers. He nursed the union's recovery from the inter-war depression, and represented its interests effectively during the Second World War. He was involved in complex negotiations on overtime, relaxation of working practices during the war, dilution, and the development of a pioneering pay-as-you-earn income tax. He played the role in local affairs which had come to be associated with his office, as a magistrate, chairman of the Newcastle Co-operative Printing Society, and a leading light of Methodism. However, this was also a period of increasing state intervention, with expanding opportunities for union leaders to play a role in public administration at both local and national levels. Hodgson began in a relatively modest way as a member of the National Arbitration Tribunal and the North-East Industrial Development Association. Then in his so-called retirement he went on to play a major role in the development of post-war regional policy, through the North-East Housing Association and as chairman of the Northern Regional Board for Industry from 1949 to 1965. Moreover, he participated in the administration of the newly nationalized industries, through membership of an inquiry into the organization of the National Coal Board in 1948 and as chairman of the Railway Users' Consultative Committee from 1951 to 1955.<br>
<br>Hodgson was a man of average height with dark hair and a moustache. In 1900 he married Elizabeth Jane Davis from Sunderland; they had a son and two daughters. No doubt affected by the loss of his own parents early in life, he had close and warm relationships with his family: his younger daughter worked as his secretary, and his son was the boilermakers' solicitor. However, beneath a modest, establishment appearance on the right wing of the Labour Party, Hodgson was highly energetic and independent. Following a long life of public service, for which he was appointed OBE in 1938 and a knighthood in 1945, Hodgson died on 17 October 1967 at his home, 31 Kenton Road, Kenton, in Newcastle, and was cremated in Newcastle. He was survived by his wife.<br>
