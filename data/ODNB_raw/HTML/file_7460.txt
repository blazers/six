<span class="headword">Dell,  Jonas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1665?), <span class="occ">soldier and religious writer</span>, may have fought in the parliamentarian army in the civil war. Nothing is known about his origins or early life, but in 1658 he attacked a corrupt establishment thus: &#145;I did not think at Marston Moor fight, nor several other engagements since, that ever any of the innocent lambs of God should have been beaten and put into prison &hellip; for crying out against the ministers of Antichrist&#146;  (Dell, <span class="italic">A Voyce</span>, 44). Certainly, his <span class="italic">Christ Held Forth by the Word</span>, dedicated before September 1646 to &#145;my honourable Collonel Rich&#146;, suggests he was by then a soldier. This work concluded that &#145;Christ is so our liberty, to redeem us from the bondage of the law, from the bondage of ceremonies, and from the bondage of human ordinances&#146;  (sig. D2). Such views were common in radical circles, and soon the Quakers provided organization for many of those that shared them. Dell later recalled that &#145;till Christ was made manifest in me I was not saved, nor had no life as to God, though I was high in profession and knowledge outwardly&#146;  (Dell, <span class="italic">Forms</span>, 48). He may himself have been earlier a Baptist, for he argued against them in 1657 that &#145;I am come out of your ground, and I cannot observe your fashions&#146;, and was forced therefore to &#145;disown you &hellip; who are degenerated from what you were&#146;  (Dell, <span class="italic">A Voyce</span>, 38, 95).<br>
<br>It seems that Dell joined the Quakers in 1655&#150;6, certainly before George Fox's arrival in the country in 1657. When serving in Scotland at the garrison of &#145;Holmdell&#146; (perhaps Helmsdale) in Sutherland, he tells us, he had argued with a group of Baptists who held the doctrines of free will and falling away, and with another Baptist officer, one W. P. (probably William Packer, later deputy to Major-General Fleetwood), who had written a &#145;scandalous paper which was handed up and down in the regiment, from one to another, making a scorn of me&#146;  (Dell, <span class="italic">Forms</span>, 11). W. P. accused him of antinomianism (which he denied) and of opposing the literal truth of the resurrection (a view he vigorously defended). Dell may have earlier been attached to the free-will group, for he confessed of them that &#145;you do something more resemble the true church than they in outward things&#146;  (ibid., 11). He wrote <span class="italic">Forms the Pillars</span> in 1656; the work would have been longer &#145;but that this great marsh [march] out of this onked [unkind] nation of Scotland into England, hath prevented me&#146;  (ibid., 72). In December 1657 he was resident in the capital, referring to &#145;my neighbour anabaptists in the city and suburbs of London&#146;  (Dell, <span class="italic">A Voyce</span>, 92). Though <span class="italic">A Voyce</span> was &#145;written and published to go abroad in the army&#146;, Dell seems by now to have been at the point of leaving it, disillusioned with the Cromwellian establishment, resentful of ceremonious respect for rank, and contemptuous of &#145;carnal weapons&#146;. Spiritual warfare, however, was another matter: on 28 December 1657, &#145;in the night upon the Guard in Paul's that great cathedral, when as I was reproving the souldiers for sin in the power of God, and directing them to the light&#146;, Dell was engaged in polemical combat by John Mercer, a Baptist officer  (ibid., 89).<br>
<br>Jonas Dell is reported to have died at Stepney in 1665. Perhaps, many years earlier, he had married and had children. The administration of the will of a Jane Dell of Stepney was granted to her son John in November 1667, but in February the following year, probate of the estate of John Dell of Stepney was granted to his principal creditor, Maria Haffnaile.<br>
