<span class="headword">Lyon,  John</span>, seventh Lord Glamis  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1521, <em>d.</em> in or before 1559), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the son of John Lyon, sixth Lord Glamis (<i>d</i>. 1528), and his wife, Janet Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1537), second daughter of George Douglas, master of Angus, and sister of Archibald Douglas, sixth earl of Angus. The seventh lord was still a minor when he succeeded his father in 1528.<br>
<br>In July 1537 Lyon and his mother, who had married as her second husband Archibald Campbell of Skipness, and Lyon's brother George and several others were apprehended on charges of conspiring to poison James V. These charges against Lady Glamis and her family probably originated in the family's close connection to the Douglases. In addition a long-standing dispute over the ward of the earldom of Erroll, sold by the sixth Lord Glamis to George Leslie, fourth earl of Rothes, in 1527, and over the ward of the lordship of Glamis itself, purchased by Rothes in the following year, may have created enmity between the latter and the Lyons, and encouraged Rothes to conspire against Lady Glamis and her family, not only to vindicate a reputation which was under shadow at court, but also to end the dispute in his favour and to his own financial gain. Lady Glamis was tried, convicted of treason, and publicly executed. Lyon was himself tried on 18 July 1537 on a charge of concealing his mother's conspiracy and was condemned to death, but since he was a minor, aged sixteen, his execution was deferred, and he remained a prisoner in Edinburgh Castle at the crown's expense. He later claimed that he had been misled into making a confession on the understanding that his lands would not be forfeit.<br>
<br>Lyon's estates were forfeited, however, and annexed to the crown on 3 December 1540. The king had been distributing the Glamis lands among his friends from September 1537 and continued the grants until 1542. Lyon was released from prison following James's death on 14 December that year, and his lands and title were restored to him by act of parliament on 15 March 1543. On 6 February 1544 he married Janet Keith, daughter of Robert, Lord Keith, and sister of the third Earl Marischal; they had two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17278/', "John Lyon")</script>, who became eighth Lord Glamis, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17286/', "Thomas Lyon")</script>, who was master of Glamis for much of his life, and also one daughter, Margaret. It took several years to recover all the Glamis lands, most notably those in the barony of Kinghorn, gifted to James Kirkcaldy of Grange and not recovered until after William Kirkcaldy's forfeiture in September 1548 for his part in the murder of Cardinal Beaton.<br>
<br>In the early years of Queen Mary's minority Glamis was most closely associated with the opponents of the queen mother, Mary of Guise, and the cardinal. He supported the earl of Arran's flirtation with protestant preaching in 1543 and allowed the former Dominican friar John Rough to preach at Glamis kirk. Mary of Guise anticipated a reconciliation with Glamis in 1544, but it appears that he remained in opposition to the pro-French orientation of the regime for another two years. Between 1546 and 1547 he sat on the privy council on four occasions, and in November 1547 he was present at the siege of Broughty Castle, then occupied by English forces.<br>
<br>Thereafter Glamis disappears from public life. There is a charter to him dated at Glamis on 4 October 1548, and he was served heir to his grandmother, Elizabeth Gray, countess of Huntly, in 1549. On 17 April 1550 his eldest son was infeft in the family estates, reserving a liferent to the parents. He &#145;spent his latter years abroad, where having contracted a sickness he came home&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scots peerage</span>, 8.283). He had died before 18 September 1559, when John Stewart, fourth earl of Atholl, had a gift of the ward.<br>
