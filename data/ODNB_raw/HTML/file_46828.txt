<span class="headword">Lamont, Sir  James</span>, first baronet  (1828&#150;1913), <span class="occ">Arctic yachtsman</span>, was born at Knockdow on 28 April 1828, the only son of Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander Lamont (1784&#150;1861) of Knockdow, Toward, Argyll, and his wife, Jane (1793/4&#150;1880), daughter of Alexander Chrystie of Balchrystie, Fife. He was proud that his family was the senior cadet branch of the clan Lamont and was later president of the Clan Lamont Society. He was educated at Rugby School and the Edinburgh military academy. In 1846 he became ensign and second lieutenant in the 91st Argyllshire regiment of foot serving at the Cape of Good Hope, but resigned in 1849 when his uncle left him a fortune. He then gave his time to managing his Scottish and West Indian estates and to travelling, mainly in the Arctic; between his travels he lived in London.<br>
<br>Lamont took his Board of Trade certificate as master to enable him to command his own ship. In 1858 he took the yacht <i>Ginevra</i>, 142 tons, to Svalbard, Edge Island (where he had to winter), Kelihau Bay, and Kalvpunter&#151;all poorly charted. There he caught seals, walrus, and grouse. In 1859 he chartered the walrus hunter <i>Anna Louisa</i> for a sporting voyage to Edge Island, Bell Sound, Ice Fjord, Green Harbour, Thousand Islands, and Hope Island. In 1862 he went to Nova Scotia and Labrador. He also went on pleasure and sporting trips to the Mediterranean (in 1863&#150;4) and to South Africa. In 1869 Lamont took the <i>Diana</i>, 179/230 tons, to Novaya Zemlya, Matochkin Shar, the Kara Sea, the west of Svalbard, the east coast of Spitsbergen, Fairhaven, and Bell Sound, charting a reef. The next season he took the <i>Diana</i> to Kolguyev, Novaya Zemlya, Vaigach Island, Matochkin Shar, and Jan Mayen. In 1871 he went to Edge Island, Barents Island, Cape Mitra Smeerenburg and Prince Charles Foreland, and to lat. 80&deg;50' N, long. 17&deg; E. He sailed thousands of miles in Arctic waters, recording his voyages in <span class="italic">Seasons with the Sea-Horse</span> (1861) and <span class="italic">Yachting in the Arctic Seas</span> (1876), both of which contain information about land and marine natural history and about navigation, tides, currents, and meteorology. They also contain maps and views by an artist taken by Lamont to record the landscapes. Two of the views have long remained in the <span class="italic">Arctic Pilot</span>, published by the hydrographic office to help pilots recognize the coast.<br>
<br>Lamont was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, from 1861 until 1887 when he resigned because he was out of sympathy with it, and of the Geological Society. After unsuccessfully contesting Paisley as a Liberal in 1857, he was Liberal MP for Buteshire in 1865&#150;8. He favoured reducing property qualifications for voters and the relief of dissenters from all tests and disabilities. In 1868 he married Adelaide Eliza (<i>d</i>. 1925), second daughter of Sir George William Denys, second baronet, and they had two sons (one of whom died young) and a daughter. He was created baronet on 16 July 1910. As well as his travel books he published <span class="italic">A Lecture on the Civil War in America</span> (1864) and wrote for the <span class="italic">Scottish Field</span> on natural history and country life. After a year bedridden he died at Knockdow on 29 July 1913. He was survived by his widow and was succeeded by his son Norman (1869&#150;1949), who was Liberal MP for Buteshire (1905&#150;10), and a member of the Legislative Council of Trinidad (1915&#150;23). His attractively written books brought knowledge of the Arctic to a wide audience.<br>
