<span class="headword">Cokayn <span class="st"> [Cokayne]</span>,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1620, <em>d.</em> 1691), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, eldest son of John and Elizabeth Cokayn, was born at Cotton End, Bedfordshire, and baptized on 16 January 1620 at Cople, Bedfordshire. Bulstrode Whitelocke placed Cokayn's father firmly (and admiringly) in &#145;the mediocrity &amp; middle estate &amp; condition &hellip; of a smalle Estate, yett having sufficient to live comfortably &amp; conveniently, not riotously, yett plentifully&#146;  (Spalding, 56). George was admitted pensioner, on 25 February 1636, at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1640. On 2 December 1642 he was appointed lecturer at All Hallows Barking, London. During the civil war he served as chaplain to the regiment of Colonel Charles Fleetwood. In 1646 he wrote an epistle of commendation for Tobias Crisp's <span class="italic">Christ Alone Exalted</span> (1643). In this he stated:<blockquote>You shall find the sum of this Work, to be the sole exaltation of the Lord Jesus in Saints and Duties. &hellip; Now, if the world shall baptize this Doctrine <i>Antinomianism</i>, the Lord grant that all the Doctrine preached throughout the world, may deservedly be called by that name.</blockquote>This early piece of Cokayn's writing also reveals his radical views on ecclesiastical polity:<blockquote>I know nothing you have that is long-lived but Jesus Christ &hellip; even the Kingdom of Heaven, so far as it is made up of forms and administrations, shall wither and die, but the Kingdom of God within you shall never be shaken.</blockquote>In 1647&#150;8 he lectured at St Michael, Crooked Lane, London. Some time during these years he became pastor to an Independent church which had been gathered by Nicholas Lockyer, and in 1647 he married Abigail, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Plott (<i>d</i>. 1697). In 1648 he obtained the ministry at St Pancras, Soper Lane. His Independent congregation followed him there.<br>
<br>Cokayn's church comprised prominent civic leaders of London during the revolutionary era such as Alderman Robert Tichborne, Alderman John Ireton, and Colonel Rowland Wilson. It was probably upon the recommendation of Wilson (MP for Calne) that he was invited to preach before the House of Commons on 29 November 1648. The sermon, later published under the title <span class="italic">Flesh Expiring, and Spirit Inspiring</span> (1649), was blatantly political in nature. Barely a week before the purge of the House of Commons by Colonel Thomas Pride, Cokayn boldly hinted what was soon to take place. &#145;God mingles with nothing&#146;, he told the Commons, and went on to quote <span class="roman">Isaiah</span>, 1: 25: &#145;&#147;And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy Tin&#148;&#146;  (Cokayn, <span class="italic">Flesh Expiring</span>, 4). He urged that &#145;you delay not to do Justice&#146; and &#145;think not to save yourselves by an unrighteous saving of them, who are the Lords and the Peoples known Enemies&#146;  (ibid., 25). And he unmistakably enunciated his millenarian aspiration: &#145;The Saints that walk with God in Union with Holiness and Righteousness are the men by whom God at last will judg all the causes of the sons of men&#146;  (ibid., 17).<br>
<br>In 1649&#150;50 Cokayn was chaplain in the household of Wilson, then one of the sheriffs of London; and when Wilson died in early 1650 he was wholly trusted by Wilson's widow, and consequently played an important part in her marriage to Sir Bulstrode Whitelocke later in the year. On 15 August 1651 he was again appointed chaplain to Fleetwood in a northern campaign against Scottish forces. In 1652&#150;3 he was involved in the millenarian agitation in London and publicly associated himself with Christopher Feake, John Simpson, and Vavasor Powell, all of whom were leading Fifth Monarchy Men. He was also said to have held meetings with dissatisfied republicans such as Colonel Edward Sexby and Major John Wildman after the proclamation of Cromwell as protector. In the meantime, however, on behalf of Whitelocke, now ambassador to Sweden, he frequently met the Cromwellian government, especially John Thurloe, secretary to the council of state. In later years he was to provide Thurloe with intelligence. In late December 1658 he was invited to preach before the City magistrates on a day of humiliation for the calling of Richard Cromwell's parliament. When the army took power and chose Fleetwood as commander-in-chief in October 1659, he was &#145;very great with Fleetwood and the officers of that party&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Bulstrode Whitelocke</span>, 536).<br>
<br>Upon the Restoration, Cokayn either resigned or was ejected from the ministry of St Pancras. In 1661 he joined other Independent ministers in repudiating a Fifth Monarchist insurrection led by Thomas Venner. His activities, however, continued to give cause for suspicion on the part of the government. He co-authored with Henry Jessey <span class="italic">Mirabilis annus</span> (1661) and was probably responsible for <span class="italic">Mirabilis annus secundus</span> (2 vols., 1662). These collections of &#145;prodigies&#146; were meant to show &#145;the more visibly&#146;, as it is clearly stated in the preface to <span class="italic">Mirabilis annus secundus</span>, that &#145;God doth from Heaven testifie against the Prophane, Superstitious, Apostatizing, and Persecuting Spirit of this day&#146;. During the years 1661&#150;4 he preached at various conventicles in London as well as in the country, sometimes joining his church with those of Nathaniel Holmes, Joseph Caryl, Matthew Barker, and George Griffith. It was also reported that his house in Soper Lane was frequented by Fifth Monarchy Men. He was arrested in 1664 but was released on bail. His house was searched in 1671. In spite of all these difficulties, he visited Whitelocke at Chilton Lodge in Wiltshire freely and frequently during the years 1666&#150;75, and preached there in the hall. In 1672 he was licensed as an Independent teacher in his house at Red Cross Street, outside Cripplegate, London. Warrants were again issued in 1678 for his appearance and for the search of his house, and he was convicted for unlawful preaching at the Old Bailey in 1682 and 1683.<br>
<br>Cokayn continued his ministry at Red Cross Street until 1690, and there was a close intercommunion between his congregation and the church of John Bunyan in Bedford. In 1688 he wrote a preface for Bunyan's <span class="italic">Acceptable Sacrifice</span>, and may have been the author of <span class="italic">A Continuation of Mr. Bunyan's Life</span>. He was also instrumental in the creation of the Presbyterian&#150;Independent Common Fund, to which he contributed &pound;100 in 1690. Cokayn died at Red Cross Street on 21 November 1691, and was buried on 27 November at Bunhill Fields. He was survived by his wife, two sons (John and William), and a daughter (Elizabeth). He had land, a mansion house, and a number of messuages in Cardington, Bedfordshire.<br>
