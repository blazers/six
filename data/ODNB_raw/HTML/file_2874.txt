<span class="headword">Booth <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Mumford]</span>,  Catherine</span>  (1829&#150;1890), <span class="occ">evangelist and writer</span>, was born on 17 January 1829 at Ashbourne, Derbyshire, the fourth of five children. Only she and her younger brother, John, survived. Her father, John Mumford (1804&#150;1879), was a coach builder and wheelwright, and for some years a Wesleyan Methodist lay preacher. Her mother, Sarah Milward Mumford (1802&#150;1869), was a devout Methodist. Catherine Mumford was educated by her mother and soon came to share her mother's serious faith. By the time she was twelve she had read the <span class="roman">Bible</span> from cover to cover eight times, as well as works by John Wesley, John William Fletcher, and Charles Finney. She spent much of her childhood at home, partly because she suffered from a curvature of the spine and consumption but also because her mother feared that she would meet others who might not share her serious religious convictions. Catherine Mumford's childhood was marked by her father's difficulties. John Mumford broke with the Methodists and took to drink in the early 1840s. His subsequent irregular employment caused his family considerable economic difficulty. The Mumfords' only son emigrated to America in 1849 and occasional references in letters between Catherine and Mrs Mumford make clear that he did not share their religious convictions.<br>
<br>The Mumfords moved to the London area in 1845 and settled in Brixton. Catherine Mumford was a member of the Wesleyan chapel until her ticket of membership was denied over a controversy within the connection. She was loosely associated with a group of Methodists expelled during the &#145;fly sheets&#146; controversy of 1849. This group sought both greater connectional democracy and openness and the pursuit of a more zealous, evangelistic faith. Catherine began to attend services with the Reformers. She soon met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31968/', "William Booth (1829&#150;1912)")</script>, a pawnbroker's assistant and lay preacher already noticed for his energy and devotion. Catherine and William were engaged to be married in 1852.<br>
<br>From 1852 to 1855 Catherine Mumford continued to live in Brixton with her mother. She taught Sunday school, read widely, and assisted her mother with lodgers and other efforts to make ends meet. She carried on an extensive correspondence with her fianc&eacute; (now in the British Library manuscripts collection). William began his career in ministry. After several years as a circuit preacher for the Reformers and a short period studying with the Independents, he joined the Methodist New Connexion in 1854 and began to study and preach in preparation for ordination. On 16 June 1855 Catherine and William Booth were married at Stockwell New Chapel in London by an Independent minister, the Revd David Thomas. For the next two years William worked as an itinerant evangelist for the Methodist New Connexion. A regular circuit was the usual assignment, but the Connexion regarded William Booth as an especially gifted evangelist. The Booths were deeply committed to revivalist work in the tradition of Americans James Caughey and Charles Finney, and they were very happy with the success of William's labours. Catherine's first child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31969/', "(William) Bramwell Booth (1856&#150;1929)")</script>, was born in 1856 and the baby accompanied them on their travels.<br>
<br>In 1857 William was assigned to his first Methodist New Connexion circuit at Brighouse, Yorkshire, and Catherine gave birth to her second child, Ballington. In 1858 William was ordained and assigned to Gateshead, where the Booths remained until 1860. They were a great success and more than doubled the congregation. Catherine gave birth to two more children, another Catherine in 1858 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49017/', "Clibborn, Catherine Booth-")</script>] and Emma in 1860. During these years she also published an influential pamphlet on female ministry and began her own preaching career. Her pamphlet was occasioned by the 1859 evangelistic tour of England by the American holiness speaker and writer Mrs Phoebe Palmer (1807&#150;1874). During her tour the Revd A. A. Rees, minister of the Bethesda Free Church in Sunderland, wrote a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Reasons for not Cooperating in the Alleged &#145;Sunderland Revivals&#146;</span>, to encourage others to shun Palmer's meetings. Rees asserted that the injunctions of St Paul against female teaching were universal and women were to remain in private under subjugation to men. Catherine then realized her long-standing ambition to write about female preaching. Her pamphlet, <span class="italic">Female teaching, or, The Rev. A. A. Rees versus Mrs Palmer, being a reply to the above gentleman on the Sunderland revival</span>, was published in December 1859, just days before the birth of her daughter Emma.<br>
<br>Catherine's argument rested on what she termed a common-sense reading of scripture. Passages were considered in light of the particular verse as well as within the context of the chapter and the whole <span class="roman">Bible</span>. The historical context was also considered. She argued, for example, that Paul's command &#145;let your women keep silence in the church&#146; was a charge to the women of Corinth, not to women in all times and places, and it should therefore be read with an earlier passage in which Paul directed women to cover their heads when they prayed or prophesied. She also pointed to the women preachers and prophets in the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New</span> testaments, and the passage in Joel; &#145;your sons and daughters shall prophesy&#146;. Her pamphlet was not hermeneutically original. She drew heavily on the writing of the Methodist Adam Clarke and other nonconformist theologians. Her argument was significant, however, because she made no distinctions between a man's and a woman's call to preach. She argued that any woman called to ministry had the &#145;right to preach&#146; without any &#145;man-made restrictions&#146;. She did not believe women's preaching heralded the last days, like many nineteenth-century prophetic figures, nor did she claim women to be the weak, the foolish, or the low. Rather, she asserted that the church must be committed to vigorous soul-saving and that women were essential to that mission. This argument distinguished her from most of her contemporaries, who thought women could preach only with an extraordinary call and when their authority did not extend to other areas of church life. Her pamphlet was widely read and a second edition was printed in 1861. It was substantially revised and reprinted by the Salvation Army in 1870 as <span class="italic">Female Ministry, or, Women's Right to Preach the Gospel</span>, then much reprinted, anthologized, and quoted.<br>
<br>In 1857 Catherine began to speak in public, addressing female temperance audiences and Band of Hope meetings. She also began to speak on occasional Sundays after her husband's sermon. In 1860 this work became a necessity when her husband fell ill and left Gateshead to recover at a clinic. She took his place in the pulpit while continuing to run her household and care for her four children. She wrote to her husband, &#145;I must try to posses my soul in patience and do all in the kitchen as well as in the Pulpit to the Glory of God&#146;  (C. Booth to W. Booth [1860], BL, Add. MS 64802, fol. 145). This unusual circumstance was accepted by the Connexion and the chapel and her preaching was both acclaimed and condemned in the local press. One newspaper claimed she wore her husband's clothes when she preached. She enjoyed preaching and wrote to her mother, &#145;I felt quite at home on the platform&#151;far more than I do in the kitchen&#146;  (C. Booth to parents, 23 Dec 1857, BL, Add. MS 64804, fol. 63).<br>
<br>In 1861 the Booths left the Methodist New Connexion when the conference refused to consider William's request to devote all his time to evangelism and assigned him to a regular circuit. The Booths began a series of independent revivals in Cornwall, Wales, the midlands, and the north over the following four years. Their work met with resistance from Methodists and other nonconformists. Some objected to itinerant evangelists, particularly to the Booths' revivalism, while others forbade female preaching. Still, during these years the Booths established a number of significant connections across the country that were important to the development of the Salvation Army. Catherine became a prominent independent preacher and received many invitations to address congregations. Their son Herbert was born in 1862 and daughter Marion in 1864. In February 1865 Catherine was invited to conduct a revival for the Free Methodists in London. In July William joined her in London and began to preach in the East End, with the support of the editors of the evangelical weekly newspaper <span class="italic">The Revival</span>. London offered both a wide range of opportunities for evangelistic work for the Booths and a settled home for their family, and they decided to remain there. Catherine gave birth to her seventh child, Eva, later called Evangeline, in December 1865[<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62097/', "Booth, Evangeline Cory")</script>]. She continued to work as an independent revivalist, speaking in chapels and halls in London and elsewhere. Her last child, Lucy, was born in 1868. In 1865 William established the East London Christian Mission. He preached in the streets and in rented halls with the assistance of a number of well-established London evangelicals. Catherine's work supported her family during these early years and also raised funds to support the Mission, although the financial position of neither her family nor the Mission was ever secure.<br>
<br>The Mission adopted a structure of class meetings, circuits, and annual conferences loosely based on the Methodists. Catherine served on the several committees, attended the annual conferences, and preached frequently at Mission meetings. The Christian Mission grew to seventy-two mission stations in England and Wales by 1879 and it employed 127 evangelists. That year it transformed its structure and adopted a new name, the Salvation Army. This structure gave William Booth, as general superintendent for life, authority over the Mission's property and budget, and the power to establish and close mission stations and to hire and appoint evangelists. Uniforms were adopted, a series of ranks, each with its own duties and responsibilities, was developed, and military vocabulary was coined to describe the work. The Army soon opened corps in Europe and throughout the British empire.<br>
<br>Catherine Booth never held an official title but came to be known as the Army Mother. Her influence was felt in the Army's theology and practice, particularly in relation to women. Holiness was crucial to the Salvation Army's theology, and Catherine wrote and preached extensively on this doctrine. Holiness theologians taught that all believers must renounce sin, and that when infused with the Holy Spirit their hearts, minds, and wills would become the very likeness of God. Holiness was the most important requirement for office in the Salvation Army. This doctrine allowed for women's enhanced authority, because women and men could equally attain it, and the significance of other differences between men and women was therefore diminished. The Salvation Army institutionalized women's right to preach the gospel and thousands of women were local corps officers, divisional officers, and leaders in the Salvation Army's social services beginning in the mid-1880s. Catherine was the most important force in establishing women's position in the Army and a powerful example to the Army's new converts. She frequently addressed Salvation Army meetings and large audiences in halls throughout Great Britain and published extensively in Salvationist newspapers.<br>
<br>The prominence of Catherine Booth and other Salvationist women distinguished the Army from most other Victorian Christian denominations. Many Christians insisted that women's preaching was unscriptural and brought women out of their rightful private sphere. It was considered by many a particular disgrace for a mother to appear in public and encourage other young women. Others admired Catherine Booth's preaching. The <span class="italic">Primitive Methodist Quarterly Review</span> (new ser., 7, 1885, 441) declared that she &#145;combined a facility of speech, a profound acquaintanceship with the spiritual power of the Cross and a knowledge of the subtle movements of the heart&#146;.<br>
<br>In addition to preaching Mrs Booth was the author of many books, including <span class="italic">Practical Religion</span> (1878), <span class="italic">Aggressive Christianity</span> (1880), <span class="italic">Holiness</span> (1881), <span class="italic">Mrs Booth on Recent Criticisms of the Salvation Army</span> (1882), <span class="italic">The Salvation Army in Relation to Church and State</span> (1883), and <span class="italic">Popular Christianity</span> (1887), all published by the Salvation Army. She was active in the social purity campaigns&#151;against prostitution and other vice&#151;of the 1880s and, along with other leading Salvationists, was involved in W. T. Stead's 1885 crusade to raise the age of consent.<br>
<br>Catherine Booth was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1888 and in that year she ceased all public activity. She died on 4 October 1890 in Clacton. Over 30,000 people lined the streets of London to watch her funeral procession on 14 October, and she was buried in Abney Park cemetery, London. The <span class="italic">Bible Christian Magazine</span> called her the &#145;most famous and influential Christian woman of the generation&#146;, and the London and provincial press eulogized her as a preacher, writer, and social purity activist.<br>
