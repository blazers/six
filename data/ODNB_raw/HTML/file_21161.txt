<span class="headword">Palk, Sir  Robert</span>, first baronet  (1717&#150;1798), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and administrator in India</span>, was born in December 1717, apparently at Ambrooke, Ashburton, Devon, and was baptized on 16 December 1717 at the Old Mission House, Ashburton. He was the second son of Walter Palk (<i>b</i>. 1686), yeoman farmer, and his wife, Frances Abraham. He was educated at Ashburton grammar school and at Wadham College, Oxford, from where he graduated in 1739. Having taken deacon's orders, on 27 April 1746 he entered the Royal Navy as chaplain to the <i>Namur</i>, Edward Boscawen's flagship. After seeing action against the French fleet off Cape Finisterre (3 May 1747), the <i>Namur</i> proceeded to the Coromandel coast (4 November 1747).<br>
<br>In July 1748 Palk arrived at Fort St David, at that time the chief British settlement while Fort St George at Madras was under French control (1746&#150;9). Early in 1749 the company's chaplain at Fort St David, Francis Fordyce, was dismissed after publicly insulting Robert Clive. Palk, &#145;this very worthy and able divine&#146;  (Love, <span class="italic">Report</span>, v), was invited to replace Fordyce, which he did on 1 April 1749. This created confusion over the seniority and placement of the other chaplains. As a consequence, in October 1750 Palk sailed with the fleet to Bombay to resign his service and to seek formal employment with the East India Company. In March 1751 Palk returned to Fort St David, where he was reinstated.<br>
<br>When Fort St George was restored by the French to the East India Company, Palk accompanied the government back to Madras (April 1752). Once again there was confusion over the numbers and seniority of the chaplains, so the Revd Robert Palk was appointed &#145;Paymaster and Commissary in the Field&#146; (August 1752). In this position Palk associated with Major Stringer Lawrence, with whom he formed a lifelong friendship. In April 1753 and May 1754, during the contest for the Carnatic between Chanda Sahib (favoured by the French) and Muhammad Ali (supported by the British), Palk was deputed envoy to the raja of Tanjore, and prevailed on that prince to give assistance to the British candidate. In January 1754 Palk and Henry Vansittart were the two delegates appointed to discuss terms of settlement with the French agents, Father Lavaur, M. de Kerjean, and M. Bausset, at Sadras, a Dutch settlement between Pondicherry and Madras. No agreement could be reached. At the end of 1754 Palk and Vansittart arranged a provisional peace treaty at Pondicherry. Peace was eventually signed on 11 January 1755.<br>
<br>During these years Palk developed a taste for matters political and commercial rather than religious. From a letter written on 26 October 1755 by the historian Robert Orme, a colleague of Palk's at Madras, a glimpse can be gained of some of the characteristics that identified the man. According to Orme, Palk had &#145;long since&#146; given up studies of history and theology, and had thrown himself into active engagement with the contemporary affairs of the British at Madras. Palk enjoyed a reputation at this time for decency and a desire to conciliate everybody, even at the risk of being seen as all things to all men. Palk's early support for Thomas Saunders (governor from 1750 to 1755) changed to indifference when Palk became friends with Stringer Lawrence, whose relations with Saunders were acrimonious. Palk also received substantial financial benefits from activities put his way by Lawrence, making &#145;at least &pound;10,000 from two he came with into India&#146;  (Love, <span class="italic">Vestiges</span>, 2.485&#150;6). Palk's influence in the community as chaplain, paymaster, and commissary was such that his opinions of Saunders and Lawrence swayed public opinion against the former and in favour of the latter. When in 1758 the directors of the company instructed Palk to confine himself to his religious duties and to go to Fort St David, he decided to return instead to England. While there he married, on 7 February 1761, Anne (1738&#150;1788), daughter of Arthur Vansittart and sister of his friend Henry Vansittart, now governor of Fort William, Bengal. They had three daughters, two of whom died in adolescence, and a son.<br>
<br>Palk renounced his holy orders, and on 2 October 1761 entered the East India Company's civil service, and in company with Stringer Lawrence returned to Madras (16 October 1761), where he was appointed to council. When George Pigot resigned on 14 November 1763 Palk succeeded him as governor of Madras. In 1765 Lord Clive obtained a grant from the Mughal emperor Shah Alam of the five districts known as the Northern Circars, for the Madras presidency. In 1766 Colonel John Caillaud was sent from Madras to take possession of them. But Nizam Ali, <i>subahdar</i> of the Deccan, to whom the territories had previously belonged, resented the transfer, and threatened to invade the Carnatic with a large army. Palk, alarmed for Madras, and with his usual desire to placate antagonists, hurriedly directed Caillaud to come to terms with the nizam. On 12 November 1766 a treaty was signed at Hyderabad, by which the company agreed to leave the Guntur Circar in the hands of the nizam's brother Basalat Jang, and to pay a tribute of eight lakhs of rupees a year for the remaining territory. The worst article in the treaty, however, was the second, by which the British promised to give the nizam military assistance &#145;to settle the affairs of his Highness's government in everything that is right and proper&#146;, a vague expression which, after Palk's departure in January 1767, involved the Madras government in the nizam's attack on, and the resulting war with Haidar Ali, the sultan of Mysore.<br>
<br>On his return to England in 1767 Palk was &#145;well received by both the King and the Court of Directors&#146;  (Love, <span class="italic">Report</span>, viii). He had accumulated a large fortune in India, from his various salaries, gifts from local dignitaries, and army contracts, and from his own commercial activities. In 1769 he purchased and greatly enlarged and improved Haldon House, near Exeter. His old friend General Lawrence resided with him, and on his death in 1775 left all his property to Palk's children. In return, Palk set up a large monument to Lawrence's memory within his estate, on the summit of Haldon Hill.<br>
<br>Palk was never a director of the East India Company, but his friendships with Laurence Sulivan and others kept him in constant contact with Indian affairs. He took a great interest in political matters, and was MP for Ashburton in 1767&#150;8 and 1774&#150;87. He generally supported the government, but took an independent line on Indian matters. On 19 June 1772 he was created a baronet. Palk Strait, which separates Sri Lanka from India, was named after him. Palk died at Haldon House on 29 April 1798, and was buried at Dunchideock churchyard. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son, Lawrence (1766&#150;1813).<br>
