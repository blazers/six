<span class="headword">Stewart,  James</span>, duke of Ross  (1476&#150;1504), <span class="occ">archbishop-designate of St Andrews</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14589/', "James III, king of Scots")</script>, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18050/', "Margaret of Denmark")</script>. Born early in 1476, James was immediately created marquess of Ormond, and along with his elder brother, the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14590/', "James IV")</script>, he spent his early youth in Stirling Castle in the care of his mother until her death in 1486. His tuition was directed by George Shaw, abbot of Paisley. On 23 January 1481 he was granted the lands of the earldom of Ross and the castle of Dingwall, following the forfeiture of John Macdonald, fourth lord of the Isles; on 5 April following he received the lordships of Brechin and Navar, and about the same time was created earl of Ross.<br>
<br>The Anglo-Scottish treaty of 1486 proposed the marriage of Ross to Katherine, sixth daughter of Edward IV; this was agreed in November 1487, and, to elevate the prince to an appropriate dignity, on 29 January 1488 he was created duke of Ross and earl of Edirdale, as well as being confirmed in his existing titles. However, the treaty negotiations foundered, lapsing altogether with the death of James III at Sauchieburn on 11 June 1488. Immediately afterwards Ross was moved to Edinburgh Castle, where he and his elder brother were placed in the keeping of Patrick Hepburn, Lord Hailes, an outstanding figure in the new regime, who in the parliament of 6 October 1488 was formally constituted the duke's governor. Ross remained in the royal household until about 1495, when he set up an establishment of his own, evidently on an ambitious scale, his agents in Flanders purchasing substantial quantities of furnishings, fabrics, and utensils, funded partly by the sale of salmon from their master's estates.<br>
<br>In October 1493 and again in June&#150;July 1494 Ross made occasional, brief attendances at council sessions, usually in the company of William Scheves, archbishop of St Andrews. It is possible that Ross was receiving some education in government and the law, and that Scheves&#151;out of favour but still involved in the royal administration&#151;was helping to provide it. On the eve of the Scottish incursion into England in September 1496, the spy John Ramsay reported to Henry VII that Ross might be recruited to the pro-English cause, but nothing came of this. As heir presumptive the duke did not attend with the host, however, but remained in Edinburgh with senior lords who included the justiciar, Lord Lyle, and George Brown, bishop of Dunkeld.<br>
<br>After 1487 no provision was made in treaty negotiations for Ross's marriage, and it is likely that even before 1497 James IV, eager to fill the episcopate with compliant servants, intended his brother for high office in the church. After Archbishop Scheves died, on 28 January 1497, the king secured his brother's appointment to the see, initially as administrator until Ross had reached the age of thirty and could be consecrated. In the summer of 1497 Ross's trading activities substantially switched gear in order to fund foreign travel and the necessary expenses at Rome, as well as to purchase items necessary for a major prelate, such as a new seal and several signet rings&#151;and a tombstone.<br>
<br>In or after December 1497 the new postulate travelled to Rome for papal confirmation of his appointment; he was back in Scotland by the following June. In January 1498 he was also made commendator of Holyrood Abbey; commends of the similarly wealthy Dunfermline and Arbroath abbeys followed, in June 1500 and July 1503 respectively.<br>
<br>From 1493 until 1497 Ross occasionally sat with the lords hearing civil causes; after that date his attendances, while still sporadic and often brief, became more frequent, notably in the sessions of June&#150;July 1498 and January 1499. On the death of the second earl of Huntly in June 1501, Ross was appointed chancellor, and from early July 1501 he was a member of the king's daily council. Also in July 1501 he served his first turn of intensive duty in a session on civil causes, a duty which he again performed in the sessions of February&#150;March 1502 and of January&#150;April and November&#150;December 1503. However, throughout Ross's tenure of the chancellorship, the effective custody of the great seal probably lay with William Elphinstone, bishop of Aberdeen, at that time keeper also of the privy seal.<br>
<br>Ross was never consecrated archbishop. On 4 January 1504 he witnessed a royal charter at Edinburgh, but died there, presumably suddenly, on the 12th or 13th following. On or shortly before 29 January he was buried in the chancel of St Andrews Cathedral, commemorated by the tombstone he himself had purchased at Bruges in 1498. His early death has left him an enigmatic figure. The scandalous circumstances of his appointment to the primacy, together with the very slight impression left by him in the records, caused Herkless and Hannay to present him as a rather lumpen, passive opportunist, without discernible virtues or vices. A eulogistic reference to a &#145;Roscia duca&#146; in <span class="italic">Orlando Furioso</span> has been ascribed to an encounter with Ariosto while Ross was visiting Rome; however, this refers to the son of a reigning Scottish king, by custom the duke of Rothesay, and seems likely to have been purely literary in derivation. The fulsome tribute in Henry VII's safe conduct of December 1497 is equally a matter of form, and sheds no true light on the young duke's character.<br>
