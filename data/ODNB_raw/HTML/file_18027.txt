<span class="headword">Marbeck,  Roger</span>  (1536&#150;1605), <span class="occ">college head and physician</span>, was probably born at Windsor, where his father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18026/', "John Marbeck (c.1505&#150;1585?)")</script>, was organist. He is thought to have been educated at Eton College, and in 1552 was elected student of Christ Church, Oxford, where he probably lived for about fifteen years, graduating BA on 26 January 1555, and MA on 28 June 1558.<br>
<br>Although Marbeck was apparently never ordained, he held several clerical positions. On 3 February 1559 he was made prebendary of Withington in Hereford Cathedral. In 1562 he was senior proctor, and again in 1564, and on 18 November of the same year he was appointed first public orator for life, with a yearly pension of 20 nobles (&pound;6 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.) from the university chest. Copies of some of his speeches and addresses, which are notable for their elegant Latinity, are among the Rawlinson MSS in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.<br>
<br>Early in 1565 Marbeck was made canon of Christ Church; and after some negotiation with the visitor, Nicholas Bullingham, bishop of Lincoln, he was unanimously elected provost of Oriel College by the whole body of fellows on 9 March 1565. He fulfilled the role enthusiastically, immediately ordering three absentee fellows to return and dismissing the dean, Francis Webber, for refusing to take the oath of allegiance to Queen Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Early in 1566 the queen paid a visit to Oxford, and Marbeck, who was &#145;deliciae Latinarum literarum&#146;, delivered a Latin speech. The queen received him very graciously, and said to him, &#145;We have heard of you before, but now we know you.&#146; She visited Oxford again in the same year on 6 September, and Marbeck again delivered the customary Latin oration. At this time he seems to have been a particularly popular and distinguished member of the university. However, his marriage to Anne Williams, daughter of Alderman Thomas Williams of Oxford, led to his resigning all his offices, due to her Catholicism, and her &#145;notorious whoredoms&#146;  (Gilpin). His wife died soon after. They do not seem to have had any children.<br>
<br>Marbeck then turned his thoughts to medicine. Where he studied medicine is unknown, but on 1 July 1573 he became bachelor of medicine at Oxford, and the following day, doctor of medicine. Marbeck joined the College of Physicians, London, and was elected fellow about 1578. He was the first registrar of the college, and after filling that office for two years, he was on 3 November 1581 elected for life, with a salary of 40<i>s</i>. a year, plus various fees of 3<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. According to Munk, he was a careful and diligent registrar.<br>
<br>Marbeck filled various other college offices: censor (1585, 1586), elect (1597), and consiliarius (1598, 1600, 1603, 1604). During this time he re-established his acquaintance with the queen, and was appointed chief of the royal physicians. In 1589, at the age of fifty-three, he was admitted to Gray's Inn, an honorary distinction offered to a number of well-known men of the time.<br>
<br>In September 1596 Marbeck accompanied the Lord High Admiral Howard in the expedition against Cadiz. There is in the British Library  (Sloane MS 226) a beautiful manuscript, probably written by Marbeck himself (he was a noted calligrapher), entitled &#145;A breefe and a true discourse of the late honorable voyage unto Spaine, and of the wynning, sacking, and burning of the famous towne of Cadiz there, and of the miraculous ouerthrowe of the Spanishe navie at that tyme, with a reporte of all other accidents thereunto appertayning, by Doctor Marbeck attending upon the person of the right honorable the lorde highe admirall of England all the tyme of the said action&#146;. Another manuscript copy is in the Bodleian Library  (MS Rawl. D. 124), and it is printed, without Marbeck's name, in Hakluyt's <span class="italic">Voyages</span>  (1599, 1.607). A pamphlet, entitled <span class="italic">A Defence of Tobacco</span> (1602), is attributed to Marbeck because his name appears in an acrostic forming the dedication.<br>
<br>Marbeck died at the beginning of July 1605, and was buried in St Giles Cripplegate, London, on 5 July. He left a considerable collection of manuscripts in his own hand, now in the Bodleian Library.<br>
