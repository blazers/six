<span class="headword">Pickles,  William Norman</span>  (1885&#150;1969), <span class="occ">general practitioner and epidemiologist</span>, was born on 6 March 1885 in Camp Road, Leeds, where his father was in general practice; he was the second of the six sons, of whom five qualified as doctors, of John Jagger Pickles and his wife, Lucy Dobson. Pickles went to Leeds grammar school and afterwards studied medicine at the medical school of the then Yorkshire College and at the Leeds General Infirmary, where he qualified as a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries in 1909. After serving as resident obstetric officer at the infirmary, he began a series of temporary jobs in general practice. In 1910 he graduated MB, BS, London, after two failures in the final examination. He proceeded MD in 1918.<br>
<br>Pickles first visited Wensleydale as a <i>locum tenens</i> for Dr Hime of Aysgarth in 1912. After serving as a ship's doctor on a voyage to Calcutta, he returned to Aysgarth later that year as second assistant to Hime. In 1913 he and the other assistant, Dean Dunbar, an old friend from his student days, were able to purchase the practice. Dunbar died in 1934, but Pickles remained in practice in Wensleydale until he retired in 1964; he left only in the First World War, during which he served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as a surgeon-lieutenant. In 1917 Pickles married Gertrude Adelaide (<i>d</i>. 1969), daughter of Harry Tunstill, a wealthy mill owner from Burnley who had a holiday house in Wensleydale. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>&#145;Will Pickles of Wensleydale&#146; achieved fame during his lifetime as the embodiment of the ideal general practitioner or country doctor. He achieved this not by his outstanding intellect, but because of his warm humanity and deep interest in his patients, most of whom were visited in their own homes; surgeries were of little importance. In introducing one of his lectures Pickles said:<blockquote>And as I watched the evening train creeping up the valley with its pauses at our three stations, a quaint thought came into my head and it was that there was hardly a man, woman or child in all those villages of whom I did not know the Christian name and with whom I was not on terms of intimate friendship. My wife and I say that we know most of the dogs and, indeed, some of the cats.</blockquote>When he was forty-one, Pickles read <span class="italic">The Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment in Heart Affections</span> by Sir James Mackenzie, who had made many important contributions to medical knowledge from his general practice in Burnley. His example fired Pickles. In 1929 an epidemic of catarrhal jaundice broke out in Wensleydale, affecting 250 people out of the total population of 5700. Pickles was able to trace the whole epidemic to a girl whom he had seen in bed on the morning of a village fete and who he never dreamed would be able to get up that day. In this enclosed community Pickles was able to trace time and again &#145;the short and only possible contact&#146;, and to establish the incubation period as 26&#150;35 days. This was a notable contribution, for it not only established the infective nature of the disease, but also its surprisingly long incubation period. An account of the epidemic in the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 24 May 1930) received scant notice at first. Two years later Pickles published in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> (2 July 1932) the records of an outbreak of Sonne dysentery; and in the next year he recorded (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 4 November 1933) for the first time in Great Britain an epidemic of myalgia, or Bornholm disease, later known to be an infection with the Cox-Sacchie virus.<br>
<br>In 1935 Pickles described some of his work to the Royal Society of Medicine. After this meeting, a leading article in the <span class="italic">BMJ</span> stated, &#145;It may mark the beginning of a new era in epidemiology&#146;. Major Greenwood, the outstanding epidemiologist of the time, suggested that Pickles should write a book on his observations, which was published in 1939 as <span class="italic">Epidemiology in Country Practice</span>. This became a medical classic, and established Pickles's reputation. It also showed how a country practice could be a field laboratory with unique opportunities for epidemiologists.<br>
<br>Pickles had now become famous. He was Milroy lecturer at the Royal College of Physicians, London (1942), and Cutter lecturer at Harvard (1948). A member of the Royal College of Physicians since 1939 he was elected a fellow in 1963, having in the meantime been awarded the Bisset Hawkins medal (1953). In 1946 he shared the Stewart prize of the British Medical Association with Major Greenwood and in 1955 he was elected an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and was awarded the first James Mackenzie medal. He received an honorary DSc degree from Leeds in 1950. In 1953 he was elected the first president of the College of General Practitioners; he held office for three years, during which period the college was given its royal charter. In 1957 he was appointed CBE. In 1965 he became an honorary fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine and an honorary vice-president of the British Medical Association.<br>
<br>Pickles died in hospital in Northallerton on 2 March 1969 and was buried in Aysgarth. His wife died later in the same year. His epidemiological charts (1931&#150;63) have been deposited at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.<br>
