<span class="headword">Brayne,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1541&#150;1586), <span class="occ">grocer and financier</span>, was the eldest child of Thomas Brayne (<i>d</i>. 1562), a tailor (nominally a girdler), and his wife, Alice Barlow (<i>d</i>. 1566), of the parish of St Stephen, Coleman Street, London, who married on 22 January 1541. John Brayne was apprenticed on 13 March 1554 to John Bull, a grocer in Bucklersbury, London. He completed his apprenticeship, married <a href="#cosubject_68130">Margaret Stowers (<i>d</i>. 1593) [<i>see below</i>]</a> at St Dionis Backchurch on 14 January 1565, and became a successful grocer with a house and business in Bucklersbury. By 1573 the Braynes had had four children, Robert (<i>b</i>. 1565), Roger (<i>b</i>. 1566), Rebecca (<i>b</i>. 1568), and John (<i>b</i>. 1573). All were baptized at St Stephen Walbrook, the church for the eastern half of Bucklersbury, and all soon died, at least three of them in infancy. Fatefully for Brayne, his sister Ellen had married the joiner turned player James Burbage, also of St Stephen, Coleman Street, on 23 April 1559.<br>
<br>Brayne undertook financial ventures that had nothing to do with groceries, and it is for two of these that he is remembered. The earlier of the two was the building in 1567 of a professional playhouse, apparently the first purpose-built one in the British Isles since Roman times. It was east of Aldgate, near Mile End, in a court or yard belonging to a farmhouse called the Red Lion. Brayne hired one carpenter to build scaffolds for spectators and another to build the stage, and he quarrelled with both. The playhouse was not elaborate, since he probably spent only about &pound;15 on it. It was to be ready by 8 July 1567 so that a play called <span class="italic">The Story of Sampson</span> could take place there, but nothing more is known about the place, or whether James Burbage had anything to do with it. Brayne's first known financial involvement with Burbage is a loan they made jointly in 1568.<br>
<br>Burbage was instrumental in Brayne's later memorable venture. Burbage bought a lease, dated 13 April 1576, on part of the dissolved priory of Holywell in Shoreditch. There, in an open space, he meant to build the first large and costly public playhouse, to be called The Theatre. The lease ran until 25 March 1597, but Burbage probably thought of it as running until 1607, because a clause provided that he could have up to ten more years if he spent &pound;200 on old buildings there during the first ten years. Also, he could dismantle and remove the playhouse while the lease was in force. However, because Burbage had nothing like enough money for the scheme, he took in Brayne, who joined him without a written contract. Brayne was to supply most of the funds needed to erect the building, and Burbage was to have the lease put into both their names. Once the playhouse was open, the takings would pay the running costs and yield profits, most of which would go to Brayne until his investment and Burbage's were the same; then the two would share costs and profits. Brayne, now childless, spoke, according to Burbage, of leaving his share of the enterprise to Burbage's children.<br>
<br>The scheme went awry from the beginning. Burbage and Brayne planned to spend about &pound;200 but actually spent about &pound;700. They had to borrow money, then mortgage the lease. Brayne, and even his wife, had to join in putting up the building. He had to sell his house and business in Bucklersbury and moved to Shoreditch; in 1577&#150;8 he ceased to be active as a grocer. He and Burbage soon fell into bitter and occasionally violent quarrels about who had spent how much and taken how much in profits. Because the lease was mortgaged, Burbage could not add Brayne's name to it. Instead, he gave Brayne bonds worth &pound;600 guaranteeing that he would do so. The name was never added, however, and the bonds proved uncollectable. Brayne drew up a will in 1578 and left the Burbages out of it. Neither he nor his wife ever recouped his losses on The Theatre, but the Burbages prospered.<br>
<br>Brayne tried another investment in January 1580 with at least some help from Burbage. He acquired a lease for twenty-four years on The George inn in Whitechapel, into which he moved. This venture, however, came to echo that at The Theatre, and proved as disastrous to Brayne. Since the place was not functioning as an inn, Brayne, without a written contract, took an old friend, Robert Miles, goldsmith, as a partner; Miles was to restore the inn trade and share expenses and profits with Brayne. Miles also moved into the place, which did become an inn again, but not for long. Brayne quarrelled as bitterly with Miles as he did with Burbage, and eventually Miles controlled the lease. Brayne died, partly at least, because of a violent quarrel with Miles, and was buried in the churchyard of St Mary Matfelon, Whitechapel, on 15 June 1586. He was bankrupt and had hidden his goods and himself from creditors.<br>
<br>Brayne's widow, <a name="cosubject_68130"></a><span class="headword">Margaret Brayne</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1593), convinced herself that Miles was responsible for her husband's death, and Miles ejected her from The George. She pursued him at law for murder and sued him for a share in The George. Soon she evidently gave birth to a child, Katherine, and she and Miles became close friends. He readmitted her to The George, though not to a share in it, and in 1588, supported and financed by Miles, she sued Burbage for half The Theatre or the &pound;600 that Burbage's bonds to Brayne were in theory worth. The Burbages counter-sued, claiming that Brayne was childless when he died. They called Miles an adulterer and a &#145;murdring knave&#146; and Margaret Brayne a &#145;murdring ho<sup>r</sup>&#146;  (Wallace, 100, 105, 115, 121). They believed, apparently, that Miles was Katherine Brayne's father and that he and Margaret Brayne had conspired to kill her husband.<br>
<br>The Burbages squeezed Margaret Brayne out of the ownership of The Theatre in 1589. The mortgage had long been forfeit, and the mortgagee, John Hyde, legally owned the lease. He, however, was ready to return it to Burbage and Brayne's widow in return for his money, of which only about &pound;30 was still owing. Burbage's son, Cuthbert, got his patron, Walter Cope, an official in the entourage of the lord treasurer, to ask Hyde to give the lease to Cuthbert if Cuthbert paid the money. Cuthbert did so, and Hyde gave him the lease on condition that the Burbages give Margaret Brayne a proper share in the place. The Burbages became owners outright but did not honour the condition.<br>
<br>Margaret Brayne died of plague and was buried in the churchyard of St Mary Matfelon on 13 April 1593. In her will (8 April) she made Miles her heir. She left him not only her goods and her lawsuits but also Katherine Brayne, insisting that the child was her husband's and hoping that Miles would be good to her. She owed Miles so much money, she said, that all her goods &#145;will nothinge countervaile&#146;  (Wallace, 153&#150;4). Katherine Brayne also died of plague three months later; she was buried in the churchyard of St Mary Matfelon on 23 July. Miles carried on Margaret Brayne's lawsuits until 1595, when the court decided that it would not continue to hear the case until Miles had pursued the bonds of 1578 in the common law courts. This was apparently not worth his while, and, in effect, the Burbages had won. In 1597 Miles began another lawsuit against them on Margaret Brayne's behalf but soon dropped it. Because the landlord of The Theatre refused to renew the lease after the first ten years or on favourable terms in 1597&#150;8, Burbage's sons had The Theatre pulled down in the Christmas season of 1598&#150;9 and its timbers carried to Bankside for use in building the Globe.<br>
