<span class="headword">Ramensky,  Johnny</span>  (1905&#150;1972), <span class="occ">safe-breaker and gaolbreaker</span>, was born in Glenboig, Lanarkshire, on the outskirts of Glasgow, the only son in the family of three children of Lithuanian immigrants. His father, a Lanarkshire coalminer, died while Ramensky was still a child, and he was brought up in poverty by his mother, who had lost an arm in an accident. He left school at fourteen, and worked in the mines for a brief period before the family moved to Glasgow, settling in a tenement block in the Gorbals. He sold newspapers in the streets of Glasgow, but drifted into crime, and was sent to Polmont borstal, near Falkirk, in 1921, at the age of sixteen, and again in 1922, this time for eighteen months. When he came out, he and another former inmate turned to safe-breaking, putting to use the expertise he had acquired while handling explosives down the mines.<br>
<br>In 1934 Ramensky was caught breaking open a safe in a bakery in Aberdeen. As he began serving his prison sentence in Peterhead prison, his wife, Daisy (<i>n&eacute;e</i> McManus), died of a heart attack, in December 1934, and, refused permission to go to her funeral in Glasgow, Ramensky made the first of his five escapes from Peterhead. He was caught trying to cross the bridge at Ellon, 15 miles away, and as a punishment was shackled for weeks to the wall of his cell, in solitary confinement. John McGovern, MP for Shettleston, took up his case with the home secretary, and the shackles were removed: Ramensky was the last man in Scotland to be shackled in a prison cell, as well as the first to escape from Peterhead prison.<br>
<br>After his release Ramensky returned at once to safe-breaking, but his methods of blowing safes were easily identifiable, and he was convicted in 1938, and sentenced to five years in prison. However, in 1942, a few months before he was due to be released, he was taken to the War Office and asked to enlist in the army, as his skills with explosives were needed. He was trained as a commando at Achnacarry Castle, Inverness-shire, and, promoted to the rank of sergeant, he taught commandos how to blow safes, before being parachuted behind enemy lines several times to break open safes and steal military plans and secret documents. As the Eighth Army moved across north Africa he broke into safes ahead of the front line, including that at Rommel's headquarters, and when the allies captured Rome his commando unit blew fourteen safes in foreign embassies in one day. In Germany it was Ramensky who opened the strongroom and safes at Goering's headquarters in the Schorfheide.<br>
<br>Ramensky, who had changed his name to Ramsay, was demobilized in 1945 with the Military Medal. But within days he broke into a jeweller's shop in York, robbed the safe, and was sentenced to five years in prison. Freed in 1950, after seven days he was arrested again after blowing a safe at Cardonald post office, near Glasgow, and given another five-year sentence. At this point he began secretly writing his memoirs, although this was forbidden under the <span class="roman">Official Secrets Act</span>, and, hoping to find a publisher, he escaped from Peterhead in 1952 but was again captured at Ellon Bridge, and the manuscript was impounded and destroyed.<br>
<br>When he was released in 1955, Ramensky married a widow from the Gorbals, Mrs Lilly Mulholland, but he then robbed a bank in Oban, and was arrested for a raid on a bank in Rutherglen. Although his war record had been taken into account before, this time Lord Carmont, in the Glasgow high court, imposed a sentence of ten years' preventive detention, and he was sent back to Peterhead prison. In 1958 he escaped three times: after the third escape, which involved hiding under the floorboards of the doctor's surgery for a week before escaping over the wall, an inquiry was set up into how a known escaper could escape three times in one year.<br>
<br>Ramensky served nine years of this sentence. On his release in 1964 he got a job as a labourer, but after a break-in at Woolworths in Paisley he was sent back to gaol for two years. In 1967 he blew open a safe at Rutherglen and began a four-year gaol sentence, and in 1970 he fell off a roof while escaping from a safe-breaking in Stirling, and spent three months in hospital before going back to prison. Released in 1972, he was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment after being caught hiding on the roof of a large shop in Ayr in an attempt to break in: during his final court appearance his solicitor said he had been on more roofs than the legendary fiddler.<br>
<br>Johnny Ramensky died on 4 November 1972 in Perth Royal Infirmary after collapsing in Perth prison. Hundreds of mourners attended his funeral in St Francis's Chapel in the Gorbals. He had become a legend. Two popular songs were written about him in the 1950s: the actor Roddy McMillan wrote and recorded &#145;Set Ramensky Free&#146;, and the Labour MP Norman Buchan wrote &#145;The Ballad of Johnny Ramensky&#146;. He was known as Gentle Johnny because he was never violent, and his repeated prison escapes won him much public sympathy: at one point he was likened to Robin Hood escaping from the castle of the sheriff of Nottingham. A compulsive safe-breaker, Ramensky found it impossible to give up his safe-blowing activities after the war, driven by what his lawyer, Nicholas Fairbairn QC, was to describe as a lifelong compulsion to break into whatever he was out of and out of whatever he was inside. Ramensky, sentenced to more than fifty-eight years in gaol, spent over forty years in prison: most of his adult life.<br>
