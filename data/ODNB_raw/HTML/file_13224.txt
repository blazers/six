<span class="headword">Higden,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1645), <span class="occ">author and lawyer</span>, the son of John Higden (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1610) and his wife, Joane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Durden (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1610), was baptized at St Mary Putney, Surrey, on 28 August 1645. After attending Westminster School he was admitted to the Middle Temple in April 1665; he was called to the bar in 1686. &#145;A Person known to all the conversable part of the Town, for his Pleasant and Facetious Company&#146;  (Gildon, 72), he published his lively translation of the thirteenth satire of Juvenal in 1686. His version of Juvenal's tenth satire appeared a year later, with commendatory verses by John Dryden, Aphra Behn, and Elkanah Settle. Higden defended free translation against Thomas Shadwell's attacks, writing that his aim was to give &#145;Life and Spirit to his Author, by making him English, in a Modish and Familiar way&#146;  (H. Higden, <span class="italic">A Modern Essay on the Tenth Satyr of Juvenal</span>, 1687).<br>
<br>Higden's comedy <span class="italic">The Wary Widdow</span> received a disastrous single performance in 1693, soon after the success of Congreve's <span class="italic">The Old Batchelor</span>. According to <span class="italic">The Poetical Register</span> (1719), &#145;the Author having contriv'd to make so much drinking of Punch in the Play, that the Actors got drunk, and were unable to go through with it, the Audience was dismiss'd at the Close of the Third Act&#146;  (Jacob, 138). In his indignant preface to the play text Higden did not mention drunkenness, but blamed the faction against him for turning the theatre into a bear-garden by &#145;hissing, mimicking, ridiculing, and Cat-calling&#146;, the management for spending no money on the production, and the actors for not learning their lines. His play had been cut by the master of the revels, when audiences were lapping up the obscenities of &#145;the Baudy Batchelour&#146; and Dryden's <span class="italic">The Kind Keeper</span>. In his <span class="italic">Table-Talk</span>, Tom Brown remarked that Harry Higden included a great deal of eating in his comedy because authors always wrote about what they liked best. Higden's poverty during the legal long vacation, when his rooms at the Temple contained only &#145;a Rug, two Blankets, a Joint-Stool and a Tin-Candlestick&#146;, are described in <span class="italic">Letters from the Dead to the Living</span>  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.177). His later career is obscure; in the late 1690s Gildon did not know whether Higden was living or not.<br>
