<span class="headword">Ferard,  Elizabeth Catherine</span>  (1825&#150;1883), <span class="occ">Church of England deaconess</span>, was born on 22 February 1825 of Huguenot descent, the daughter of Daniel Ferard (1788&#150;1839), solicitor, of Queen Square, Westminster, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 29 June 1856), daughter of Isaac Clementson, and was the sister of Charles Cotton Ferard (1823&#150;1886) of Ascot Place, Winkfield, Berkshire, barrister, landowner, lord of the manor, and an active churchman described by <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> as &#145;a lay ecclesiastic&#146;  (15 Dec 1886).<br>
<br>The revival of the deaconess order began in the continental reformed churches, the most famous being the establishment at Kaiserwerth in Germany of a deaconess house by Pastor Theodore Fliedner in 1836. The deaconesses lived as a community ministering to the sick and poor, and teaching girls. In England the deaconess order was perceived as an alternative to religious sisterhoods, the latter largely identified with the Oxford Movement. Moreover, it was viewed as the revival of an order which had existed in the early church and which had biblical authority. The scholarly contribution of the biblical scholar John Saul Howson to the growing debate on women's work in the church, and the subsequent discussion in convocation in 1858, set the scene for the deaconess revival in the Church of England. In August 1860 William Pennefather, an Anglican clergyman, established a deaconess institution which later became known as the Mildmay Deaconess Home, but this did not evolve along Anglican lines and had a more direct influence on the deaconess revival within Methodism.<br>
<br>Following the death of her mother Elizabeth Ferard stayed at Kaiserwerth in 1858 and kept a journal for part of the time. She experienced all aspects of the work but was especially drawn to nursing. She wrote in her journal<blockquote>I again heard of the continual spreading of the Deaconess work in every direction except in England, and more than ever wished we could have something of the kind in England, where the materials for it are so abundant, could we but found a Deaconess House on the right principles without falling on the stumbling block of Romanism. (Ferard, &#145;Journal of a residence at Kaiserwerth on the Rhine&#146;)</blockquote>Back in England she stayed with the sisters of Mercy community of All Hallows at Ditchingham, gaining more experience of life in a women's community. Meanwhile her relation by marriage, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7020/', "Revd Thomas Pelham Dale (1821&#150;1892)")</script>, wanted to form a residential society of ladies for charitable work for the poor, including nursing, which would be different from and more flexible than that offered by the Anglican sisterhoods and would entail no vows. He and others founded the North London Deaconesses' Institution in a house, 50 Burton Crescent, King's Cross, London. It was approved by Archibald Campbell Tait, bishop of London, and formally opened in November 1861. Dale became the first secretary and chaplain. Elizabeth Ferard, together with Ellen Meredith and Anna Wilcox, were the first members and dedicated themselves as &#145;servants of the church&#146;. On 18 July 1862 Elizabeth Ferard was &#145;set apart&#146; by Bishop Tait as the first deaconess in the Church of England. The original rule of the North London Deaconesses' Institution stated the object as:<blockquote>the renewal of the primitive Order of Deaconesses in the Church of England, for the purpose of engaging in works of Christian usefulness &hellip; the care of the sick and poor, education for the young &hellip; [and] shall be formed as far as circumstances permit upon the model of the Institution at Kaiserwerth. (CSA Archives, Rules for the Deaconesses' Institution, established in the north of London under the sanction of the bishop, to be called the North London Deaconesses' Institution)</blockquote>A woman wishing to join would serve first as a provisional sister, then as a candidate for two years, before admission to the order. All deaconesses were known as sister but, unlike nuns, they were not then bound by vows (this was introduced in the early twentieth century). There were stringent rules governing daily life, including conduct and dress, attendance at church services, the offices of morning and evening prayer, and time for private prayer and <span class="roman">Bible</span> study.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Ferard became the head sister. She and others who joined wanted a community closer to a sisterhood than Dale had envisaged. Moreover, according to Dale's daughter and biographer, Elizabeth Ferard was:<blockquote>a manager of decision and power, and not inclined to brook interference &hellip; the Head-Sister's prejudices in favour of autocratic rule became stronger, and her conviction that strict authority was necessary, and, if the work was to prosper, must be in the hands of the Sister Superior, became firmer. (<span class="italic">Life and Letters</span>, 73, 75)</blockquote>She and Dale, who &#145;saw his cherished scheme fading away&#146;  (ibid., 75), failed to agree, and in 1868 Dale, disappointed, resigned as chaplain. Elizabeth Ferard accepted aspirant deaconesses &#145;from the higher educated ranks and not from the lower&#146;  (Sister Joanna, 220).<br>
<br>From 1869 the institution was known as the London Diocesan Deaconess Institution, until 1943 when the title changed to the Deaconess Community of St Andrew. From early days there was a combination of religious sisterhood and deaconess ministry, exemplified by the adoption of a rule and the habit, combined with work among the poor, nursing, teaching, visiting, and religious instruction. By 1873 the original premises at Burton Crescent had become too small and the community had moved to St Andrew's House, 12 Tavistock Crescent, Westbourne Park, London. In the same year Elizabeth Ferard resigned as head sister owing to ill health, and she spent her last years running St Catherine's, Redhill, a convalescent home for children which she founded and which closed after her death. She died at 16 Fitzroy Square, London, on 18 April 1883, according to community records, though her death notice in <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> and the gravestone inscription at Winkfield, Berkshire, give 19 April.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Ferard was described as &#145;a woman of splendid courage and persistence&#146;  (Robinson), whose considerable organizational powers resulted in the work steadily increasing. But she was also described as lacking &#145;some of those gifts which are thought necessary in the leader of a new movement; she did not possess that personal power of attraction which has distinguished the founders of some &hellip; sisterhoods&#146;  (ibid.). She was remembered as:<blockquote>a strict disciplinarian, with an indomitable will and a strong love of justice. She was generous and affectionate, but intensely reserved, with a shy manner that gave her an appearance of haughtiness. She had not that gift of ready sympathy which might have enabled her to win many helpers for the cause, but those who knew her well loved and respected her deeply. (Robinson)</blockquote>This critical portrait was balanced by the observation that &#145;she had an intense belief in the cause she represented, and a faith in its future which enabled her to lead what must often in those early days [have] seemed a forlorn hope&#146;  (ibid.). Not until 1987 was the deaconess movement fully integrated into the ordained ministry of the church. Although following her death Elizabeth Ferard had merely a one-line notice in <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> and no mention in the <span class="italic">Church Times</span> or <span class="italic">The Times</span>, she has from November 1997 been included in the revised calendar of the Church of England.<br>
