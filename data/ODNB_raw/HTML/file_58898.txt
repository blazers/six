<span class="headword">Turner,  Victor Witter</span>  (1920&#150;1983), <span class="occ">social anthropologist</span>, was born on 28 May 1920 at 13 Riverside Road, Cathcart, Glasgow, the only child of Captain Norman Turner (1895&#150;1975), electrical engineer and officer in the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War, and Violet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Witter (1889&#150;1966), repertory actress and a founder of the Scottish National Players. Turner was baptized into the Congregational church and received his earliest education at the Montessori School, Belmont Crescent, Glasgow (1925&#150;6), before going to the Glasgow Academy (1926&#150;31). When his parents divorced, the eleven-year-old Turner accompanied his mother to live with her parents, who had retired from Glasgow to Bournemouth: Arthur Witter (<i>d</i>. 1935) was English; his wife, Jeanie Witter (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Johnston), Scottish. Turner's estrangement from his father was to be lifelong. While attending Bournemouth grammar school (1931&#150;8) Turner developed interests in Latin and Greek classical literatures and in poetry writing, which were reflected in his initial choice of degree subject.<br>
<br>Turner studied English language and literature at University College, London, from 1939 until drafted for war service in 1941. As a conscientious objector and non-combatant, he volunteered between 1941 and 1946 to serve in 104 bomb disposal squad, 8 company, Royal Engineers. On 30 January 1943 he married Edith Lucy Brocklesby (Edie) Davis (<i>b</i>. 1921), with whom he had four sons and one surviving daughter. They established their first home in a Gypsy caravan outside Rugby, where he was based. Turner's earliest publications (1943&#150;4) were poems published in the magazine <span class="italic">Oasis</span>, which he helped to start with a wartime friend, John Bate (E. Turner, <span class="italic">Bibliography</span>; private information).<br>
<br>By the time he returned to University College in 1946 Turner had resolved to become an anthropologist and transferred into the department of anthropology which had been established in the previous year by Daryll Forde. After graduating in 1949, he moved that year, initially as a research assistant, to the University of Manchester, where Max Gluckman was establishing an outstanding centre of anthropological research with particular interests in central and southern Africa. The left-leaning ethos of the place would have been conducive to Turner's communist beliefs. Between 1950 and 1954 Turner was a research officer of the Rhodes&#150;Livingstone Institute&#151;an appointment arranged by Gluckman, who encouraged him to research among the Ndembu, a branch of the Lunda people of Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia), on account of their complex ritual life. Research carried out between December 1950 and February 1952 and between May 1953 and June 1954 was written up in a series of publications about the Ndembu that established Turner's early reputation as an outstanding fieldworker and ethnographer.<br>
<br>In 1955 Turner completed the doctorate subsequently published as <span class="italic">Schism and Continuity in an African Society: a Study of Ndembu Village Life</span> (1957). The book's extended &#145;social dramas&#146;&#151;units of disharmonic social process&#151;illustrated and explained the recurrent processes, to do with matrilineal descent and choice of residence, that lay behind the splitting of Ndembu village communities. By systematically exploring the phases of social drama (norms breached, mounting crisis, redress to limit that crisis, and recognition of the new outcome) Turner reinvigorated the Manchester school's existing concern with disputes and their resolution by embedding these processes in extended and lively case studies. Having resigned from the British Communist Party in 1957  (Deflem, 4), in May 1958 Turner was received into the Catholic church:<blockquote>After many years as an agnostic and monistic materialist I learnt from the Ndembu that ritual and its symbolism are not merely epiphenomena or disguises of deeper social and psychological processes, but have ontological value, in some way related to man's condition as an evolving species, whose evolution takes place principally through its cultural innovations. (<span class="italic">Revelation and Divination</span>, 31)</blockquote>Studies of ritual processes predominated in Turner's ensuing publications. His interest in local exegesis was evident in his celebrated portrait of a key informant: &#145;Muchona the Hornet&#146; (1959). However, Turner's unwillingness to restrict symbolic analysis to the terms of conscious local models was apparent from the essays on the symbolism of Ndembu rituals of initiation and affliction written between 1958 and 1966 that were collected, together with &#145;Muchona&#146;, in <span class="italic">The Forest of Symbols: Aspects of Ndembu Ritual</span> (1967). Among the most influential ethnographies written by the outstanding generation of social anthropologists trained immediately after the Second World War, <span class="italic">The Forest of Symbols</span> renewed symbolic analysis in anthropology and provided an important step towards Turner's own later work. Turner (who described himself as a &#145;comparative symbologist&#146;) argued that dominant symbols condense diverse meanings that cluster around two poles: the physiological and the normative. For instance, the white sap of a tree may evoke both maternal nurturance and the more abstract ideas of matrilineal solidarity and dispute. Turner's discussion of the &#145;liminal&#146; period in rites of passage that had been famously analysed by Arnold van Gennep (1909)&#151;whom Turner read in 1961, and again in 1963  (E. Turner, &#145;From Ndembu to Broadway&#146;, 7&#150;8)&#151;as an extended period &#145;betwixt and between&#146; formal statuses, highlighted the ambiguities, paradoxes, and confusion of customary categories universally typical of liminal status. Turner noted that there existed an authoritative relation between neophytes and their instructors, but among neophytes relations were commonly egalitarian.<br>
<br>Composition of the essays in <span class="italic">The Forest of Symbols</span> straddled Turner's move from the UK to the USA. After appointment as a fellow of the Center for Advanced Behavioral Sciences at Palo Alto in California 1961&#150;2, while he was working on <span class="italic">The Drums of Affliction</span> (1968), Turner left the University of Manchester (where since gaining his doctorate he had been successively Simon research fellow 1957&#150;9, lecturer, 1959&#150;61, and senior lecturer, 1962&#150;3) to join the anthropology department of Cornell University as professor (1964&#150;8). This was a particularly productive period, recognized by the award of the Rivers memorial medal of the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1965: aside from completing <span class="italic">The Forest of Symbols</span> and <span class="italic">The Drums of Affliction</span>, Turner accepted an invitation to deliver the Lewis Henry Morgan lectures at the University of Rochester in April 1966. The ensuing publication, <span class="italic">The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure</span> (1969), demonstrated his use of Ndembu analysis as a springboard to universal concerns. The first half of the book, roughly corresponding to the lectures delivered, begins with an intensive analysis of an Ndembu women's fertility ritual; initially through other Ndembu case studies, next in comparative sub-Saharan terms, Turner proceeds to argue the co-presence in African societies of two forms of sociality corresponding to the dictates of social structure and to those of &#145;communitas&#146;&#151;an egalitarian repudiation of structure. In pre-industrial societies communitas is particularly&#151;but not solely&#151;associated with liminal states. The remainder of <span class="italic">The Ritual Process</span> explores forms of communitas in more complex societies: &#145;Together [structure and communitas] make up one stream of life; the one affluent supplying power, the other alluvial fertility&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ritual Process</span>, 128, Penguin [Pelican] edition, 1974).<br>
<br>The linked concepts of communitas (based in shared humanity) and the &#145;liminoid&#146; (times and spaces outside normal social process) energized Turner's later works. Between 1968 and 1977, when professor of social thought and anthropology on the University of Chicago's &#145;Committee on Social Thought&#146;, Turner researched for and collected the essays published as <span class="italic">Dramas, Fields, and Metaphors: Symbolic Action in Human Society</span> (1974). His interests ranged widely from pilgrimage sites in Mexico, Ireland, and England&#151;presented as functional equivalents of rites of passage in less complex societies&#151;to the historical production of myth and symbol in medieval England and during the Mexican Revolutionary War.<br>
<br>From 1977 until his death in Charlottesville, Virginia, on 18 December 1983, following a second heart attack, Turner was William R. Kenan professor of anthropology and religion at the University of Virginia. Travelling widely, he pursued his interests in theatre and performance studies, in pilgrimage, and in the &#145;liminoid&#146; in complex, post-industrial societies&#151;for which he sought a neurological as well as social basis. Some of these later works were written jointly with his wife, Edith L. Turner, whom Turner had never failed to acknowledge as an influence and co-worker in earlier writings. After a requiem mass at Holy Comforter Church, Charlottesville, on 21 December, Victor Turner was cremated at Harrisonburg, Virginia. At home, family and friends re-enacted a &#145;full-scale Ndembu funeral for a tribal chief &hellip; with drums, masked dancers, ritual, and large quantities of beer and spirits&#146; (Turner and Turner, 16; Willis). Turner's ashes were placed on the peak of the island of Barra, Scotland, the home of his mother's McNeil ancestors. His wife survived him.<br>
