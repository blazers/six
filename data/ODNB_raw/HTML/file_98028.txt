<span class="headword">Spicer,  Peter</span>  (1839&#150;1935), <span class="occ">taxidermist</span>, was born in Jury Street, Warwick, on 28 October 1839, the son of John Spicer (1811&#150;1866) and his wife, Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Heynes. His father, a saddler by trade, established a taxidermy shop in Warwick; his trade label, featuring fox, hare, pheasant, and heron, also indicates that he supplied artificial birds' eyes to the trade and dealt in British and foreign bird skins. His cases of taxidermy often have a painted scene in the background, a style that was not widely adopted by British taxidermists until much later. When John Spicer died, his wife, Emma, continued taxidermy briefly, using her own trade label.<br>
<br>Peter Spicer entered the family business, and was described as a &#145;bird &amp; animal preserver&#146; at Leamington Spa, when he was married there, on 23 January 1865, to Ann, daughter of George Ward, shoemaker. He subsequently took on the business in his own name and, based in Leamington Spa, built it up to become one of Britain's most respected taxidermy operations, especially renowned for the quality of its hunting trophies and for its excellent cases of mounted birds. Typical features of the latter included a watercolour scene painted at the back, probably by Spicer, who was an accomplished watercolourist. Cases were unusually large for their subject, with depth and glass side panels adding to the air of spaciousness. Groundwork was of peat in early cases, crumpled paper in later ones. The front glass was secured by paper tape (helping to keep out dust), covered by a gilded quadrant. Spicer bird cases often featured birds of prey and grouse. Arsenic was the preferred form of preservative (despite which, several employees lived well into their eighties, and Spicer himself died at the age of ninety-five).<br>
<br>The Spicer firm was particularly known for its hunting trophies, especially fox and otter masks, but also deer heads and African species. Until about 1913 heads were prepared in the traditional way by cleaning up the skull, padding it out with fibrous stuffing, and replacing the preserved skin over it. Later the firm developed a system of iron moulds in which plaster manikins could be cast in indefinite numbers, giving consistently high quality. The skin was then fitted over the plaster shape. This &#145;tapiderm&#146; process seems to have been Peter Spicer's innovation: the use of hollow plaster manikins reduced the weight of trophies (traditional stag heads, padded with tow, clay, and plaster, were heavy), lowering freight costs and making the trophies easier for servants to handle when lifting them off the wall to clean.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife Spicer married, second, on 20 September 1877, Lavinia (<i>b</i>. 1849/50), daughter of Joseph Sims Williams, baker. After 1904 the business was called Peter Spicer &amp; Sons and operated as a partnership between Peter and his two sons (William and his half-brother, Gilbert). In its heyday, in the early twentieth century, the Spicer business had several divisions, employing at least thirty-six people, and had an outpost at Inverness to serve the Scottish deer stalking and grouse shooting industries. <span class="italic">Spicer's Stalking Records</span>, a review of past seasons with advertisements for the preparation of trophies, was issued between about 1909 and 1923. With a reputation for quality second only to Rowland Ward Ltd of London, the firm set great store by its patrons, who included King Edward VII, the Spanish royal family, the shah of Persia, and the sultan of Johore.<br>
<br>The First World War was a difficult period for the business, which by the time of Peter Spicer's retirement in 1921 had begun to diversify into other ventures, such as wax doll making. A stout, bearded man, he died at his home, 82 Leam Terrace, Leamington, Warwickshire, on 20 January 1935. His son William ran the taxidermy business until its closure in 1959.<br>
