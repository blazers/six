<span class="headword">Ewing,  Alexander</span>  (1814&#150;1873), <span class="occ">Scottish Episcopal bishop of Argyll and the Isles</span>, was born in Aberdeen on 25 March 1814, the eldest of the two sons and one daughter of John Ewing, advocate in Aberdeen, from Loch Lomond, and his wife, Elspet Aitken. After their parents' early deaths, the children were cared for by an uncle. Alexander developed an early love of poetry and languages. He was educated at the Marischal College of Aberdeen and a private school in Chelsea, where he was deeply influenced by an evangelical schoolmaster. From 1831 until 1835 he attended classes at the University of Edinburgh. He was married in 1835 to Katherine Stewart (1816&#150;1856), daughter of Major Ludovic Stewart of Pittyvaich, Banffshire: they had three sons and two daughters. Much of their early married life was spent in Italy because of Ewing's poor health. In 1838 he was ordained, returned to Italy, and then undertook charge of the Episcopal chapel in Forres for three years.<br>
<br>After his consecration as bishop of Argyll and the Isles in 1847 Ewing lived in Lochgilphead and struggled with the problems of his diocese, Calvinism in Scotland, and factional struggles in the Episcopal church. Most of his flock had been lost to emigration, but there were still 1500 in Appin, usually with no priest, and remnants elsewhere. Ewing founded the Highland and Islands Episcopal Fund to provide houses and books for his clergy and schoolteachers. But he failed to learn Gaelic, and he never managed to train enough priests who did. Taken together with his absences for reasons of health, Ewing's work as a bishop was not successful.<br>
<br>With regard to Italy, Ewing had hopes of providing espiscopacy to the Waldensians, but they did not want it, and his dream of a non-papal Catholicism in northern Italy came to nothing. With regard to Calvinism, Ewing had joined Thomas Erskine of Linlathen as early as 1836 in opposing predestination, and he later came close to a doctrine of universal salvation. It was thought that if Calvinism were undermined the presbyterian churches would give up their people to the Episcopal church; in fact the slow waning of Calvinism in the presbyterian fold took away the one advantage the Episcopalians possessed, and doomed them to irrelevance.<br>
<br>Factionalism in the Episcopal church centred on doctrines of the eucharist. Ewing's own views tended almost to the receptionist interpretation; he had been abroad during the key years of the Catholic revival, was unmoved by their sacramental doctrine, and resented an incursion of Oxford Movement clergy from England. The latter did in Scotland what they could not do in England, causing protestant zealots, whom Ewing also disliked, to oppose them with constant litigation. In 1858 Ewing wrote an open letter complaining of these controversies without which, &#145;at the time of the great Presbyterian disruption &hellip; we should have absorbed within our pale the bulk of the sober-minded and educated of Scotland&#146;. Describing himself as the only bishop born, ordained, and consecrated in Scotland, Ewing none the less found a solution to the troubles of the Episcopal church in its future alignment with, or incorporation into, the Church of England. There its tumult would be more easily contained, and the trouble-making English clergy would go home. Ewing furthered his scheme by his opposition to the use of the Scottish liturgy and his assistance, with the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishops of London and Oxford, in the celebration of a Eucharist service at Westminster Abbey. But, since incorporation would have required parliamentary approval, and alignment not much less, the scheme was impractical, but it was typical of the man&#151;a confirmed protestant whose love of the ancient Celtic church bred no interest in returning to its traditions.<br>
<br>Ewing's first wife died in 1856; he married his second wife, Alice Louisa, daughter of George Sholto Douglas, seventeenth earl of Morton, in 1862. They had one son. In his last years Ewing wintered in the warmth of Pollok House in Glasgow, still working with Erskine on theological projects. He died at Westmill rectory in Hertfordshire on 22 May 1873. His widow survived him until 1913. Perhaps the most interesting Scottish bishop of his day, he was remembered for his scholarship and his good nature, rather than for any accomplishment.<br>
