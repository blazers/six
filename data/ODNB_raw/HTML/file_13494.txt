<span class="headword">Holden,  Moses</span>  (1777&#150;1864), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, was born on 21 November 1777 at Black Horse Street, Bolton, Lancashire, the youngest of the three children of Thomas Holden, a hand-loom weaver, and his wife, Joyce. His parents moved some five years later to Preston, where Holden first worked as a hand-loom weaver. On their return to Bolton he laboured in a foundry there until disabled by an accident, after which he found employment as a landscape gardener near Preston. His love of astronomy developed at an early age, leading him to acquire an extensive library of books to guide his studies of this and other sciences. He gave talks on astronomy, and found patrons among the rising manufacturers of Preston, including Samuel Horrocks MP, to whose daughters he gave lessons in astronomy.<br>
<br>In 1814 Holden began to design his celebrated grand orrery, manufacturing its castings and gear wheels with the assistance of several local mechanics and a watchmaker. He learned to paint on glass the pictures of the planets and the various diagrams which, projected by a magic lantern, accompanied his demonstrations. His first public lecture with the orrery and lantern slides was given at the Theatre Royal in Preston in April 1815. A tour through the northern towns which followed proved so successful and profitable that for the next eleven years Holden toured continually throughout England. In 1826 he devoted the proceeds of one of his lectures to the erection of a memorial tablet in St Michael's Church, Toxteth, near Liverpool, dedicated to the astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks (1618&#150;1641), who was born and died at Toxteth. Holden published a small atlas of fixed stars in 1818 which ran through several editions, and issued a yearly almanac from 1835 until the repeal of stamp duty flooded the market with cheap almanacs. He made the acquaintance of many scientists and astronomers, including William Rogerson of the Royal Greenwich Observatory; Rogerson's letter praising the educational value of Holden's orrery and a testimonial signed by the worthies of Preston were useful advertisements. The date of Holden's marriage to Isabelle is not known. She, and their daughter, Ann Leonora (<i>b</i>. 1829), survived him; their son, William Archimedes Holden (<i>b</i>. 1818), predeceased him, leaving a young family. Holden settled again in Preston from 1828, giving courses on astronomy there until 1852 and occasionally lecturing in nearby towns. In 1834 he was presented with the freedom of the borough of Preston.<br>
<br>Holden was a skilful mechanic and made several microscopes and at least one telescope, the latter for the Revd William Carus Wilson, who declared it superior to the more expensive one he had purchased from the noted London maker Dollond. He helped to establish the Institution for the Diffusion of Knowledge in Preston, and from 1837 was an enthusiastic member of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, attending their yearly meetings until 1855. Holden frequently officiated as a Methodist preacher and, though he attended services in the established church, he took part in Wesleyan <span class="roman">Bible</span> and prayer meetings throughout his life. Despite the theatrical nature of his own lectures, he refused to attend stage plays, nor could his friends persuade him otherwise even when his son played the ghost in a local performance of Hamlet. Holden was none the less known for his ability to tell humorous stories, in a rich Lancashire accent which he never lost. In his later years he suffered from poor health, and he died at his home, one of two houses he owned in Jordan Street, Preston, on 3 June 1864.<br>
