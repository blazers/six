<span class="headword">Jekyll <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Graham]</span>, Dame  Agnes</span>  (1861&#150;1937), <span class="occ">philanthropist and political hostess</span>, was born on 12 October 1861 in Largs, Ayrshire, the sixth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51801/', "William Graham (1817&#150;1885)")</script>, Liberal MP and art collector, and his wife, Jane Catherine (1819/20&#150;1899), daughter of John Loundes of Arthurlie, Renfrewshire. From her parents she acquired many of the attributes she was to perfect later in life, notably the gift of hospitality. Her father was a patron of the Pre-Raphaelite painters and this led to her interest in the arts. She inherited his deep political convictions and Christian faith. From her mother, an accomplished pianist, she inherited a great appreciation of music. She was educated at home by governesses, and stated that she had attended classes at King's College, London; these were probably the early lectures for ladies organized by King's College in Kensington from 1878 onwards.<br>
<br>On 29 December 1881 Agnes married Sir Herbert Jekyll (1846&#150;1932), a captain (later colonel) in the Royal Engineers; he was a brother of the artist and garden designer Gertrude Jekyll. Marriage brought her new spheres in which to practise her hostessing skills. She always travelled with her husband on his postings, including to Dublin, where he was private secretary to two lords lieutenant (the earl of Carnarvon, 1885&#150;6, and Lord Houghton, 1892&#150;5), Paris, where he was commissioner for the British section of the Paris Exhibition in 1900, and Gibraltar for the War Office. Such was her devotion to her husband that she left her one-year-old first-born with her parents while she accompanied him during his inspections of fortifications in Ceylon and Singapore. Their daughters, Barbara and Pamela, married Bernard Cyril Freyberg, first Baron Freyberg, and Reginald McKenna respectively.<br>
<br>Agnes Jekyll's husband was assistant secretary at the Board of Trade from 1901 to 1911, and they entertained at their home, Munstead House, Busbridge, Godalming, Surrey. The Asquiths (who knew her as Aggie) were among their guests. During the First World War, as chairman of St John of Jerusalem's warehouse for hospital supplies, Clerkenwell, she worked unstintingly in organizing and maintaining supplies to numerous hospitals and convalescent homes. She prided herself on answering every demand for supplies promptly. She was also one of the first to volunteer to provide an ambulance service when London was subject to air raids. In recognition of her war work she was created DBE on 1 January 1918.<br>
<br>Agnes Jekyll also brought her considerable organizational skills to the public sphere particularly for the benefit of those of her own sex who were in some sort of trouble. For ten years she was chair of the visiting committee of the Borstal Institution for Girls at Aylesbury and would often serve on juries in order to do her best for girls and women who stood in the dock. In 1925 she was made a magistrate on the Guildford bench and sat regularly on the panel of the children's court. She also served from 1884 to the time of her death as a member of the East End maternity hospital committee. A &#145;mistress of all domestic lore&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 Jan 1937, 16), she promoted housekeeping skills. Her <span class="italic">Kitchen Essays</span> (1922) brought together a series of articles she had written for <span class="italic">The Times</span> through which she initiated many into the secrets of successful domestic management.<br>
<br>Agnes Jekyll's life of public service was typical of many of the women of her class and generation. While not professionally trained to run public institutions she was able to apply many of the skills and values commonly associated with the private domestic sphere to the problems of society. While she was hailed as an exceptionally able amateur, it was remarked that had she been a man she would have been &#145;a great public servant&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 Feb 1937, 16). She outlived her husband by five years, dying in her sleep at Munstead House on 28 January 1937. Her funeral took place at Busbridge church on 1 February 1937.<br>
