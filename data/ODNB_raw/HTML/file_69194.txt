<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Critchley,  Macdonald</span>  (1900&#150;1997), <span class="occ">neurologist</span>, was born on 2 February 1900 at 4 Lime Tree Villas, Ashley Down, Bristol, the son of Arthur Frank Critchley, gas collector, and his wife, Rosina Matilda, <i>n&eacute;e</i> White. Educated at the Christian Brothers' College, Bristol, he matriculated at fifteen at Bristol University. Too young to be admitted, he spent the following year studying German and Greek. In 1917 he enlisted as a private soldier and in 1918 became a cadet in the Royal Flying Corps. He returned to university after the war and graduated in 1922 with first-class honours, having found the time also to perform on stage in and around Bristol.<br>
<br>After a brief period as a house physician in Bristol, Critchley moved to London, first to the Hospital for Sick Children at Great Ormond Street, then to the Maida Vale Hospital, and finally in 1923 to the National Hospital, Queen Square. He was trained there as a neurologist by physicians such as Sir Gordon Holmes, James Collier, Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson, and Risien Russell. In 1924, the year he proceeded MD, Critchley published seven papers, including three on disorders of movement and three on disorders of calcium metabolism. His interests then shifted to those which came to dominate his later work: in 1927 he published on defects in reading and writing in children, a prelude to one of his major books, <span class="italic">The Dyslexic Child</span> (1970), for which he received the Sam T. Orton prize in 1974. It was Critchley who, in diagnosing dyslexia in Michael Heseltine's son Rupert, diagnosed it also in the father. &#145;You do realize that you are a classic dyslexic?&#146; was his question, which confirmed what had been, with Michael Heseltine, a slowly growing suspicion  (Heseltine, 14). He married on 16 April 1927 Edna Auldeth Morris (1899/1900&#150;1974). They had two sons, the elder of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74606/', "Sir Julian Michael Gordon Critchley (1930&#150;2000)")</script>, MP. Critchley's first book, <span class="italic">On Mirror Writing</span> (1928), was published in the same year that he was appointed to the consultant staff at both the National Hospital, Queen Square and King's College Hospital. Elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians at the early age of thirty, he gave the Goulstonian lecture to the college in 1931 on the neurology of old age, a topic which sixty years later became a major concern of neurology.<br>
<br>Increasingly in the 1930s Critchley's writings reflected a growing concern with higher cerebral function: the dementias, hallucinatory states, and aphasia. The Second World War radically, if temporarily, changed his direction. As surgeon captain he organized the neurological and psychiatric services for the Royal Navy. His observations in the Arctic and in the tropics provided the substance of his Croonian lecture to the Royal College of Physicians in 1945: &#145;Problems of naval warfare under climatic extremes&#146;. After the war he returned to his clinical studies of higher cerebral function and in 1953 published <span class="italic">The Parietal Lobes</span>, a landmark in the field of cognitive neurology.<br>
<br>Critchley was a brilliant teacher and was internationally renowned as a lecturer. His eminence in the profession was recognized by, among other things, his election as president of the World Federation of Neurology (1965&#150;73). He was the first elected vice-president of the Royal College of Physicians (1964). He was appointed CBE in 1962 and retired from the National Health Service in 1965, but continued to see patients for another two decades.<br>
<br>Critchley wrote extensively throughout his life. His essays were collected in three volumes: <span class="italic">The Divine Banquet of the Brain</span> (1979), <span class="italic">The Citadel of the Senses</span> (1986), and <span class="italic">The Ventricle of Memory</span> (1990); they covered topics as diverse as self-portraiture, gesture, Indian mythology and dance, criminal trials, and human attitudes to the nose. Critchley wrote biographies of the two neurologists who had influenced him most: Sir William Gowers (1949) and John Hughlings Jackson (1998). The latter was written with his second wife, Eileen Audrey Hargreaves, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bristow (<i>b</i>. 1926/7), whom he married on 23 April 1974, and was completed just before he died.<br>
<br>Critchley's manner was that of the distinguished physician of the mid-twentieth century&#151;quiet, elegant, unhurried, and always civil. An apparent aloofness of manner reflected a natural reticence which concealed from most a concern for others prompted by shrewd insight into their personalities. He avoided any unnecessary movement and counselled against exercise. In later years in his office in Queen Court, he would sit surrounded by cushions in an armchair at his desk, in the side-shelves of which were memorabilia of Oscar Wilde, pieces from his collection of paste jars, and curious objects collected in the Far East.<br>
<br>Critchley died suddenly on 15 October 1997 at his home, Hughlings House, Mill Lane, Nether Stowey, Bridgwater, Somerset, and was cremated. His second wife survived him.<br>
