<span class="headword">Morgan,  Philip</span>  (1930&#150;2005), <span class="occ">United Reformed minister and promoter of Christian unity</span>, was born on 22 June 1930 at 64 Curzon Street, Maryport, Cumbria, the son of David Lewis Morgan, a Welsh minister of the Churches of Christ, and his wife, Pamela, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hutchinson. The Churches of Christ (Disciples of Christ in the USA) was a group of congregational churches with a strong emphasis on the baptism of believers and the weekly celebration of the eucharist. Thomas Campbell, one of the founding fathers of the denomination, voiced his deep conviction in 1809 that &#145;the Church of God is essentially, intentionally and constitutionally one&#146;  (T. Campbell, <span class="italic">Declaration and Address of the Christian Association of Washington</span>, 1809, 16), a conviction Morgan was to make richly his own.<br>
<br>Morgan went for training as a Churches of Christ minister to Overdale College, part of the Selly Oak Colleges federation, and received the degree of BA in theology from Birmingham University. In 1952 he was sent to a post in the south Wales valleys and he was ordained there in 1953, serving a group of churches around Merthyr Tudful (which included Aberfan, whose sufferings in 1966 were to move him deeply). On 17 July 1954 he married Greta Mary Hanson, a 25-year-old grammar-school teacher, and daughter of Frederick Oliver Hanson, drapery shop superintendent. They had two children, Ghislaine and Jonathan. Morgan often later spoke of his five years in the valleys, along with subsequent ministries in Avery Hill, south-east London (1958&#150;62) and twin churches in Saffron Lane and South Wigston, Leicester (1962&#150;6), as very happy and rewarding.<br>
<br>In 1967 Morgan was appointed assistant general secretary of the Association of the Churches of Christ, and a year later became its general secretary. This post he held in Birmingham, combining his national responsibilities until 1980 with ministry in a joint church experiment with a parish of the Church of England in Balsall Heath, a somewhat run-down area not far from the city centre. His travelling ministry took him throughout the British Isles. Already in 1958 he had been chosen to represent the Churches of Christ on the assembly of the British Council of Churches (BCC), so he was a long-respected participant in its life when he became chairman of its division of ecumenical affairs in 1978 and then general secretary in 1980, serving until 1990.<br>
<br>Following the definition of unity in Christ reached by the New Delhi assembly of the World Council of Churches in 1961, a senior pastor in the Churches of Christ, James Gray, had published an article challenging his fellow members to take active steps to unite with at least one other denomination. That stirred Morgan to discuss with his friends and colleagues a far-reaching plan to work in this direction, strongly encouraged both by the 1964 British Faith and Order Conference's call to the churches to achieve unity by Easter day 1980, and then by the beginnings of discussions between the Presbyterian and Congregational churches for the unity they eventually achieved in the United Reformed church (URC) in 1972. His plan was built around a pattern of frequent consultation with every local Church of Christ, two rounds of which he carried through with his colleagues in his early years as general secretary. Resistance in a number of local churches was encouraged by the promise of money and manpower from like-minded circles in the USA, so eventually he arranged for the dissolution of the existing national association in order to allow those churches supporting union with the URC to establish a new national body and pursue that goal without in any way forcing the others. The unity of the majority of Churches of Christ and the URC was thus celebrated in 1981. In 1983 Morgan was elected to serve as the year-long moderator of that whole church, which he combined admirably with his BCC post.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the invitation of the URC's founding assembly to the other churches to consider closer unity had led to the establishment of the Churches' Unity Commission, involving (unlike the BCC) the Roman Catholic church. This published a set of &#145;ten propositions&#146; on &#145;visible unity&#146; in 1976. These, with the Catholic and Baptist churches accepting only observer status, then led to the Churches' Council for Covenanting, which produced its proposals for a far-reaching covenant in mid-1980. Morgan had shared in drawing up the appendix on &#145;Joint decision making for common obedience under the covenant&#146;, and under his chairmanship the board of the BCC division of ecumenical affairs presented to the assembly just before Easter 1980 a paper, &#145;Unity: why not yet&#146;, surveying the movements towards unity among the British and Irish churches. Meanwhile the BCC had been in careful discussion with a group appointed by the Roman Catholic bishops' conference for England and Wales in the light not only of the Second Vatican Council's text on Christian unity but still more of the recommendation of their national pastoral congress in May 1980 that the bishops reconsider the question of the entry of the Catholic church into the BCC. This was the single most important goal that Morgan set for himself and the council in the 1980s. It was joyously achieved by means of the dissolution of the former BCC and the founding of the new Council of Churches for Britain and Ireland (CCBI), with the Catholic church and a number of black-led churches as incoming members, in a memorable service spanning both the Anglican and Catholic cathedrals in Liverpool in September 1990. Morgan's patience, determination, pastoral insistence on full consultation at every stage, and above all prayer-filled passion to be, as he saw it, pursuing God's path of unity for the whole of Christ's church, were crucial throughout these ten years.<br>
<br>There were plenty of other matters to fill Morgan's agenda during his time as general secretary of the BCC. He eagerly led a group in considering the possibility of a British and Irish conference on church and society, whose inconclusive debates none the less provoked Lesslie Newbigin to write his worldwide best-selling <span class="italic">The Other Side of 1984</span> (1983). Morgan admirably followed through the courage of his predecessor, Harry Morton, in engaging in secret conversations with certain men of violence in Northern Ireland in the hope of finding an agreed path to peace. He also followed Morton in interpreting the policy of the World Council of Churches to support those struggling against the violence of the apartheid regime in South Africa. He encouraged those who had collaborated with their colleagues in the conservative evangelical world to initiate a &#145;nationwide initiative in evangelism&#146;, and was founding chairman of the Centre for Black and White Christian Partnership at the Selly Oak Colleges from 1978 onward. Most startlingly, he led a small group from the BCC executive to the Falkland Islands after the war there, on the way to the World Council of Churches central committee in Buenos Aires.<br>
<br>Morgan was delighted, on leaving the BCC as it transmuted into the Council of Churches for Britain and Ireland, to take up a local pastorate at St Andrew's United Reformed church in Frognal, Hampstead, north London, for five years up to retirement. He enjoyed a happy family life with his wife, Greta, who also became a minister in the URC. He died of aspiration pneumonia following a stroke, at Barnet General Hospital, London, on 17 October 2005, and was survived by Greta and their two children. A thanksgiving service was held on 2 November in St Andrew's, Frognal.<br>
