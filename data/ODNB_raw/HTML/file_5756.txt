<span class="headword">Cochrane,  Thomas <span class="st"> [Robert]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1482), <span class="occ">royal favourite</span>, has left few traces in official records, and much of what is known about him is drawn from later chronicles, above all the histories of Lesley (1568&#150;70), Pitscottie (<i>c</i>.1579), and Buchanan (1582). All these writers see Cochrane as the evil genius of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14589/', "James III of Scotland")</script>, a low-born favourite who turned the king against his brothers Albany and Mar, became earl of Mar on Mar's death, and richly deserved his violent death, hanged over Lauder Bridge on 22 July 1482 by an incensed Scottish nobility. The Cochrane legend grew until by the early eighteenth century Cochrane, quaintly described as &#145;Prime Minister&#146; of James III, became the subject of a short pamphlet war in London, conducted by individuals seeking to attack or defend the ministry of Sir Robert Walpole. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries a reaction set in among historians who endeavoured to rehabilitate Cochrane, praising him as an important architect in the service of an unjustly maligned Renaissance monarch&#151;all this on the strength of two isolated references in contemporary official records, a name on a notarial instrument, and the stories of chroniclers who, with one exception, are not contemporaries of the events which they describe and who cannot agree on Cochrane's forename, far less his occupation.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, it is impossible to ignore Cochrane, for there survives one striking piece of near contemporary evidence as to his existence and closeness to James III. In the first edition of his commentary on book 4 of Peter Lombard's <span class="italic">Sentences</span>, published in Paris in 1509, John Mair, who had grown up in Haddingtonshire during James III's reign, referred to a Robert Cochrane as the victor in a single combat with one William Tor, commenting that the fight, which was much talked about in its day, occurred in that king's reign. According to Mair, it was widely said at the time that Cochrane achieved his victory through witchcraft. The witchcraft theme is also to be found in a fragmentary, and probably contemporary, chronicle which attributes the death in 1480 of James III's brother John, earl of Mar, to his association with witches and warlocks. Thus a tentative link might be made between Cochrane and Mar's death, a connection greatly exaggerated in transmission by later writers.<br>
<br>The Cochrane of official record is Thomas rather than Mair's Robert, though probably the same individual. On 22 January 1480 the lords of council assigned the sum of &pound;60 Scots to Thomas Cochrane; it had formerly been promised by four northern lords to Sir John Colquhoun, a royal usher who had been killed at the siege of Dunbar Castle in May 1479. Colquhoun's &pound;60 Scots had been reassigned by the king to Cochrane, which suggests that he was a royal household servant who had recently come to James III's attention, perhaps through his victory over Tor.<br>
<br>Chronologically, Cochrane's next appearance in contemporary records is found in an otherwise unremarkable notarial instrument of 20 May 1482 appointing procurators in a land transfer; one of the named procurators is &#145;Thomas Cochrane, constable of the castle of Kildrummy&#146;. There can be little doubt that this is the same Cochrane as in the council decision of January 1480, for the surname, though common enough in Renfrewshire and Lothian, is startlingly unfamiliar in Aberdeenshire. Two months before his demise at Lauder, then, Cochrane is to be found as keeper of the principal castle in Mar, which in turn suggests that, while James III may never have given him the title of earl, Cochrane could well have had possession of some or all of the revenues of Mar, amounting in total to &pound;505 13<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>. Scots. Later local evidence points to his being responsible for building the formidable tower-house of Auchindoun, 20 miles from Kildrummy; if true, this might explain his later reputation as a stonemason.<br>
<br>Thus it would appear that Cochrane, a southerner, was active in the north-east as a royal agent, that he was very well rewarded by the crown for his pains, and that his presence in Mar was a snub to George Gordon, earl of Huntly, and to the earl's kinsman James Ogilvy of Deskford and Findlater. Huntly wanted Mar and the keepership of Kildrummy; Ogilvy, already in possession of Glenfiddich, near which Auchindoun stands, may have seen Cochrane as a threat. Both men were conspicuously present at the Lauder muster and hangings in 1482, and subsequently they duly acquired Kildrummy and Auchindoun.<br>
<br>Cochrane's third and last appearance in the records, on 2 May 1483, describes him as &#145;umquhile thomas of cochran&#146;, already dead and forfeited. The main event at Lauder had been not the hanging of Cochrane and other familiars, but the seizure of the king; and Cochrane was certainly never a primary target for the opposition, unlike, for example, Archbishop William Scheves (<i>d</i>. 1497). Cochrane's involvement in Mar's death cannot be proved. In the last analysis his real crime may have been his attempt to feather his own nest in Mar with James III's blessing, but in the teeth of implacable local hostility.<br>
