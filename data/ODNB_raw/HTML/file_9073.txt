<span class="headword">Fairclough,  Samuel</span>  (1625&#150;1691), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was probably born at Barnardiston, Suffolk, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9072/', "Samuel Fairclough (1594&#150;1677)")</script>, rector of Barnardiston, and his wife, Susan (<i>d</i>. 1638), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2521/', "Richard Blackerby")</script>. Dedicated to the ministry at birth, Fairclough, like all his siblings, &#145;had the knowledge of &hellip; scripture in [him] from the very breasts&#146;  (Clark, 179). In May 1643 he followed his brothers, Nathaniel and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9071/', "Richard Fairclough")</script>, to Emmanuel College, Cambridge. After graduating MA in 1650, he held a fellowship at Gonville and Caius College until 1656, when he left Cambridge to take the rectory of Houghton Conquest, Bedfordshire. On 25 October of the previous year he married his stepsister, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1670&times;1681?), the only daughter and heir of William Folkes of Kirtling, Cambridgeshire, whose widow had married the elder Fairclough in 1641. In 1660 Fairclough was ejected to make room for the sequestered incumbent, Edward Martin, president of Queens' College, Cambridge, and retired to his eldest sister's manor at Finchingfield, Essex. There he joined his father, brother Richard, and brothers-in-law Richard Shute and George Jones, who had all lost livings at the Restoration, though the latter two subsequently conformed. After four or five years Fairclough resumed preaching in London, although it is not clear that he ever undertook a settled pastoral charge. In November 1672 he obtained a licence as a congregationalist teacher in Chippenham, Cambridgeshire, where he planned to lease the house of the vicar, Isaac Archer, before deciding instead to live &#145;among relations near Norfolk&#146;  (Storey, 148). By 1681 he had returned to London and in 1690, at least when in town, was living in Hatton Garden.<br>
<br>Besides editing <span class="italic">Suffolks Tears</span> (1653), a collection of elegies upon the death of Sir Nathaniel Barnardiston, Fairclough wrote a short account of the exemplary life and death of the young Anne Barnardiston, which was published in 1682 with her funeral sermon by John Shower, and reprinted in Shower's <span class="italic">Mourner's Companion</span> (1692). He also added a preface to Samuel Hudson's funeral sermon for Richard Shute, <span class="italic">David's Labour and Rest</span> (1689). Fairclough died in London, aged sixty-six, on 31 December 1691, and was buried in the vault he had built for his wife in the church at Heveningham, Suffolk, where George Jones had ministered since 1670. Fairclough arranged for the annual payment of 20<i>s</i>. to the rector to help ensure that the vault would not &#145;be broken open or our bones &hellip; disturbed&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/410 fol. 386). Having no children of his own he divided most of his considerable property, in Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, among the children of his brothers, John and Nathaniel. He also made a number of charitable bequests. In addition to conveying his house and lands at Kedington, Suffolk, to the rectors of that parish, and establishing a scholarship at Gonville and Caius College, he left &pound;10 each to five presbyterian divines&#151;Richard Stretton, Richard Mayo, Samuel Stancliffe, Nathaniel Vincent, and Edward Lawrence. Preaching his funeral sermon the rector of Yoxford, Suffolk, echoed what had earlier been said of Fairclough's illustrious father: &#145;it had been alone worth an act of comprehension, to have included this one so valuable man&#146; within the Church of England  (Parkhurst, 23).<br>
