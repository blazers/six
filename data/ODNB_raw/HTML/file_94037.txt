<span class="headword">Friedlander,  Albert Hoschander</span>  (1927&#150;2004), <span class="occ">rabbi and writer</span>, was born on 10 May 1927 in Berlin, the son of Alexander Friedlander, textile broker, and his wife, Salome. He had a twin brother, Charles, and a sister, Dorrit, born two years earlier. The date and place of his birth meant that he grew up in what soon became Nazi Germany, and this was to affect not only the course of his life, but his life's work. This was typified by his experience on 9 November 1938 during <i>Kristallnacht</i>, the Nazi pogrom against Jewish properties throughout Germany, when he saw his synagogue go up in flames, and he and his father had to spend the night walking the streets of Berlin so as to avoid arrest. His parents made arrangements to leave Germany as soon as possible, and in May 1939 they left with all three children on the last refugee boat to Cuba. From there they made their way to the United States, eventually settling in Vicksburg, Mississippi.<br>
<br>Friedlander attended Chicago University, where he graduated in philosophy in 1946, and then went on to study for the rabbinate at the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, Ohio, which was then the leading seminary within the Reform branch of Judaism. He was ordained in 1952 and became a congregational minister, first at the United Hebrew Congregation, Fort Smith, Arkansas (1952&#150;6), and then at Temple B'nai Brith, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania (1956&#150;61). By then he had already established a reputation for both a formidable intellect and an engaging personality, which was suited to a more academic environment and metropolitan life. In 1961 he therefore moved to New York, where he combined being religious counsellor to students at Columbia University, heading a newly founded Jewish centre at the Hamptons, and working for his PhD. On 9 July the same year, at West London Synagogue, he married Evelyn Philipp, a 21-year-old British music student. It was a long and happy union that produced three daughters, Ariel, Michal, and Noam.<br>
<br>One of Friedlander's teachers at the Hebrew Union College was Leo Baeck, who had become the leader of German Jewry in 1933 and, despite being sent to Theresienstadt concentration camp, had survived the war. Friedlander related strongly to Baeck's synthesis of German culture and Jewish scholarship, and in 1965 translated and edited his seminal work <span class="italic">This People Israel: the Meaning of Jewish Existence</span>. His admiration for Baeck later resulted in a biography, <span class="italic">Leo Baeck: Teacher of Theresienstadt</span> (1968). Without Friedlander, Baeck's life and teachings might not have reached such a wide English-speaking audience and influenced a new generation. Alongside his academic work he was also actively engaged in social concerns, especially the struggle for civil rights, and marched with Martin Luther King.<br>
<br>In 1966 Friedlander moved to England where he took up the pulpit of Wembley Liberal Synagogue in Middlesex. His suburban congregational duties were supplemented by lecturing in Jewish history at the Leo Baeck College, London, which trained applicants for the Progressive (Reform and Liberal) rabbinate. His writing continued with <span class="italic">Out of the Whirlwind: Literature of the Holocaust</span> (1968), which helped Jews and non-Jews alike to face issues that had largely been suppressed after the war, but which were now beginning to resurface. It was part of an international debate that benefited enormously from his calm and systematic approach.<br>
<br>In 1971 Friedlander was chosen by Harold Reinhart to succeed him as minister of Westminster Synagogue, an independent Reform congregation, and was also appointed director of the Leo Baeck College. His long-standing interest in inter-faith work blossomed in the liberal climate that developed in the Christian world following the Second Vatican Council. He became renowned for his patient attempts to formulate a response to mass suffering and seek meaning in religious life after Auschwitz. Such was his reputation, especially as a post-holocaust theologian who was not only a fine teacher but also a living example of reconciliation, that he was in constant demand in both the United States and Europe as a lecturer. His teachings were particularly valued in Germany, where he became a regular speaker at the protestant church congresses, the <i>Kirchentage</i>. His approach to the holocaust was a theme that dominated further publications, including <span class="italic">The Six Days of Destruction</span> (1988), which he co-wrote with Elie Wiesel, <span class="italic">A Thread of Gold</span> (1990), which argued the case for reconciliation, and <span class="italic">Riders Towards the Dawn</span> (1993), which traced a religious journey from ultimate suffering to tempered hope. At the same time he was editor of <span class="italic">European Judaism</span> (1982&#150;2004), the foremost Jewish intellectual journal in Europe.<br>
<br>In 1982 Friedlander retired as director of the Leo Baeck College but retained a role as dean. He retired from Westminster Synagogue in 1997 but still played a part in its affairs as rabbi emeritus. His retirement did not involve any lessening of pace in a life full of writing articles, travelling for speaking engagements, as well as more mundane pursuits such as his lifelong devotion to Queens Park Rangers football club. He was renowned for his personal kindness and his desire to find harmonious solutions to any problems, whether between institutions or individuals. In 1993 he received Germany's highest honour, the cross of merit, for his work in promoting inter-faith dialogue. He was appointed OBE in 2001. Two years later the Council of Christians and Jews decided that, in addition to its then sole Jewish president, who was always the chief rabbi, an additional president should be appointed to represent the Progressive synagogues in Britain. A public figure who also commanded wide communal respect, Friedlander was the natural choice. He died at the Royal Brompton Hospital, Chelsea, on 8 July 2004, of multiple causes. He was cremated at Golders Green crematorium and his ashes were interred there. He was survived by his wife, Evelyn, and their three daughters, one of them a rabbi in the United States.<br>
