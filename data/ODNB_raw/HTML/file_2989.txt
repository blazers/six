<span class="headword">Bousser <span class="st"> [Bourchier]</span>, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1329/30), <span class="occ">justice</span>, is first mentioned as deputed by Robert de Vere, earl of Oxford, to represent him in the parliament summoned in 1306. In 1312 he was permitted to postpone the assumption of the rank of knight for three years in consideration of paying a fine of 100<i>s</i>. From at least January 1315 he acted as justice of assize in Kent, Surrey, and Sussex, and subsequently in other southern and East Anglian counties. While most of his judicial work remained centred on the south-east of England, the range of his activities increased. From 1316 he participated in Newgate gaol deliveries and he headed many commissions there between 1323 and 1329. He was also entrusted with gaol deliveries at Hertford (1317, 1323&#150;6, 1329) and Colchester Castle (1317&#150;20, 1323&#150;5), and with special commissions at Bury St Edmunds (1319), Dorchester (1321), and Rayleigh (1326). His extensive engagement in commissions of oyer and terminer from 1316 onwards focused on the same region. Bousser was keeper of the peace in Essex in 1317 and 1319/20 and in Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, and Lincolnshire in 1326. His other tasks included the investigation of abuses committed by purveyors (Kent, Surrey, Sussex, 1317); the alleged corruption of royal officials in the same counties (1318, 1323), in Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire (1321), and in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire (1326); allegations against tax collectors in Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire (1320), and Suffolk (1326); and complaints against commissioners of array in Essex, Hertfordshire, Middlesex (1323), and Suffolk, as well as against the keepers of the gaols in London (1326). These and similar tasks did not diminish with his appointment as justice of the common bench on 31 May 1321. Earlier in the same month he was among the thirty-eight judges summoned to attend parliament at Westminster. Already in 1319 he was involved in sensitive business, examining the record and process of a case relating to property in London, where in the following year he was openly accused of partiality by Simon Cofferer, the defendant in another case heard by him. In 1323 he investigated proceedings in the London husting and reviewed a judgment of the London sheriffs' court in the following year.<br>
<br>While Bousser maintained his connections with the de Vere family, he had clearly become a political supporter of the Despensers by 1322, investigating attacks on their possessions in Cambridgeshire and Wales and opening trespass proceedings against Roger Mortimer and others. In addition he appears to have acted as a Despenser agent in their attempts to acquire properties in Gower, Kent, and Worcestershire. In May 1323 he was summoned to attend parliament at York and in October opened an investigation into reports of miracles in Bristol at the place of Henry Montfort's and Henry Wylyngton's execution. In the remaining years of the reign he dealt with confiscated goods of insurgents and was appointed justice of oyer and terminer to investigate complaints made by the Despensers. After Edward II's fall he was summoned to attend a council meeting at Westminster in December 1326. He succeeded in regaining his former position; he took an oath in the London Guildhall to safeguard Queen Isabella and her eldest son in January 1327, acted as justice of oyer and terminer together with Roger Mortimer in Wales in the following month, and was reappointed justice of the common pleas in March.<br>
<br>In 1302 Bousser obtained the manor of Edwardstone in Suffolk for life, and by marriage to Helen, daughter and heir of Walter of Colchester, he acquired the manor of Stanstead. The centre of his properties was in and around Halstead in Essex, where his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2992/', "Robert Bourchier")</script> held the view of frankpledge after his father's death. Robert became chancellor in 1340 and a younger son, John, was rector of Sible Hedingham. Bousser remained active on the bench until Ascension day 1329 and may have died as early as July of that year; he was certainly dead by October 1330.<br>
