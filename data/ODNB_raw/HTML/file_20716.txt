<span class="headword">Eilmer</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>985, <em>d.</em> after 1066), <span class="occ">pioneer of man-powered flight</span>, was probably born in the 980s, dying not long after 1066. He was a monk of Malmesbury and all that is known of him is told by his fellow-monk William of Malmesbury, writing <i>c</i>.1125 in his <span class="italic">De gestis regum Anglorum</span>. There is no reason to doubt the substantial accuracy of the story, probably derived directly from Eilmer, whom Malmesbury could just have known as a very old man. When Halley's comet appeared in 1066, &#145;portending (as they say) a change in governments&#146;, Eilmer, by then advanced in years, crouched in terror and declared &#145;You've come, have you? &hellip; You've come, you source of tears to many mothers. It is long since I saw you; but as I see you now you are much more terrible, for I see you brandishing the downfall of my country&#146;  (Malmesbury, chap. 225). Malmesbury tells us that in his youth Eilmer had believed the fable of Daedalus and, seeking to imitate him, fixed wings to his hands and feet. Casting off from the top of a tower, he caught a breeze and flew for &#145;a stade and more&#146;. Conscious of his own temerity, and buffeted by the wind, he fell, crippling his legs and remaining thereafter an invalid. He himself attributed his fall to his forgetting to fit a tail.<br>
<br>Eilmer seems to have spent nearly all of his long life as a monk, and was and is distinguished only by his attempt at unpowered flight. This probably took place at some time between 1000 and 1010, assuming that he was about five years old when he saw Halley's comet for the first time in 989. Nor was it wholly unsuccessful. The distance travelled, &#145;a stade or more&#146;, corresponds to about 600 feet, or 200 metres, assuming that Malmesbury had in mind the Roman <i>stadium</i> of 606 feet 9 inches. It is true that the use of flexible wings requires a tail to act as a rudder, and that its absence undoubtedly contributed to Eilmer's crash landing. Curiously, a similar attempt had been made a century earlier, within western Europe but in a quite different cultural context. The fourteenth-century writer al-Makkari tells of the late ninth-century Cordovan Abu'l-Qasim Abbas ibn Firnas who tried to fly, using similar methods to Eilmer's with similar results. He hurt his back badly, for &#145;not knowing that birds when they alight come down upon their tails, he forgot to provide himself with one&#146;  (al-Makkari, 1.148). Perhaps Eilmer got the idea for his attempt from news of the earlier one.<br>
<br>This particular story of Malmesbury's had a long and independent afterlife: it was quoted by medieval chroniclers and encyclopaedists, and by early modern proponents of man-powered flight. Lynn White has noted the testimonia of Helinand of Froidmont, Alberic of Trois-Fontaines, Vincent of Beauvais, Roger Bacon, Ranulf Higden (who first misnamed the aviator &#145;Oliver&#146;) and the English translators of his work, Henry Knighton, John Nauclerus of T&uuml;bingen (<i>c</i>.1500), John Wilkins (1648), John Milton (1670), and John Wise (1850). Malmesbury referred to Eilmer as a good scholar for his times, which suggests that he may have been a writer, and there is a slender possibility that works ascribed to him survived until the sixteenth century. John Bale credited him with three works which are certainly of a sort that one might associate with a serious imitator of Daedalus, but are no longer known to exist.<br>
