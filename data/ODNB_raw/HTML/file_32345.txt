<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chalmers, Sir  Mackenzie Dalzell</span>  (1847&#150;1927), <span class="occ">judge and civil servant</span>, was born on 7 February 1847 at Nonington, near Barham, Kent, the second son of the Revd Frederick Skene Courtenay Chalmers, rector of Nonington and his wife, Matilda, daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18116/', "Revd William Marsh")</script>, honorary canon of Worcester Cathedral and perpetual curate of St Mary's, Leamington Spa. He was educated at King's College, London. His studies at Trinity College, Oxford, led to honours (second class) in the classical moderations in 1866, though he graduated in 1868 with only a pass degree. His connection with the college continued long after; indeed, in February 1907 some fellows approached him with a suggestion that he might succeed Professor H. F. Pelham as president of the college, though in the event nothing came of this. He made generous provision for the college in his will, leaving it the residue of his considerable personal estate, as well as his books and certain of his papers.<br>
<br>After his call to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1869 and a short period as a member of the Indian Civil Service, Chalmers returned to London in 1872, joining the home circuit and taking chambers at 1 Paper Buildings. In 1875 he moved to the chambers of Farrer Herschell QC at 3 Harcourt Buildings. In 1880 he was appointed a revising barrister, and he followed Herschell in 1881 in a move to 11 New Court, Carey Street.<br>
<br>In 1882, through Herschell's influence, Chalmers was appointed as standing counsel to the Board of Trade. As such he did much work on the reforming bill which became the <span class="roman">Bankruptcy Act 1883</span>. About this time he also wrote <span class="italic">The Cost of Litigation</span> (1880), <span class="italic">Local Government</span> (1883), and, with E. Hough, <span class="italic">The Bankruptcy Act 1883</span> (1884).<br>
<br>In 1884 Chalmers became a county court judge at Birmingham, an office he held until 1896, apart from a short period in 1893 as acting chief justice of Gibraltar. In 1898 Herschell, then in his final year as lord chancellor, appointed Chalmers a commissioner of assize. His failure to promote him further, as it was said that he wished, may have been only through lack of opportunity, though transition from the county court bench to the High Court bench would then have been unprecedented. (Herschell's sole appointment to the Queen's Bench Division was in 1892, and went to William Rann Kennedy.)<br>
<br>In 1878 Chalmers published <span class="italic">A Digest of the Law of Bills of Exchange</span>, a work of considerable scholarship. Written as a step on the way to a codification of the area, it was cast in the form of numbered propositions with added notes, much as if it were an act and a commentary on that act. After presenting a paper on this intended codification to the Institute of Bankers in 1880, he was instructed by the institute and by the associated chambers of commerce to draft a bill. This bill rapidly became the <span class="roman">Bills of Exchange Act</span> of 1882. As well as the <span class="italic">Digest</span>, Chalmers wrote <span class="italic">The Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 (India)</span> (1882) and the briefer <span class="italic">The Bills of Exchange Act 1882</span> (1882). His next substantial task was the codification of the law of sale of goods. He produced a draft bill in 1888, &#145;an acknowledged masterpiece of draftsmanship&#146;  (R. F. V. Henston, <span class="italic">Lives of the Lord Chancellors</span>, 1984, 108) which Herschell introduced to the House of Lords with the express purpose of eliciting criticisms, and in 1890 Chalmers published a text, <span class="italic">The Sale of Goods</span>. The bill was reintroduced to the house in 1891, and referred to a select committee of law lords. A proposal that the bill be extended to Scotland necessitated considerable delay, but it was eventually enacted as the <span class="roman">Sale of Goods Act</span> of 1893.<br>
<br>Marine insurance then claimed Chalmers's attention. In 1894 he produced a draft bill, which was introduced in the Lords and subjected to lengthy consideration in committee. In 1900 it was reintroduced, again considered in committee, and eventually passed by the Lords, but rejected by the Commons. In 1901 he produced (with Douglas Owen) <span class="italic">A Digest of the Law of Marine Insurance</span>. The Commons reconsidered the bill in 1906, when Lord Chancellor Loreburn's intervention secured its passage as the <span class="roman">Marine Insurance Act</span> of 1906.<br>
<br>Chalmers returned to India in 1896 as the legal member of the viceroy's council. His work included revisions to the code of criminal procedure, and an act aimed at legal touting. He was made a CSI in 1898. On his return to England in 1899 he was appointed assistant parliamentary counsel, in 1902 succeeding Courtenay Ilbert as first parliamentary counsel. In September 1903 he succeeded Sir Kenelm Digby as permanent under-secretary of state for the Home department. Here he handled petitions for clemency, in consultation with Lord Halsbury: together, they constituted a <i>de facto</i> criminal court of appeal prior to the formal constitution of this body in 1907. Chalmers was also on the standing committee for the revision of statute law: according to his <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist he enjoyed pruning obsolete laws, but was bored by factory and social legislation. The same memoir described him as &#145;A man of the world with a wide, if not perhaps very profound, knowledge of human nature, and untrammelled by any belief in its essential goodness or ultimate perfection&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 23 Dec 1927). He was made a CB in 1904, and created KCB in 1906. He retired in 1908.<br>
<br>In 1910 and 1912 Chalmers served as the British delegate at conferences at The Hague about the international unification of the law of bills of exchange. In 1911 he served as a member of the royal commission on Maltese affairs, and in 1916 of the royal commission on the Easter rising in Ireland. During the First World War he served on the war risks commission, and he was chairman of the commission which investigated German violations of the laws of war in Belgium. He was a member of the council of the Royal Aeronautical Society and vice-president of the London Fever Hospital, and he was keenly interested in the affairs of the order of St John of Jerusalem. The last three bodies were the recipients of considerable bequests in his will.<br>
<br>Chalmers never married. In his later years he lived at Wimbledon, and was almost daily at the Athenaeum, where he had many friends. He was also a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club. In December 1927 he underwent a serious operation, and died at a nursing home at 4 Dorset Square, Marylebone, London, on 22 December. He was buried at his birthplace, Nonington.<br>
