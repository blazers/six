<span class="headword">Ellis, Sir  Albert Fuller</span>  (1869&#150;1951), <span class="occ">mining engineer and phosphate commissioner in the south Pacific</span>, was born on 28 August 1869 in Roma, Queensland, the third son of George Coxon Ellis, a chemist, and his wife, Anne Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Izod. Three months later the family left Australia to farm in New Zealand, settling in the Waikato district. Ellis attended primary school there, and spent two years at Cambridge high school. Meanwhile his father had forsaken farming to work for John T. Arundel, a London company trading in the Pacific. Ellis's elder brothers joined their father at Arundels and, once he was eighteen, Ellis did likewise.<br>
<br>Ellis's first job was establishing coconut plantations in the Phoenix Islands but Arundels was involved in the guano trade as well as copra&#151;guano (bird and bat droppings) being a major source of phosphate, used as an agricultural fertilizer&#151;and Ellis, with an interest in chemistry acquired from his father, soon moved to phosphate analysis and management of phosphate workings on Baker and Howland islands. Following his temporary transfer to Sydney as an analyst his curiosity led to the discovery that was to make his the best-known name associated with the Pacific phosphate industry. An office doorstop, brought back from Nauru in 1896, was believed by colleagues to be a piece of petrified tree. In July 1899 Ellis's analysis revealed a 78 per cent content of phosphate of lime, a result that was to change not only his fortunes and those of the Pacific Islands Company, successor to Arundels, but the lives of Nauruans, Banabans, and Gilbert and Ellice islanders for the next hundred years. At the time a 30 per cent assay of phosphate of lime was typical of the guano islands and the trade was close to collapse because farmers wanted 60 per cent.<br>
<br>Nauru was then under German jurisdiction from the Marshall Islands; mining rights were held by Jaluit Gesellschaft. One hundred and sixty miles to the east, Banaba, known to geographers as Ocean Island and outside German jurisdiction, resembled Nauru. Ellis joined a trading voyage calling at both islands, collecting samples unobtrusively, while action began to secure prospecting rights in Nauru and to persuade Britain to annex Ocean Island. Ellis saw his prospects brightening and on a visit to New Zealand to meet customers married Florence Christina (Flo) Stewart (1875&#150;1909), daughter of Andrew Stewart, in Auckland on 31 January 1900. Ellis arrived at Ocean Island on 3 May and lost no time not only in determining that the deposits were very valuable but in making an agreement with the person he mistakenly believed to be the &#145;king&#146; to extract phosphate at the rate of &pound;50 a year for 999 years. The agreement, later notorious, was dated 3 May 1900. In fairness to Ellis, &pound;50 was the standard rental paid to the imperial government for guano islands and imperial history has worse examples of exploitation.<br>
<br>Ellis remained on Ocean Island, formally annexed to the crown on 26 September 1901, as mining manager, the company changing its name again to the Pacific Phosphate Company in 1902. When rights were secured he began mining also in Nauru in 1907. The phosphate-rich deposits in both islands were the result of ancient marine sedimentation, not of bird droppings as in the other phosphate islands. Their extraction required mining engineering skills much in advance of the brooms and wheelbarrows used to sweep up guano. Their scale required purpose-built ships and moorings at great depth. Technically and financially the enterprise soon outgrew Ellis, who was without formal qualification. Although Florence had joined him on Ocean Island and given birth in 1903 to a daughter, Joan, she never enjoyed good health and lost another baby, who might have survived had appropriate treatment been available. Florence died there in 1909 and in 1911 Ellis gladly assumed a newly created local directorship of the Pacific Phosphate Company, based in Auckland. There, on 19 February 1913, he married Nellie Isabel Stewart, sister of Florence. They had no children.<br>
<br>Dominion politics after the First World War and the impending Nauru mandate resulted in 1919 in the establishment of the three-power British Phosphate Commission, located in Melbourne. The commission bought the rights of the Pacific Phosphate Company and subsequently extended its operations to Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. Ellis represented New Zealand throughout the difficult years of negotiation. Appointed commissioner formally in 1920, Ellis held the position until his death, providing an unrivalled thread of continuity. He made use of the long sea voyages the job entailed to write several books about the history of the phosphate industry and the Pacific islands; these were published as <span class="italic">Ocean Island and Nauru: their Story</span> (1935), <span class="italic">Adventuring in Coral Seas</span> (1936), and <span class="italic">Mid-Pacific Outposts</span> (1946). As a phosphate commissioner his primary duty may have been to New Zealand farmers but his heart was in the phosphate islands and with their inhabitants, to whom he was deeply, if paternalistically, committed, and about whom he wrote with affection. A sincere evangelical Christian, he believed that the industry was to their advantage. He was a regular visitor to the islands and represented New Zealand at the surrender of the Japanese on both Nauru and Ocean Island at the end of the Second World War. Thus, although New Zealand was in many respects the junior partner, Ellis's experience and fair-mindedness gave him a pivotal role in disputes both between Britain and Australia and between the commissioners and their management, his achievements recognized by appointment as CMG in 1928 and a knighthood in 1938. Having lived latterly at Motirawa, 9 Argyle Street, Herne Bay, Auckland, he died in Auckland on 11 July 1951. To mark the sixtieth anniversary of Ellis's discovery of phosphate deposits a memorial to him was dedicated on Ocean Island in the presence of all three commissioners. The British Phosphate Commission was finally wound up in 1981.<br>
