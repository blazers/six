<span class="headword">Seymour,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1612, <em>d.</em> 1687), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was baptized on 13 August 1612, the second of the five sons of Sir Edward Seymour, second baronet (<i>c</i>.1580&#150;1659), of Berry Pomeroy, Devon, and his wife, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1643), daughter of Sir Henry Killigrew of Laroch, Cornwall. He was in his youth page of honour to Queen Henrietta Maria, and became a groom of the bedchamber to Prince Charles in May 1638. On the outbreak of the civil war he joined the royalist forces under his kinsman William Seymour, marquess of Hertford, and in September 1642 was the bearer of the challenge from him to the earl of Bedford. He carried the message from Prince Charles to the earl of Warwick in August 1648 summoning him to surrender the parliament's fleet. On 28 January 1649 he delivered the prince's last letter to his father, and received the king's final message to his son and his letter of farewell to Henrietta Maria. In October 1649, as &#145;a person unbyassed with any faction, and in whose discretion and integrity the king had great confidence&#146;  (Carte, 1.337), he was sent by Charles II from Jersey to the marquess of Ormond in Ireland to assess the military situation there. He accompanied Charles to Scotland in 1650, was voted away from the king's person by the Scottish committee, and left for France after the defeat at Dunbar, and the collapse of a plan for a royalist rising by the marquess of Huntly in October. In December 1650 Charles commissioned him to go in search of his brother James, who was then in Brussels, and endeavour to persuade him to return to Paris and follow his mother's advice. In 1651 Seymour was in Paris, and in the following years he undertook several hazardous missions to and from the king and his supporters in England, collecting and distributing money&#151;including the sum of &pound;215 &#145;for redeeming your majesty's seal&#146;  (Macray, 2.361)&#151;and transmitting advice and instructions. In October 1652 he had to defend himself before the council of state against the allegation that he was employed by the king. He went back and forth between Paris and the English royalists in 1653 and 1654, and in June 1654 he was arrested and sent to the Tower in the aftermath of the Gerard plot. He was arrested again, &#145;on suspicion of plotting to stir up forces against Government&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1655</i>, 204, 588), in June 1655. Freed from the Tower on bail in April 1656, he was rearrested in October, and having petitioned for release in February 1657 he finally obtained it &#145;upon hard terms&#146;  (Macray, 3.303) at the end of May.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1660 Seymour was elected an MP for East Looe, in Cornwall, which he represented until 1681. In the Convention he was instrumental in securing the exemption of Colonel Matthew Tomlinson from the list of those who were to be denied the benefit of the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity and Oblivion</span>, testifying that in the course of his last interview with Charles I the king had &#145;signified to him his pleasure, that the colonel should receive favour on account of his civil carriage to him, during his confinement&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow</span>, 2.286). In the Cavalier Parliament he was generally reckoned to be a supporter, as he was a dependant, of the court. He was not a conspicuously active member, but he seems to have been a mettlesome one. He was narrowly prevented from fighting a duel with Lord St John in 1665; and in 1669 he fought and wounded Roger Vaughan MP. In addition to his post as groom of the bedchamber, which he retained until Charles II's death, he was comptroller of customs in the port of London (1660&#150;69), and clerk of the hanaper (1661&#150;87). He was also granted a number of leases&#151;to the value, it was, most improbably, alleged, of &pound;40,000  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 4, appx, xxiv)&#151;in the duchy of Cornwall. In 1666 he took up residence at Langley, in Langley Marish, Buckinghamshire, which estate he bought from the trustees of Sir William Parsons in 1669, and where he lived until his death. He married first, about 1661, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1671), daughter of Sir Joseph Killigrew, and widow of William Bassett of Claverton, Somerset; she died in 1671. His second marriage, about 1672, was to Ursula, daughter of Sir Robert Austen, first baronet, of Bexley, Kent, and widow of George Stowell, of Cothelstone, Somerset; they had a daughter and a son, Henry, who was created a baronet at seven years of age (4 July 1681) in consideration of his father's services to his sovereign. Seymour died at Langley on 9 March 1687 and was buried there.<br>
