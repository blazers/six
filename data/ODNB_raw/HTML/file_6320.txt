<span class="headword">Cormack, Sir  John Rose</span>  (1815&#150;1882), <span class="occ">medical editor and physician</span>, was born on 1 March 1815 at Stow, Midlothian, the only son of the Revd John Cormack (1776&#150;1840), minister in the Church of Scotland, and his wife, Helen Rose, youngest daughter of John Rose, of Holm, Nairnshire. He attended the grammar school at Jedburgh before entering Edinburgh University in 1829 to study classics, mathematics, and philosophy. Cormack did not take his MA but stayed on to study medicine. In 1836 he won the university's Harveian prize for his &#145;Treatise on the properties of creosote&#146;. He graduated MD in 1837, receiving a gold medal for a thesis on the presence of air in the organs of circulation. In the same year he was senior president of the Edinburgh Royal Medical Society, in which capacity he presided over its centenary celebrations. After graduating Cormack visited Paris, where he attended some medical lectures, before travelling in Spain and Italy.<br>
<br>Cormack then returned to Edinburgh to practise medicine. He was appointed physician to the Royal Public Dispensary, to the Fever Hospital, and to the Royal Infirmary. He became FRCPE in 1841. On 4 November 1841 he was married in London, at St George's, Bloomsbury, to Eliza Anne, second daughter of William Hine, of Hampshire, Trelawney, Jamaica. They were to have four sons and seven daughters. Refused permission to give clinical lectures at the infirmary, Cormack resigned his post in 1845 and moved to Putney in south-west London, where he set up in practice as a general practitioner. In the 1850s he moved to central London. Although &#145;an amiable man of enterprising and industrious disposition&#146;, Cormack had limited success as a practitioner. A colleague, Charles Williams, attributed this to a lack of &#145;firmness and strength of character&#146;  (Williams, 411).<br>
<br>Cormack became a medical editor and author at a comparatively young age. In January 1841 he founded the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Monthly Journal of Medical Science</span>, which he edited until June 1846. In 1843 he wrote <span class="italic">The natural history, pathology, and treatment of the epidemic fever prevailing in Edinburgh and other towns</span>, and in 1848 he published a pamphlet on the <span class="roman">Universities of Scotland Bill</span>. In January of the following year he resumed his editorial activity, founding the <span class="italic">London Journal of Medicine</span>, which he edited until September 1852, at which point it was amalgamated with the <span class="italic">Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal (PMSJ)</span> to form the <span class="italic">Association Medical Journal</span> (<span class="italic">AMJ</span>&#151;the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> or <span class="italic">BMJ</span> from 1857). Cormack had been appointed to the part-time editorship of <span class="italic">PMSJ</span>, the weekly publication of the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association (PMSA&#151;the British Medical Association or BMA from 1855), in the previous August. He took up his editorial duties with the association at an annual salary of &pound;250, a sum he considered inadequate, in January 1853; he carried them out for a period of thirty-three months, tendering his resignation in August 1855.<br>
<br>Cormack was the first editor to produce the PMSA's journal in London, though he actually conducted most of his editorial work at his home, undertaking to be present at the journal office for no more than 75 minutes per week &#145;when not unavoidably prevented by other duties&#146;  (<span class="italic">AMJ</span>, 24 Nov 1852). In September 1854 he became <i>de facto</i> PMSA secretary. He was editor of the <span class="italic">AMJ</span> at a time when, through no fault of his, the association was riven with dissension about the journal's format, frequency and place of publication, high cost, and even its continued existence. Although Cormack's editorial regime was in many ways successful, he received much criticism, particularly from those PMSA members who resented the journal's transfer to London and its expansion to the point at which it threatened to become more important than the association which had established it. Matters came to a head at the PMSA's anniversary meeting at York in August 1855, when it was agreed that the editorship of the journal could not be held by the secretary of the association, and that the <span class="italic">AMJ</span> should revert to being the <span class="italic">PMSJ</span>. Despite having the support of many members, Cormack resigned both positions, though he remained a PMSA member. In 1856 he unsuccessfully applied to become medical officer of health for Holborn. Two years later he was also unsuccessful in an attempt to secure appointment as general medical registrar and secretary to the newly created General Medical Council.<br>
<br>In 1866 ill health prompted Cormack to move with his family to Orl&eacute;ans in France. In 1869, on the death of Sir Joseph Olliffe, physician to the British embassy, he then moved to Paris. He continued to write on medical subjects, though less prolifically than in the past. He translated volumes 2&#150;5 of Armand Trousseau's <span class="italic">Clinical Lectures</span> (1868), and published a two-volume collection of his main papers under the title <span class="italic">Clinical Studies</span> (1876). In August 1870 he was awarded the degree of MD in Paris with a thesis entitled: &#145;De l'entr&eacute;e de l'air dans les orifices b&eacute;ants des veines uterines consider&eacute;e comme cause de danger et de mort subite peu de temps apr&egrave;s la d&eacute;livrance&#146;. In reporting the award the <span class="italic">BMJ</span> stated that Cormack was the only physician in Paris to hold both British and French MD degrees.<br>
<br>Cormack was also in Paris when it was besieged during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870&#150;71 and throughout the commune. He served as surgeon to the Ambulance Anglaise, tending to the war wounded and to British residents of the city. In December 1870 he described in the <span class="italic">BMJ</span>, for which he was war correspondent, how the previous week was &#145;in many respects the most eventful, exciting, and laborious week of my whole life&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 17 Dec 1870, 664). In recognition of his work during the crises he received several awards. The French government made him chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1871, and in Britain, on 14 March 1872, he received a knighthood at Buckingham Palace. Cormack remained in Paris after the commune, becoming physician to the Hertford British Hospital, a post he retained for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>For some time before his death Cormack suffered from chronic disease of the prostate and bladder. In early 1882, in an attempt to recover his health, he spent several weeks in Monte Carlo, but on returning to Paris his condition deteriorated. He died at his home, 364 rue St Honor&eacute;, Paris, on 13 May 1882. His widow survived him by a few months.<br>
