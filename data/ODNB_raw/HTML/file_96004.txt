</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rotblat, Sir  Joseph</span>  (1908&#150;2005), <span class="occ">scientist and peace activist</span>, was born J&oacute;sef Rotblat on 4 November 1908 in Warsaw, the eldest of five surviving children (two others died in infancy) of Zygmunt, otherwise Zelman, Rotblat, the owner of a haulage company specializing in the paper trade, and his wife, Sonia, otherwise Schaindl, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Krajtman. Both parents were of Jewish descent. His earliest years were spent in some comfort, but the First World War brought ruin to his father's firm, as business slumped and horses were requisitioned for the armed forces, and the family slipped suddenly into poverty. Rotblat later recalled that at one point they were reduced to distilling and selling illegal vodka to get by.<h2>
<a name="Childhoodeducationandmarriage"></a>Childhood, education, and marriage</h2>Rotblat's childhood, he would later say, was &#145;a very unhappy one&#146;  (David Krieger, &#145;Joseph Rotblat and peace&#146;, in Braun and others, 43). At the age of twelve he was apprenticed to an electrician. One early job had him tearing up cobbles in Warsaw streets in the depths of winter to lay electrical cables. Though his parents had hopes that their thoughtful, intellectual eldest son would eventually become a rabbi he had other plans and, by studying at night, won a scholarship to the Free University of Poland to take a degree in physics.<br>
<br>After graduating with a master's degree in 1932 Rotblat landed a post as research assistant at the Radiological Laboratory of Warsaw, working under Ludwik Wertenstein. These were exciting times in physics, with a rush of discoveries about the nature of the atomic nucleus, and Rotblat was able to play a part. Though Wertenstein was a scientist of international reputation his laboratory was poorly resourced, and Rotblat's publications in the 1930s, mostly studies of nuclear bombardment, were a triumph over slender circumstances. One experiment involved a Geiger counter that he had to share with another scientist who worked on a different floor, so that at fixed intervals Rotblat would have to fling himself down two flights of stairs so as to take timely readings. In a paper from this period there was also a hint of the persuasiveness that was to become his hallmark, as he thanked the Bank of Poland for the loan of almost a kilogram of gold for use in an experiment.<br>
<br>Rotblat gained his PhD in 1938, by which time he was married to Tola Gryn, a young woman from Lublin whom he had met in 1930, when she was a student of Polish literature. He also had a new ambition: he wanted the Warsaw laboratory to have what was then the ultimate research tool in his field, a cyclotron, &#145;so we could start a proper school of nuclear physics&#146;  (Landau, 48). Cyclotrons accelerate subatomic particles to high speeds for use in experiments breaking down atomic nuclei. To gain the necessary experience Rotblat accepted an invitation to join a team that was building a cyclotron at Liverpool University, under James Chadwick. (He turned down an offer to work in Paris with Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Joliot-Curie, Marie Curie's son-in-law.) His Polish government bursary, however, would not support two people, so he left for England alone in early 1939, intending that Tola should join him as soon as he could afford it. Sure enough, his circumstances in Liverpool swiftly improved&#151;an impressed Chadwick found him a second bursary&#151;so that summer Rotblat returned to Warsaw to collect his wife. Just as they were to leave, however, she fell ill with appendicitis and again he left alone, expecting her to follow in days. Before she recovered the Germans invaded. All Rotblat's desperate efforts to get her out of Poland over the months that followed came to nothing.<h2>
<a name="TubeAlloys"></a>Tube Alloys</h2>These events in 1939 coincided with important developments in nuclear physics. First came the discovery of fission, a process by which very heavy radioactive elements can split when penetrated by neutrons, releasing large quantities of energy. Then came evidence (which Rotblat was one of the first to investigate) that each episode of fission was accompanied by the expulsion of stray neutrons. This raised the possibility of a fission chain reaction. While most physicists soon decided that a bomb exploiting this process remained impractical a few (again including Rotblat) were concerned enough to look further. It was two refugees working at Birmingham University, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who first identified a way of making such a bomb and alerted the British government. The result was a secret feasibility study under the codename Maud, followed by the launch of a research and development programme, codenamed Tube Alloys [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93791', "Tube Alloys directorate")</script>]. Rotblat, who by now was also lecturing at Liverpool, played an important role. Rated by Chadwick as &#145;an extremely able man, one of the best I have come across in years&#146;  (Brown, 187), he took effective charge of the Liverpool cyclotron, which was much in demand for Tube Alloys work. From the outset he had reservations about working on an atomic weapon, which he shared with Wertenstein in the summer of 1939, but such feelings were outweighed in his mind by the fear that Nazi Germany might develop such a bomb first.<br>
<br>During 1942 and 1943 the Manhattan project, the American nuclear weapon enterprise, grew so vast that Britain's Tube Alloys became little more than a junior partner with the task of supplying any expertise that could help. Thus in March 1944 Rotblat was sent to Los Alamos, the secret weapons laboratory in the New Mexico mountains&#151;though before going he displayed another of his lifelong characteristics, stubbornness, by refusing to swap his Polish nationality for British to please his American hosts. Los Alamos left a profound mark on him, even though, unlike some of his British colleagues, he made no important contribution to the weapon. He befriended Niels Bohr, the Danish philosopher&#150;physicist who was an adviser at Los Alamos, and their conversations stirred in him an anxiety about a future world with atomic weapons, and the risks of an arms race with the Soviet Union and wholesale destruction. Such fears deepened, he wrote much later, when he heard a senior American military official say: &#145;You realise, of course, that the real purpose of making the bomb is to subdue our chief enemy, the Russians&#146;  (Szasz, 57).<br>
<br>A pivotal moment in Rotblat's life came in the autumn of 1944 when the allies learned that Germany had made only rudimentary progress in nuclear research and did not have a bomb. With this news, he wrote forty years later, &#145;the whole purpose of my being in Los Alamos ceased to be, and I asked for permission to leave and return to Britain&#146;  (&#145;Leaving the bomb project&#146;, 18). He concluded, in other words, that since neither Germany nor Japan posed a credible nuclear threat there was no moral justification for continuing work on the atomic bomb. No other scientist at Los Alamos took this stance, and the British authorities were embarrassed by his request, but he insisted on leaving. A moment of black farce ensued when American security staff suddenly produced a dossier of evidence suggesting that Rotblat wanted to return to Europe so that he could deliver atomic secrets to Moscow. This was founded on some lurid gossip related to unauthorized visits he had made to an Englishwoman who lived near Los Alamos. Rotblat was able to show that many details in the dossier were wrong, and explained that he had visited the woman at the request of a mutual friend in Britain because she was becoming deaf and needed support. With this the last objections to his leaving were withdrawn, though he was told that the record would show that the grounds for his departure were that he wished to return to Europe to look for his family. This factor, indeed, must have been in his mind: he had heard nothing from his wife or the rest of his relatives since 1939.<h2>
<a name="TheASAandStBartholomews"></a>The ASA and St Bartholomew's</h2>News of the atomic attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 reached Rotblat at Liverpool, where he had resumed his post. He was shocked: he had retained a hope that the weapon would not work, or that the Americans and British would scruple to use it against civilians. Free, finally, to make public his private anxieties, he joined the earliest calls in Britain for action to ensure that atomic weapons would never be used again. He urged fellow scientists to lead the way, favouring for a short time a moratorium on nuclear research. He joined efforts to harness scientific opinion through the Association of Scientific Workers but found the trade union's left-wing leanings divisive. Instead, in March 1946 he, along with Nevill Mott, Rudolf Peierls, Harrie Massey, and others set up the Atomic Scientists' Association (ASA), with the aims of informing the public about nuclear matters, advancing the case for international control of atomic energy, and influencing public policy. From the outset Rotblat was among its most dynamic activists and he took the lead in what proved to be its most notable public success, the Atom Train. This travelling exhibition toured Britain in 1947&#150;8, putting before the public an engaging scientific account of the economic and military potential of atomic energy. Many thousands visited it, attended the supporting talks and debates, and bought the literature, and it was no less notable as a triumph both of organization, in what were economically hard times, and of diplomacy, for the Labour government was suspicious of the venture.<br>
<br>Although the ASA would survive another decade, events soon pushed it to the margin as the attempt to create United Nations control of atomic energy failed, the cold war set in, Britain pressed ahead with its own nuclear weapons programme, and the Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb, in 1949. Rotblat remained active in the group, becoming its executive vice-president, and for all its frustrations the experience was to exert a strong influence on him. Through the ASA he forged international connections, not least with American counterparts at the <span class="italic">Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</span>, based in Chicago. He also learned some of the hazards of attempting to be publicly active in the sphere of policy and politically neutral at the same time, and he gained experience both in motivating scientists and keeping a voluntary group afloat. These lessons would prove useful.<br>
<br>Rotblat's personal and professional life underwent upheaval in these post-war years. Soon after his return to Liverpool from Los Alamos he heard from his family in Poland. Remarkably, his mother, two sisters, and one brother had survived, having gone into hiding in the countryside. (His father had died before the war.) His wife, Tola, however, was dead&#151;though there was no official record his family had learned that she died in Majdanek concentration camp, probably in 1942. Rotblat (who did not remarry) arranged for his surviving relatives to join him in Liverpool, in itself a feat of willpower, and in the process he finally abandoned Polish nationality and became a British subject. A few years later his remaining brother also made contact. He had fought the Germans as a partisan in Russia and remained in the Soviet Union after the war. Soon he too moved to England.<br>
<br>In 1949 Rotblat altered the direction of his scientific career by accepting the post of professor of medical physics at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. This was a controversial move: some physicists, including Chadwick, felt he was abandoning a brilliant, important career for one of doubtful scientific value, while some senior hospital staff were horrified at the appointment of an outsider with no medical track record. Rotblat, as ever fully knowing his own mind, was undeterred, and from his perspective the move had clear ethical advantages. Experience had shown that it was impossible to anticipate the future uses of research of the kind he had pursued since 1932, but in health physics he felt certain he could do lasting good. Moving to London, he bought the house at 8 Asmara Road in West Hampstead which was to be his home for the rest of his life, as well as a hub for the wider Rotblat family and the depository for an ever-growing personal archive of papers.<br>
<br>Rotblat remained at Bart's until retirement in 1976, a talented teacher fondly remembered by generations of students, a gifted manager of research groups, and a dynamic administrator. From 1960 to 1972 he was editor-in-chief of the journal <span class="italic">Physics in Medicine and Biology</span>, whose reputation he did much to establish, and he conducted sustained research of his own in the use of radiotherapy in cancer treatment. His principal scientific achievements in these years, however, arose from a programme of experiments conducted in partnership with Patricia Lindop on the effects of radiation on healthy mice, which shed important light on the risks of human exposure to radiation.<h2>
<a name="Pugwash"></a>Pugwash</h2>It was Rotblat's unusual mix of talents, experiences, and interests that placed him, in 1954&#150;5, in the position to make a set of deductions that caused international uproar. In 1954 Japanese fishermen on a boat called the <i>Lucky Dragon 5</i> were showered with fallout from an American thermonuclear test. Several became ill and one died six months later. Rotblat, through a Japanese contact, learned details of the contamination, which led him to the conclusion that this had been a new, three-stage, fission-fusion-fission weapon, and he saw that this design must multiply many times the amount of radioactivity produced. After some hesitation he published his findings, prompting public alarm and official fury in London and Washington. This, and the focus it placed on the radiation hazards of nuclear weapons tests, eventually led to the break-up of the ASA.<br>
<br>About this time Rotblat was approached by Bertrand Russell, who was alarmed at the nuclear arms race and at the dangers of fallout from tests, and conceived the idea of issuing an international appeal for action. Rotblat lent his support, guidance, and, it seems, organizational flair. The result was the &#145;Russell&#150;Einstein manifesto&#146; of July 1955, which bore the signatures of Russell, Albert Einstein, eight other Nobel prizewinners, and Rotblat. Mentioning the fate of the <i>Lucky Dragon</i>, it declared that the human race was in peril and called for an international congress of scientists to review the options and make recommendations. The initiative won widespread support and led to the birth, two years later (once the crises of Suez and Hungary had passed), of the Pugwash conferences on science and world affairs, named for the small town in Nova Scotia where the first meeting was held.<br>
<br>Pugwash became the great work of Rotblat's life. In 1997 he presided over a fortieth anniversary gathering at Lillehammer in Norway. By then there had been 229 meetings and workshops in forty countries, attended by 3360 people of more than 100 nationalities. Pugwash had a ruling council, offices, thirty-eight national groups, and an international student branch. Its reports were widely read, and had influence in the world's most important capitals. Yet it was hard to pin down&#151;a movement rather than an organization&#151;and almost unknown to the general public. The paradox was deliberate, owing something to Russell's inspiration and a great deal to Rotblat's vision and experience. He co-chaired the first meeting in Canada and served successively over those forty years as secretary-general (1957&#150;73), chairman of British Pugwash (1978&#150;88), and then president of Pugwash worldwide (1988&#150;97). He attended the great majority of meetings, often taking the chair, and by common consent was the guiding light and dynamo of the operation.<br>
<br>The mission of Pugwash was to bring together experts to seek ways of reducing the dangers to the world, initially from weapons of mass destruction and war but as time passed from such other threats as food and energy shortage and economic imbalance. Those who attended did so by invitation, and spoke only in a personal capacity. The spirit was of &#145;rational analysis and objective inquiry&#146;, and &#145;mutual trust and friendship&#146;  (Moore, 41&#150;2). Conclusions and recommendations were often communicated personally to those intended to receive them, without public declaration. On this basis Pugwash was consistently able to bring together leading experts from many countries, notably from both sides of the iron curtain, even in the coldest periods of the cold war. Inevitably this excited suspicion, and Pugwash was sometimes denounced as a puppet of one side or another, but the dialogue continued.<br>
<br>The influence of such a process is difficult to measure, but Pugwash has been credited with contributing ideas and impetus to the partial test ban treaty of 1963, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of 1968, the anti-ballistic missile treaty of 1972, the biological weapons convention of 1972, and the chemical weapons convention of 1993, as well as to longer-term East&#150;West nuclear arms reduction processes and European confidence-building measures. In addition it had other impacts, notably in providing East&#150;West channels of communication during the Cuban missile crisis and the Vietnam war. Mikhail Gorbachov, the last leader of the Soviet Union, said of Pugwash in 1990 that &#145;Through its activities, due to scientific and moral authority, Pugwash has contributed in a unique way to averting the military danger, has helped to stop the &#147;Cold War&#148; and to achieve profound positive changes in the development of the world&#146;  (J. Harris, &#145;Joseph Rotblat and Pugwash&#146;, in Braun and others, 11).<br>
<br>Rotblat was never alone in this work, but it was his extraordinary dynamism, charm, and single-mindedness that made it happen. A slim, handsome figure with old-world manners and a gentle, Polish accent even in old age, he had the gift of communicating easily with people of all kinds, and particularly with the young. He was also a brilliant, steely eyed committeeman and master of procedure, and he could be ruthless in the cause of peace. When an Israeli scientist late with a contribution to a Pugwash publication paid a social visit to Rotblat's office he found himself locked in a cellar until he finished the piece, with only the occasional bowl of soup passed in to sustain him. Rotblat's own energy was phenomenal. He wrote more than 300 books and articles and edited countless more, and he continued to write, lecture, and travel tirelessly even in his tenth decade. The story was told that some young men saw him rush past them at a London underground station and called out: &#145;What's the hurry, you're an old man!&#146;. He answered: &#145;Don't you see? It's because I'm an old man that I'm in a hurry&#146;  (T. Milne, &#145;Joseph Rotblat&#146;, in Braun and others, 209).<br>
<br>Behind Rotblat's frenetic activity lay a very powerful moral sense, the sense that caused him to walk out of Los Alamos in 1944, and that perhaps led his parents, years before that, to think that he had the makings of a rabbi. In adulthood he had no religion besides the cause of peace (he described himself as an agnostic rather than an atheist, since he could not be certain that God did not exist), and he saw his particular mission as one of reaching out to scientists and engaging them in that cause. Scientists, he felt, must accept responsibility for their discoveries and must participate fully in the debates about their use, because they were human beings first and scientists second. He liked to quote a phrase from the Russell&#150;Einstein manifesto: &#145;Remember your humanity&#146;.<br>
<br>For most of his post-war life Rotblat was a respected figure though not a well-known one, even in his adopted country; but recognition, honours, and a certain fame came in a rush in his final years. In 1995, the fiftieth anniversary of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he and Pugwash were jointly awarded the Nobel prize for peace (he donated every penny of his prize money to Pugwash) and in the same year he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. In 1998 he was knighted and&#151;a different sort of honour, but one he also relished&#151;invited to appear on BBC Radio 4's <span class="italic">Desert Island Discs</span> programme. In 2004 he suffered a minor stroke, which finally put a stop to his travels, and his health declined from then until his death at the Royal Free Hospital, Camden, on 31 August 2005, of septicaemia. He outlived his siblings but two nieces survived him.<br>
