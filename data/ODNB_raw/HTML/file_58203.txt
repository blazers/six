<span class="headword">Heal, Sir  Ambrose</span>  (1872&#150;1959), <span class="occ">shopkeeper and furniture designer</span>, was born on 3 September 1872 at Crouch End, London, the eldest child of Ambrose Heal (1847&#150;1913), bedding manufacturer and furnisher, and Emily Maria (1849&#150;1938), daughter of Thomas Stephenson of Finchley. Thus he was born into the family firm of Heal &amp; Son. His great-grandfather, John Harris Heal, started the business in London in 1810. His grandfather, also called John Harris Heal, made the Heals shop in Tottenham Court Road, London, famous for its beds and mattresses in the 1850s and 1860s; they began to sell general and bedroom furniture at this time. His father, a devout Anglican and a pillar of the local community, was a partner in the firm, and chairman from 1906 until his death in 1913. Ambrose Heal himself was educated at Marlborough College and, at some stage, at the Slade School of Fine Art, London. In 1890 he was apprenticed for two years to a cabinet-maker in Warwick with a view to entering the family firm, and he then worked for six months for Graham and Biddle, furnishers, of Oxford Street, London. He joined Heal &amp; Son in 1893 and was put to work in the bedding factory. But he had ideas beyond the technical excellence of mattresses. In the mid-1890s he began designing simple, sturdy pieces of furniture, often in plain oak. They looked out of place among the more conventional designs in Heals shop, and it is said the staff called them &#145;prison furniture&#146;  (Carrington, 36). They were more at home in the exhibitions of the arts and crafts movement, the progressive design movement of the day. But among arts and crafts people Tottenham Court Road was a byword for bad taste. Ambrose Heal, for his part, did not see why there should be a conflict between shopkeeping and good taste.<br>
<br>On 26 February 1895 Heal married Alice Rose Rippingille (1859&#150;1901), daughter of a Birmingham manufacturer. They settled in Pinner, Middlesex, where his father lived, and their only son, Cecil, was born in 1896. In 1900 Ambrose Heal senior built a house for his son and daughter-in-law next-door to his own. It was a modest, white-plastered family house designed by the arts and crafts architect Cecil Brewer, a cousin of the Heals. Named the Fives Court because Ambrose Heal junior enjoyed such active sports, it had a court incorporated in the plan. They moved into the house in March 1901, but Alice Heal was already ill with cancer and died two months later. Three years later, on 20 August 1904, Ambrose Heal married Edith Florence Digby Todhunter (1880&#150;1946), daughter of John Todhunter, the Irish playwright.<br>
<br>Heal was a founding member of the Design and Industries Association (DIA), set up in 1914&#150;15 by a group of architects, designers, shopkeepers, and manufacturers who wanted to bring some of the values of the arts and crafts movement to bear on industrial production, as the Germans had done in the pre-war years. The arts and crafts had been more or less anti-industrial. The DIA wanted a practical campaign for quality in the world of machine production: sound workmanship, the value of everyday things, fitness for purpose. Here was a philosophy for the progressive shopkeeper. The catch-all phrase was &#145;good design&#146;.<br>
<br>Heal was by this date in control of Heal &amp; Son. On the death of his father in 1913 he became chairman of the firm, a position which he held until 1953. He was a skilful furniture designer, and a collector, but his reputation rests mainly on forty years of discriminating shopkeeping, on his particular mixture of DIA convictions, personal tastes, and opportunism. Beds and mattresses remained the staple of the shop, as in his father's and grandfather's time. (It was Ambrose Heal who designed the shop's well-known four-poster trade mark.) But now Heals began to sell ceramics, glass, and textiles; he shopped in Germany for pots, peasant rugs, and wooden toys. A new shop was built in 1913&#150;16 to Cecil Brewer's designs: an island of architectural quality in Tottenham Court Road. There was an art gallery at the top of this building, showing works by Picasso, Wyndham Lewis, and Modigliani: modern art in a furniture store. Most Heals furniture was simplified, late arts and crafts, but when the shifts of fashion required, the firm could turn to tubular steel or versions of art deco. Such artists as Edward McKnight Kauffer and Claud Lovat Fraser designed Heals posters, and Noel Carrington and John Gloag (both critics and DIA members) wrote persuasive, understated essays in Heals catalogues. The effect was cumulative: looking back on the 1930s, Sir Hugh Casson wrote that &#145;Heal's was a symbol rather than a shop&#146;  (Goodden, 1). In 1933, aged sixty-one, Ambrose Heal was knighted for raising standards of design. Six years later he was appointed a royal designer for industry.<br>
<br>It is not clear how much at Heals was Ambrose Heal's own work and how much that of his senior staff&#151;of Prudence Maufe who ran the Mansard Gallery; of his right-hand man Hamilton Smith, another DIA stalwart; or of the two designers J. F. Johnson and Arthur Greenwood. It was probably largely his, for he kept a tight control over all departments. With his fluffy red-gold hair and high, slightly condescending voice, he could be seen and heard everywhere on the premises, inspiring respect and fear. Heal had, in effect, made a marketable commodity out of his own tastes and convictions, as did Terence Conran later at Habitat.<br>
<br>In 1917 the Heal family moved to Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire. The eldest boy, Cecil, had been killed in the war, and Ambrose's and Edith's first child had died in infancy. But there were now three children, <a href="#cosubject_58203">Anthony (1907&#150;1995) [<i>see below</i>]</a>, Pamela (<i>b</i>. 1908), and Christopher (<i>b</i>. 1911). In 1919 they moved into Baylin's Farm just outside Beaconsfield, a rambling, part-medieval brick farmhouse enlarged for them by Forbes and Tate. Like the Fives Court, this was a domestic haven and a rural retreat&#151;Edith Heal was a keen gardener&#151;but Ambrose Heal was there only at weekends. During the week he stayed in a flat in Fitzroy Square, an arrangement that made his love affairs simpler. Prudence Maufe was his mistress in the early 1920s, and in the late 1920s, oddly seductive with her bobbed hair, Dodie Smith, who bought prints for Heals and later wrote <span class="italic">101 Dalmatians</span>. His affairs did not, he told her, threaten his family life.<br>
<br>There was a scholarly, acquisitive side to Heal. He made an important collection of eighteenth-century London tradesmen's cards which he bequeathed to the British Museum, and in his later years he compiled long lists of the names, addresses, and visual records of tradesmen, mainly from seventeenth- and eighteenth-century London. These were published as <span class="italic">London Tradesmen's Cards of the Eighteenth Century</span> (1925), <span class="italic">The English Writing Masters and their Copy Books, 1570&#150;1800</span> (1931), <span class="italic">The London Goldsmiths, 1200&#150;1800</span> (1935), <span class="italic">The Signboards of Old London Shops</span> (1947), and <span class="italic">The London Furniture Makers from the Restoration to the Victorian Era, 1660&#150;1840</span> (1953). These books are invaluable for researchers. For Heal they perhaps expressed an ambivalence about the past. On the one hand, they created a tradition in which his own work could be seen and valued. On the other, they registered a loss&#151;for, during his lifetime or before, many of these trades had ceased to be important in London's economy.<br>
<br>In the late 1930s Heal began to relax his hold on the firm. His elder surviving son became managing director in 1936. In 1937 he thought of retiring to Bath. But the war came before this move could be made, and he stayed on as chairman. Edith Heal died in 1946, and Ambrose Heal resigned as chairman in 1953. He had worked at Heal &amp; Son for sixty years, and in his last few years at Baylin's Farm he seemed lost. He died at Beaconsfield on 15 November 1959, and was buried on 19 November in Holy Trinity churchyard at Penn near by, next to his wife. His obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (17 Nov 1959) described him as &#145;one of the great artists and craftsmen of his time&#146;. This was very wide of the mark, but it showed what a powerful image he had created for his shop, and thus for himself. Most writing about him since his death has had the reverent tone of company hagiography, and he remains, like his friend and fellow furniture designer Gordon Russell, wrapped in the mythology of &#145;good design&#146;. He deserves an independent study.<br>
<br>Heal's elder surviving son by his second marriage, <a name="cosubject_58203"></a><span class="headword">Anthony Standerwick Heal</span>  (1907&#150;1995), <span class="occ">shopkeeper and businessman</span>, was born on 23 February 1907 and educated at the Quaker School, Leighton Park, Reading (1919&#150;25), Grenoble University (1925&#150;6), and the M&uuml;nchener Lehrwerkst&auml;tten, Munich (1926&#150;7). He then served an apprenticeship at the Gordon Russell furniture workshops in Broadway, Worcestershire (1927&#150;9). In 1929 he joined the family firm and in 1936 became managing director. In 1941 he married Theodora Caldwell, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Griffin (<i>d</i>. 1992); they had two sons. During the war he served in the Home Guard. As chairman of Heals from 1953, he counted among his particular responsibilities advertising and promotions. His interests in china, glass, and fabrics helped to diversify the stock, and he introduced &#145;his-and-hers&#146; four-poster beds. He was much concerned with technical education in the furniture industry, and he served as master of the Furniture Makers' Guild (1959&#150;60), president of the Design and Industries Association (1965), and chairman of the Independent Stores Association (1970&#150;72), and was on the council of the City and Guilds of London Institute (1969&#150;81). However, the firm suffered from fashion and market changes, and in 1983 it was bought by Terence Conran's Habitat&#150;Mothercare group. Heal continued his association for another year, working on the company archives, which were given to the Victoria and Albert Museum. He was an enthusiastic owner and racer of veteran and vintage sports cars, especially Sunbeams&#151;on which he published a definitive book in 1989&#151;and was a founder in 1934 and became captain in 1947 of the Vintage Sports Car Club. Also keen on traction engines, he bought a huge 1916 artillery tractor which he drove to rallies. A quiet, reserved man, Heal died on 25 March 1995. He was survived by his two sons.<br>
