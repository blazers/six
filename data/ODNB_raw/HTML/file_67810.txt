<span class="headword">Beeston <span class="st"> [Hutchinson]</span>,  William</span>  (1610/11?&#150;1682), <span class="occ">theatre impresario and actor</span>, was the son of the leading theatre manager <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66593/', "Christopher Beeston (1579/80&#150;1638)")</script> and his first wife, Jane Sands. Like his father, William sometimes appears in the records with the alternative surname of Hutchinson, and he seems to have inherited his family's Catholicism. William was presumably Jane's and Christopher's oldest surviving son, although he was not one of the three born in St Leonard, Shoreditch, between 1604 and 1610, when the family moved to Clerkenwell. It seems likely therefore that he was born in 1610 or 1611. In a lawsuit he described himself as &#145;bred up in the art of stage playing&#146;  (Bentley, 2.370), but nothing is known of his career before 1632, when he is noted in management with Richard Gunnell and William Blagrave at the Salisbury Court Theatre.<br>
<br>William Beeston joined his highly successful father in running the Cockpit Theatre in Drury Lane in 1636&#150;7, during a long closure because of the plague when companies, theatres, and loyalties all changed radically. During this period the two Beestons threw out the company that had run there for ten years and replaced them with a new company of mainly young players, who became known as Beeston's Boys. The older Beeston had been planning the change for some time. A privy council order of 12 May 1637 keeping the theatres closed names the responsible individuals at the Cockpit as &#145;Christopher and William Biston Theophilus Bird Ezech: Fenn &amp; Michael Moone&#146;, the latter three senior &#145;boy&#146; players  (<span class="italic">Malone Society Collections</span>, 1/5.392). Altogether there were at least twelve &#145;boys&#146; beside the adults in the company. When Christopher died in October 1638 William inherited a thriving and well-supported business. By his father's will he received half a share (out of six) in the company, and in April 1639 he was duly sworn in as &#145;Governour &amp; Instructer of the Kings and Queens young Company of Actors&#146;. Richard Brome, once a &#145;servant&#146; to Ben Jonson, wrote a note for the published text of <span class="italic">The Antipodes</span> in 1640, which he had offered to the Cockpit Theatre before contractual obligations forced him to have it staged at the Salisbury Court, giving a plug for &#145;my most deserving friend Mr William Beeston, unto whom it properly appertained&#146;  (Brome, 120).<br>
<br>The new company's plays included almost half of the cream of the time, rivalling those of the former Shakespeare company, the King's Men. They are known because of an order which forbade other companies to perform them issued by the lord chamberlain on the same day as his warrant for the players, 10 August 1639. It was prompted by William Beeston as &#145;governor&#146; of the company and appears to be the list of the best playbooks he had inherited from his father. Some of them date back to the beginning of the century. The forty-five titles, almost all extant, exemplify the tradition of writing for the stage that followed Shakespeare, Beaumont's <span class="italic">The Knight of the Burning Pestle</span>, Beaumont's and Fletcher's <span class="italic">Cupid's Revenge</span>, Massinger's <span class="italic">The Bondman</span> and <span class="italic">A New Way to Pay Old Debts</span>, Shirley's <span class="italic">The Young Admiral</span> and <span class="italic">Hyde Park</span>, Middleton's and Rowley's <span class="italic">The Changeling</span>, and Ford's <span class="italic">'Tis Pity she's a Whore</span>.<br>
<br>The younger Beeston proved rather less adroit than his father in managing company affairs in the four years before parliament in September 1642 banned the public staging of all plays. In May 1640 Beeston and two of his adult helpers were put in the Marshalsea for acting an unlicensed play. The master of the revels, official censor of plays, noted that:<blockquote>the play I calde for, and, forbiddinge the playeinge of it, keepe the booke, because it had relation to the passages of the K.s journey into the Northe, and was complayned of by his Majestye to mee, with commande to punishe the offenders. (Bawcutt, 208)</blockquote>It was the king who in 1639 ordered the lord chamberlain to name the plays belonging to Beeston, but his interest in playgoing made him alert to hostile allusions. This offence appears to have cost Beeston his managerial role, and in his place the master of the revels made William Davenant the company's new &#145;governor&#146;. Impresario control was still far from absolute, and government orders still largely directed what happened to the acting companies. An order dated 27 June 1640 told the Cockpit company that the lord chamberlain was giving control of the Beeston company to Davenant. Selling playgoing to the general public was not yet an entirely private enterprise: the government took over when the management stepped out of line.<br>
<br>Davenant had been in the job less than a year when his entanglement in the army plot put him in prison. Beeston once again became &#145;Governor of the Cockpitt Players&#146;  (Bentley, 2.373), but by then there was barely a year before the closure of the theatres. On 15 July 1642 Beeston married Alice Bowen (<i>d</i>. 1686) at St Giles-in-the-Fields (she was possibly not his first wife). A daughter was baptized in 1644 and they had at least two sons, George (who became an actor and died before his father) and Sackville. Through the years of closure Beeston remained in business of various kinds, evidently hoping that he could return to theatre work. He may have staged some of the surreptitious performances at Gibbons's Tennis Court and other places. In 1649 he tried to buy the empty Salisbury Court Theatre, a deal completed in 1652 for a lower price after it was damaged by a mob of soldiers and apprentices. In winter 1650 he started training a new boy company to play at the Cockpit, which he also tried to secure, unsuccessfully. There were various projects to revive theatre in the 1650s, but Beeston's name does not recur in them, apart from a recommendation by Richard Flecknoe, published at the end of <span class="italic">Love's Dominion</span> in 1654, that he would be the most suitable man to manage &#145;the REFORMED Stage&#146;, &#145;his long Practice and Experience in this way, as also for having brought up most of the Actors extant&#146;  (Bentley, 2.373&#150;4). But once again William Davenant intervened, and the first new stagings at the Cockpit in 1659 and 1660 were under his control, not Beeston's. Beeston did start a new company in 1660 at his other property, the Salisbury Court, and ran plays there until it burnt down in 1666. Subsequently he became an actor with the King's Company. Pepys saw him in 1668 in a comedy by Flecknoe, and the following year in <span class="italic">The Heiress</span>, a play part-authored by the duke of Newcastle. Beeston, standing in, had to read his part, &#145;and thereby spoils the part and almost the play, it being one of the best parts in it&#146;, though Pepys was amused by the sight of Beeston reading by candle-light in a scene meant to be in darkness  (Pepys, 9.436).<br>
<br>By then Beeston had other interests as property owner and property manager, and his name does not appear in further records of Restoration theatre management. In his later years, according to John Aubrey, &#145;he was not a company keeper; lived in Shoreditch; would not be debauched, and if invited to court, was in paine&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 1.97). Beeston's long career and long memory led Dryden to call him &#145;the chronicle of the stage&#146;, while he provided Aubrey with tales of Jonson and Shakespeare. He was charged with recusancy in 1680, like his mother before him. He died in 1682, about 24 August. He was then living in Bishopsgate Street in the parish of St Leonard, Shoreditch, and his will indicates that his estate consisted chiefly of properties including a &#145;house called the blacke Swanne&#146; and tenements in King's Head Yard. His widow, Alice, and son Sackville survived him, while his son George had left a &#145;reputed sonne&#146; Benaniah, whom William left to the care of his widow and who was to inherit the property in Shoreditch after her death  (Honigmann and Brock, 219).<br>
