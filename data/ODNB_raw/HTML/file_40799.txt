<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Egerton, Sir  Philip</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1698), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the fifth but second surviving son of Sir Rowland Egerton, first baronet (<i>d</i>. 1646), of Oulton, Cheshire, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68054/', "Bridget Egerton (d. 1648)")</script>, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11524/', "Arthur Grey, fourteenth Baron Grey of Wilton")</script>. Egerton inherited the Oulton estate on his father's death, while his elder brother, John, inherited the baronetcy and estates in Staffordshire and Northamptonshire. In 1656 he married Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1707), daughter and heir of Piers Conway of Hendre, Flintshire. They had seven children, two of whom survived to adulthood, John Egerton and Philip Egerton (<i>d</i>. 1726), rector of Astbury, Cheshire. During his career Egerton acquired more land for the estate; his business interests included (by 1685) the long-established ironworks at Tib Green, near Nantwich, Cheshire. Egerton's father had lent Charles I money at the start of the civil war, but later co-operated with parliament, which voted him thanks for bringing news of the surrender of Pontefract in 1645.<br>
<br>In 1659 Egerton's career took a decisively royalist path when he raised and equipped a troop of horse in Sir George Booth's rising in favour of Charles II, for which the king rewarded him with a knighthood on 23 June 1660. That April Egerton had become a captain of the militia horse, and from 1661 was a lieutenant-colonel; he took a part in investigating and suppressing any indications of rebellion as well as enforcing the penal laws against dissenters in Cheshire. Egerton stood as a country candidate at the 1670 by-election in Cheshire against Thomas Cholmondeley of Vale Royal, the court candidate, following unsuccessful negotiations among the gentry aimed at agreeing a single candidate. Cholmondeley had also taken part in Booth's rising and had been appointed sheriff of Cheshire at the Restoration. Egerton stood down after a three-day poll, conceding the election to Cholmondeley.<br>
<br>In 1673 Egerton was appointed deputy lieutenant of Cheshire when his relation John Egerton, second earl of Bridgewater, was appointed lord lieutenant. Egerton continued to serve as a deputy lieutenant following the appointment of William George Richard Stanley, ninth earl of Derby, as lord lieutenant of Cheshire in 1676.<br>
<br>Egerton did not run in the 1678 by-election, where Henry Booth was elected without opposition. Booth, like his father, Sir George Booth, by then first Baron Delamer, had become a vocal opponent of the government. In the elections for the first Exclusion Parliament in 1679, the Cheshire gentry met and agreed that Egerton and Booth would sit without opposition. Although Shaftesbury had listed Egerton as &#145;Honest&#146;, Egerton voted against the <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span> and was an active member sitting on fifteen committees, including the committees on the bills for protecting the country against popery and a bill which limited the importation of Irish cattle, which was very important to Cheshire.<br>
<br>It is not clear whether Egerton stood for the second Exclusion Parliament, but Sir Robert Cotton, an ally of Booth and a supporter of the <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span>, was returned in his place. In the 1681 election Robert Cholmondeley, first Viscount Cholmondeley, unsuccessfully tried to organize the Cheshire gentry to support Egerton and another court candidate, Sir Robert Leycester. He ordered that his cousin Francis Cholmondeley (the brother of Thomas, whose election Egerton had contested in 1670) make sure that Cholmondeley's tenants got out to vote. Egerton was described to the king as a &#145;very good man&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1680&#150;81</i>, 152). Both Egerton and Leycester were defeated. Lord Cholmondeley complained after the election that Booth and Cotton spent vast sums during the election. Booth in turn branded Egerton's supporters &#145;Papists&#146;, and noted with satisfaction that during the election Booth and Cotton had received respectively 1500 and 1200 votes while Leycester had about 340 and Egerton only 280 votes.<br>
<br>After Charles II dissolved the Oxford parliament his illegitimate son James Scott, duke of Monmouth, arranged a tour of the north-west. Egerton's rivals, such as Booth, organized demonstrations in favour of Monmouth. Egerton helped the government gather intelligence about these activities, and took part in competing &#145;loyal gentry meeting[s] at a hunting and other sports in the forest&#146;, with his son winning a &#145;tumbler&#146; at a foot-race  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1682</i>, 393).<br>
<br>The next major local contest was the mayoral election in Chester in 1682. One of Booth's allies, Colonel Roger Whitley, lost the race, and in response the &#145;mobile&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1682</i>, 471) rioted and broke out the windows of Egerton's new Chester house. In 1683, after the discovery of the Rye House plot, Egerton, in his role as deputy lieutenant, was active in the harassment of the local whig gentry, including searching their houses for allegedly concealed arms. Egerton also supported the replacement of the charter for the city of Chester. During the delivery of the new charter Egerton joined the mayor, Sir Thomas Grosvenor, and &#145;a great many other gentlemen&#146;  (Hughes, 41&#150;2) in a great celebration. Numerous whigs, such as the former mayor Whitley, were expressly excluded from being able to hold office under the new charter.<br>
<br>After James II's accession Egerton was again appointed deputy lieutenant for Cheshire, and stood as a court candidate at the hotly contested 1685 election. Booth had succeeded his father as second Baron Delamer, and the whigs advanced Booth's old ally, Sir Robert Cotton, together with John Mainwaring. Egerton was paired with his rival from the 1670 election, Thomas Cholmondeley (who was already or was to be the father-in-law of Egerton's oldest surviving son, John). Mainwaring's father in his diary complained bitterly that the sheriff manipulated the election by closing the poll early. Egerton and Cholmondeley were elected with 1966 and 2099 votes, compared to Mainwaring and Cotton getting 1682 and 1552. Egerton was again an active member of the Commons, where he served on eleven committees.<br>
<br>Egerton retained his militia command under James II, but it is not clear whether he was removed from his post as deputy lieutenant when Derby was removed in 1687. When Derby was restored to the lord lieutenancy of Cheshire, Egerton was either confirmed or reappointed by James on 3 November 1688.<br>
<br>Egerton did not sit in the Convention, and instead his 1685 rivals Sir Robert Cotton and John Mainwaring represented Cheshire. He became a nonjuror and in 1690 was imprisoned in Chester Castle as a Jacobite suspect. He was implicated in the 1694 &#145;Lancashire plot&#146; as being prepared to rise in support of James's restoration. He was not, however, tried for treason, and died at his home at Oulton, Cheshire, on 15 August 1698. He was buried at Little Budworth, Cheshire, and was survived by his wife and two sons. At her death in 1707, his wife left money to build a school at Oulton, which she endowed with &pound;21 per annum to support the education of eight children.<br>
