<span class="headword">Bullough,  John</span>  (1836/7&#150;1891), <span class="occ">textile machinery manufacturer</span>, was baptized at Blackburn on 10 December 1837, the third son of <a name="cosubject_59910"></a><span class="headword">James Bullough</span>  (1799&#150;1868)<span class="occ"></span> and his wife, Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mellor. In becoming a textile machinery maker, John Bullough had before him the example of his father, whose inventions greatly improved the powered weaving of cloth. James Bullough was born at Westhoughton, Lancashire, the son of Ann Bullough, and was put to the hand-loom when he was seven. The need to improve the clumsy power-looms of his youth stimulated his inventive genius and for most of his life he strove to make weaving more efficient. James Bullough is best remembered for the weft fork, which stopped the loom when the thread broke, thus preventing the shuttle from damaging the cloth. Controversy surrounded the invention, which Bullough and James Kenworthy, co-workers in a Blackburn mill, patented in 1841 (no. 8790); John Osbaldeston (<i>c</i>.1777&#150;1842) also laid claim to it. Bullough, either alone or with others, took out patents covering all aspects of weaving. These included a roller temple that kept the woven cloth at its correct width and a loose reed that allowed the lathe to back away on encountering a shuttle trapped in the warp. With two employees, James Whittaker and John Walmsley, Bullough perfected a machine that sized two warps and wound them on two beams at the same time. Bullough managed and ran a number of small mills in Lancashire before joining John Howard in a textile machinery business at Accrington in 1856. Howard had begun three years earlier with four employees but with Bullough's backing expansion accelerated. The firm of Howard and Bullough specialized in machines for preparing and spinning cotton, and by 1866, the year of Howard's death, employed 300 workpeople. James Bullough died on 31 July 1868, leaving the business to his son John.<br>
<br>John Bullough studied at Queenwood College, Hampshire, and Glasgow University before joining his father's firm in 1859. Though he took out more than twenty patents, of which the electric stop motion, used in numerous machines, was the most important, he is best remembered for promoting the ring frame at a time when British spinners preferred the slower-moving mule. The machine, which had been developed in the United States, was a more efficient version of the throstle, itself an improvement on Sir Richard Arkwright's water frame. Bullough acquired the rights to a new type, the Rabbeth spindle, in 1879, and in the succeeding years kept the machines in the firm's expanding Globe Works running night and day to meet international demand. A technical school started by Bullough in 1881 was among the first of its kind.<br>
<br>The appointment of skilled managers to oversee the 2000 workpeople enabled Bullough to spend more time on his estate at Castle Meggernie, Perthshire, and on the island of Rum in the Inner Hebrides, both of which he bought in the 1880s. Throughout his life Bullough was an active Conservative and spoke regularly in support of self-help, <i>laissez-faire</i> capitalism, and union with Ireland. He married in 1868 Bertha Schmidlin, daughter of a Swiss cotton manufacturer. They had two children, <a href="#cosubject_46789">George [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Bertha. The marriage ended in divorce, after which, in 1884, Bullough married Alexandra Marion McKenzie, daughter of a Stornaway banker. The children of this marriage were John and Gladys. Bullough died at the Hotel Metropole, Westminster, aged fifty-three, on 25 February 1891, and was buried on Rum.<br>
<br>John Bullough's son <a name="cosubject_46789"></a><span class="headword">Sir George Bullough</span>, baronet  (1870&#150;1939)<span class="occ"></span>, was born at Accrington on 28 February 1870 and was educated at Harrow School. As a young man he sailed round the world in his steam yacht, buying works of art, on one occasion outbidding the emperor of Japan for an ivory figure. His treasures found a home in Kinloch Castle, which he built on Rum in 1900&#150;01 at a cost of &pound;250,000. On the outbreak of the South African War Bullough converted his yacht into a floating hospital and sailed to South Africa, a service rewarded with a knighthood in 1901. He married in 1903 Monica Lilly, the eldest daughter of the fourth marquis de la Pasture. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>On his father's death George inherited half the equity of Howard and Bullough, of which he was chairman until his death. The setting up of a United States subsidiary in 1893 and the introduction of profit sharing in 1906 were highlights of his early years with the company. In 1931 the company took part in the merger that led to the formation of Textile Machinery Makers. Bullough left the day-to-day running of the business to others, preferring the racetrack and the hunting field to the board room, and in compiling his entry for <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> he made no reference to his business interests.<br>
<br>In 1908&#150;11 Bullough served in the Scottish Horse imperial yeomanry and during the First World War he was superintendent of the remount department with the rank of major. He also made an interest-free loan of &pound;50,000 to the government. For these services, he received a baronetcy in 1916. For fourteen years from 1908 he was master of Ledbury hounds. He served both the Jockey Club and the National Hunt Committee, and in 1917 his horse Ballymacad won the &#145;war&#146; Grand National at Gatwick. Bullough died at the Ch&acirc;teau de Courcet in the Pas-de-Calais, France, on 26 July 1939; he was buried in the family mausoleum on Rum.<br>
