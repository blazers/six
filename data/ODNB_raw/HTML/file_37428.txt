<span class="headword">Fox, Sir  (Charles) Douglas</span>  (1840&#150;1921), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born near Smethwick on 14 May 1840, the eldest in the family of three sons and one daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10022/', "Sir Charles Fox (1810&#150;1874)")</script>, civil engineer, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Joseph Brookhouse, clockmaker, of Derby. He attended Cholmondeley School, Highgate School (1851&#150;4), King's College School (1854&#150;5), and King's College, London (1855&#150;7), of which he became an honorary fellow in 1887.<br>
<br>Fox was to have gone to Trinity College, Cambridge, but that plan foundered with the sudden financial collapse in early 1857 of his father's erstwhile flourishing contracting business. Instead, he was articled to his father who, later in 1857, had begun to practise as a consulting engineer in London. In 1863 Fox joined his father in partnership. The latter had already built an international reputation in railway and allied engineering. By 1865 the new practice was involved in major projects in Britain, the USA, Canada, southern Africa, India, Australia, and South America. Douglas Fox's potential was well exercised when, from 1863 to 1866, the firm, still just father and son, masterminded the complex system of railway viaducts and bridges in Battersea, separating the lines from the east and south to Victoria from those from the south-west to Waterloo, including the widening of the Grosvenor Bridge over the Thames from two to seven tracks.<br>
<br>Sir Charles Fox died in 1874. His second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33232/', "Francis Fox")</script>, had joined the partnership, which the two brothers now carried on together as Douglas Fox &amp; Partners. Work continued to pour in, especially from southern Africa and South America, but also at home. The brothers' commitments included acting as consulting engineers to the Central Argentine Railway Company (jointly with Livesey, Son and Henderson); the South Indian Railway Company; the Southern S&atilde;o Paulo Railway Company; and also the Dorada (Columbia) Railway Company. In 1886 Douglas Fox and James Brunlees were knighted on completion of the first tunnel under the Mersey which, along with the railway linking Birkenhead with Liverpool, they had jointly engineered.<br>
<br>Among the many projects for which the firm was responsible during Fox's later years were the Liverpool Overhead Railway (the first electric elevated city railway in the world), the extension from Rugby to London of the Great Central Railway, including its Marylebone terminal, the Great Northern and City tube (with large tunnels to accommodate standard rolling stock), and the &#145;Hampstead tube&#146; linking Charing Cross with Golders Green and Highgate. Abroad they included much of the Cape government railways in southern Africa, the whole Rhodesia railway system, including the 500 ft span Victoria Falls arch bridge over the Zambezi River, the Benguela railway in Angola, and several railways and other works in South America.<br>
<br>Fox was president of the Institution of Civil Engineers (1899&#150;1900). He was a JP for many years. Like his father, he was of an urbane and generous disposition. Having inherited his mother's religious principles, he was strict in his observances, and not only at home, but also at his office, prayers began each day for all present. A member of the Church of England, he was active in the Church Missionary Society. In 1863 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1920), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38155/', "Francis Wright")</script>, a Derbyshire industrialist of Osmaston Manor, Derby. They had one son and four daughters. His brother Francis also married a daughter of Francis Wright, whose Butterley Company manufactured railway equipment, including the cast iron for Vauxhall Bridge and Paddington Station.<br>
<br>Fox died on 13 November 1921 at 27 Campden House Road, Kensington, the home of one of his daughters.<br>
