<span class="headword">Justice <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Surby]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (1703&#150;1752), <span class="occ">author</span>, was the eldest child of Dorset Surby of Hatton Garden, London, and his second wife, Ann Ellis. The major source for her biography is her novel <span class="italic">Amelia, or, The Distress'd Wife</span> (1751), which was a thinly disguised autobiography. If its account is reliable, Elizabeth was educated in a boarding-school in Hackney and at home with a private tutor. At sixteen she married a barrister and Cambridge graduate some seven years her senior, Henry Justice (<i>d</i>. 1763), with whom she had three children. After they married, she discovered that her husband, an avid book collector, was unwilling to divert much of his earnings from his hobby to maintaining his family. <span class="italic">Amelia</span> describes the breakdown of the marriage under her growing indebtedness. Although she eventually secured a settlement from her husband of &pound;25 annually, this was not enough to pay her creditors. In order to devote the sum to servicing her debts, she began looking for employment as a governess. As she did not speak French, she was advised to go abroad. She readily accepted a position in Russia as governess to the children of Hill Evans (<i>d</i>. 1740), a member of the English merchant community in St Petersburg, for whom she worked for three years.<br>
<br>Justice returned reluctantly to England in 1737 as a result of the scandal which enveloped her estranged husband after he was sentenced to transportation to America for stealing sixty rare books from the Cambridge University Library. Her writing appeared in print for the first time in that year when, without her permission, the unscrupulous publisher Edmund Curll published in the fifth volume of <span class="italic">Mr. Pope's Literary Correspondence</span> four letters she had written from St Petersburg to a friend in London. Two years later she published by subscription her <span class="italic">Voyage to Russia</span>, the first British eyewitness account of the country that had appeared since John Perry's <span class="italic">The State of Russia under the Present Czar</span> (1716), and the first that reflected the condition of the country after the death of Peter the Great in 1725. The 600 copies she had printed eventually sold out, and she was encouraged by a &#145;Lady of Quality&#146; to issue a second edition in 1746, which was slightly enlarged through the inclusion of the letters Curll had published in 1737.<br>
<br>On this occasion Justice assembled an impressive list of subscribers representing a cross-section of the provincial gentry. Altogether she managed to interest 281 subscribers, including the Wisbech Book Club (and dozens of other subscribers from this area&#151;King's Lynn, Peterborough, and Stamford), in her endeavour. The <span class="italic">Voyage</span> went unnoticed by the metropolitan intellectual community. It was neither reviewed by the periodical press nor acknowledged by subsequent travellers. It is probably of more interest to readers today as the first travel account in English written by a woman. According to Anthony Cross the <span class="italic">Voyage</span> offered an &#145;account of Russian customs and habits &hellip; seen from somewhat lower down the social scale than usual&#146;  (Cross, 339). In 1751 Justice's continuing financial desperation led her to publish, again by subscription, <span class="italic">Amelia</span>, the tale of the hardship brought on her by her unfortunate marriage. She died in the following year.<br>
