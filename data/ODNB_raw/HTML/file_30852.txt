<span class="headword">Brittain, Sir  Henry Ernest <span class="st"> [Harry]</span></span>  (1873&#150;1974), <span class="occ">journalist and politician</span>, was born on 24 December 1873 at Storth Oaks, Ranmoor, near Sheffield, Yorkshire, the oldest surviving child in the family of two sons and three daughters (one daughter died in infancy) of William Henry Brittain (1835&#150;1922), twice mayor of Sheffield, and twice master cutler, and his wife, Frances, daughter of J. J. Mellor of Prestbury, Cheshire. He was educated at Repton School and Worcester College, Oxford, where he was awarded a third-class degree in jurisprudence in 1896. After a year's training in the family steel business in Sheffield, he moved to London, where he was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1897, but he never practised.<br>
<br>Brittain's first job was as private secretary to Sir William Ingram, managing director of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, leaving to work for C. Arthur Pearson, founder of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, when Pearson acquired <span class="italic">The Standard</span> and the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> in 1902. In 1905 he married Alida Luisa (1883&#150;1943), only daughter of Sir Robert Harvey of Dundridge, Devon, and his French wife. Alida, a Roman Catholic, had been born in Chile, where her father had made his fortune in the nitrate trade. A composer and a fine harpist, she was created DBE in 1928 for her political activities. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Inspired by his first visit to the United States in 1902, Brittain joined a group of American journalists and lawyers in London who were discussing the idea of founding a society that would bring Americans and Englishmen together to promote Anglo-American good fellowship. When the Pilgrims Society was formed in July 1902, Brittain was appointed honorary secretary. The Pilgrims Society of the United States was founded in New York in January 1903, with membership of one automatically entailing membership of the other. Harry Brittain was in his element as he built up the membership list, and invited distinguished guests to dinners, and soon he was the effective head of the organization. With a dinner in 1905 to welcome the new American ambassador, Whitelaw Reid, to Britain, the Pilgrims established the tradition that the first public speech made by an incoming American ambassador would be to the Pilgrims. Harry Brittain became chairman in 1913, and after he resigned in 1919 he was elected a vice-president.<br>
<br>When Arthur Pearson was appointed chairman of the new Tariff Reform League by Joseph Chamberlain in July 1903, Brittain helped him to organize it. The Liberal landslide in the 1906 general election put an end to the league. In 1907, however, while visiting Canada as a member of a Board of Trade delegation, Brittain had the idea of organizing a meeting of the editors and owners of newspapers from all parts of the empire. He devoted the next two years to winning support for the first Imperial Press Conference, which took place in London in 1909, with fifty-five overseas representatives and over twenty British newspapermen. One permanent result of the conference was the formation of the Empire Press Union (from 1950, the Commonwealth Press Union).<br>
<br>With the outbreak of the First World War, Brittain was sent by Lord Grey on a mission to the United States in May 1915 representing the Royal Colonial Institute; he sailed on the last voyage of the <i>Lusitania</i> before it was torpedoed by the Germans. In 1917 he spent five months as director of the intelligence branch of the national service department. After the entry of the United States into the war, Brittain mobilized the Pilgrims Society to establish the American Officers' Club.<br>
<br>Harry Brittain was knighted in 1918 and successfully fought the 1918 &#145;coupon&#146; election as Unionist candidate for the new constituency of Acton, serving as MP until his defeat in the 1929 general election. He steered a private member's bill for the protection of wild singing birds through parliament in 1925, and he was on the committee of the Empire Parliamentary Association. During the 1930s he busied himself with his numerous committees: he was, for example, on the committee of the Oxford Society, founded in 1932 along the lines of an American alumni association, and he took on the responsibility of tracing Oxford University graduates in the United States and the empire.<br>
<br>At the beginning of the Second World War, Brittain hoped for a job in the United States on an Anglo-American committee, but when this failed to materialize he became vice-chairman of a government hospitality committee for American servicemen, set up in 1942. Together with the chairman, Sir Edward Grigg, he started the Churchill Club, and organized the Oxford leave courses at Balliol College. He also joined the panel of the Anglo-American Brains Trust, touring British army camps.<br>
<br>Sir Harry Brittain was a superb organizer, attending to every detail, and he loved committees: he was a member of the British Peace Centenary Committee from 1912 to 1914, president of the British International Association of Journalists in 1920&#150;1922, representative of the British Olympic Association at the winter games in Chamonix in 1924, a founder member of the British Travel Association in 1929, and a vice-president of the English-Speaking Union. Although he was not universally popular, he was very gregarious, a member of the Bath and Carlton clubs, and a well-known public figure, always with a carnation in his buttonhole (the &#145;Sir Harry Brittain&#146; carnation won an award at the 1938 Chelsea flower show). He also loved travel, and claimed to have visited every country in Europe except Albania, and every state in the United States. He was a fine sportsman, excelling especially at tennis, skiing, and shooting, and enjoying golf. He was also a prolific writer: his books include <span class="italic">To Verdun from the Somme</span> (1917); <span class="italic">The ABC of the BBC: the Romance of British Wireless</span> (1932); a history of the first forty years of the Pilgrims Society, <span class="italic">Pilgrim Partners</span> (1942); and two volumes of autobiography, <span class="italic">Pilgrims and Pioneers</span> (1945) and <span class="italic">Happy Pilgrimage</span> (1949).<br>
<br>In 1961 Brittain remarried. His second wife was Muriel Lesley (1905&#150;1994), daughter of H. Leslie Dixon; she had been his private secretary since the mid-1950s. He remained active to the very end of his long life, and, as Lord Astor said at his memorial service, he never lost his &#145;boyish enthusiasm&#146;. Elected Pilgrim emeritus in 1971, he resigned the chairmanship of the Pilgrims' membership committee in 1972 at the age of ninety-eight, and was guest of honour at the seventieth anniversary dinner on 25 January 1972. The last Pilgrims function he attended was only a few weeks before his death, on 9 July 1974 at his London home, 88 St James's Street, SW1. He was buried on 12 July at Randalls Park, Leatherhead, Surrey.<br>
