<span class="headword">Pepys,  Henry</span>  (1783&#150;1860), <span class="occ">bishop of Worcester</span>, was born in Wimpole Street, London, on 18 April 1783. He was the third son of Sir William Weller Pepys and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dowdeswell. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21902/', "Charles Christopher Pepys, earl of Cottenham")</script>, was his brother. He was educated at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, matriculating in 1800 and graduating BA in 1804; he then migrated as a fellow to St John's College, Cambridge, and proceeded MA in 1807, BD in 1814, and DD in 1840.<br>
<br>Pepys was ordained priest in 1808 and was curate of Swaffham Prior from 1808. He was rector of Aspeden, Hertfordshire, from 12 June 1818 to 28 April 1827, and held with it the college living of Moreton, Essex, from 16 August 1822 until 1840. On 3 February 1826 he was appointed a prebendary of Wells, and on 31 March 1827 rector of Westmill, Hertfordshire. In politics he was a Liberal. On 27 January 1840 he was, on Lord Melbourne's recommendation, elevated to the bishopric of Sodor and Man; he was consecrated at Whitehall on 1 March, arrived at Douglas, Isle of Man, on 27 April, was installed at St Mary's, Castleton, on 8 May 1840, and left the island on 4 May 1841, on his translation&#151;also by the whig government&#151;to the see of Worcester.<br>
<br>In the House of Lords, although Pepys voted in favour of the chief Liberal measures, he spoke only twice, on ecclesiastical questions of small importance. He was one of the bishops who assisted at the controversial consecration of R. D. Hampden in 1847, and he publicly attacked the high-church bishop Henry Phillpotts. Personally Pepys was popular, and was conscientious in the discharge of his diocesan duties. He was a generous patron of the triennial festival of the Three Choirs.<br>
<br>Pepys married, on 27 January 1824, Maria, third daughter of the Rt Hon. John Sullivan, commissioner of the Board of Control. They had four children: Philip Henry, registrar of the London court of bankruptcy; Herbert George, honorary canon of Worcester; Maria Louisa, who married the Revd Edward Winnington Ingram; and Emily, who married the Revd William Henry Lyttelton, and died on 12 September 1877.<br>
<br>Pepys published <span class="italic">The Remains of the Late Lord Viscount Royston, with a Memoir of his Life</span> (1838), six charges, and two sermons. He died at Hartlebury Castle, Stourport, Worcestershire, on 13 November 1860. He was survived by his wife, who died aged eighty-nine, on 17 June 1885.<br>
