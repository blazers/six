<span class="headword">Spens,  Janet</span>  (1876&#150;1963), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born on 23 January 1876 at Bellevue, Hamilton, Lanarkshire, the second daughter of Walter Cook Spens (1842&#150;1900), a Glasgow advocate and sheriff-substitute of Lanarkshire, and his wife, Helen (<i>d</i>. 1927), daughter of Sir John Gillespie of Edinburgh. Janet was one of eleven children, only seven of whom survived to adulthood. She and a sister were sent to live with an aunt, Mrs Lizzie Robertson, in Edinburgh. Until she was fourteen she was educated by governesses and thereafter she attended private classes in Edinburgh. She then returned to Glasgow and enrolled at Glasgow University, graduating MA in 1899.<br>
<br>In 1901 Miss Spens went to Versailles as a <i>r&eacute;p&eacute;titrice</i>. The following year she returned to Glasgow, where she held a class for adults and gave a series of lectures on nineteenth-century poets. In 1903 she and Margaret Hannan Watson founded Laurel Bank School for Girls in Glasgow. During her five years teaching at Laurel Bank, she continued her adult literature classes. She was happiest teaching adults: to her, the quintessence of things was revealed only in art, especially literature, and above all in poetry. Great literature was written by adults, for adults, and chiefly about adult experiences. In 1908 she was appointed assistant lecturer in the English department at Glasgow University and in 1909 she was appointed tutor to the women students in arts. Her first work, <span class="italic">Two Periods of Disillusion</span>, was published the same year and the following year she gained the degree of DLitt.<br>
<br>In 1911 Miss Spens was appointed tutor in English literature at Lady Margaret Hall, where she remained for twenty-five years, latterly as a fellow. She was unusual in holding such a post without having been a student at one of the Oxford or Cambridge women's colleges; her appointment was a reflection of the high opinion of her work held by her teachers and colleagues, including Gilbert Murray and A. C. Bradley. She enjoyed Greek and French literature and was interested by metaphysics and theology. Her subtle mind expressed itself either in ingenious suppositions or imaginative penetration. She published three more books, <span class="italic">An Essay on Shakespeare's Relation to Tradition</span> (1916), <span class="italic">Elizabethan Drama</span> (1922), and <span class="italic">Spenser's Faerie Queene: an Interpretation</span> (1934), the last of which was the most original and provocative. She also wrote a number of articles, reviews, and essays. She did not publish as much as she may have wished, partly because she never found writing easy. Her lecturing, too, was rather strained. She was best in small groups, or tutoring, though her sharp mind and forthright criticism could make it rather an ordeal for her students. She regarded the contemporary emphasis on self-expression and self-development in educational theories as mistaken. She was keenly interested in all aspects of education and with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34582/', "Eleanor Lodge")</script>, the history tutor at Lady Margaret Hall, she started the Oxford National Education Association to provide contacts between teachers in elementary and secondary schools and university academics.<br>
<br>Janet Spens and Eleanor Lodge formed a lifelong friendship. They shared holiday cottages and bought a house in Oxford to which they intended to retire. Miss Spens was devotedly nursed by Eleanor Lodge through a protracted period of severe illness, which began shortly after her arrival at Lady Margaret Hall and lasted through the First World War. Eleanor Lodge died in 1936, but Janet Spens remained for the rest of her life at their house at 5 Fyfield Road, Oxford. During the Second World War she was an indefatigable air-raid warden and had a houseful of evacuee children.<br>
<br>Miss Spens was described by friends as unshockable, for her scrupulous sincerity led her to question moral and literary values. Her sincerity also resulted in a &#145;ruthlessness in criticism which made her formidable as a tutor and extremely candid in friendship&#146;  (K. M. L., <span class="italic">The Brown Book</span>, 33). But she was enormously kind and would go far out of her way to help others, while her originality was heightened by her idiosyncrasies. Her unintentional remarks provided sheer comedy, and she was notoriously absent-minded. But she was always the first to laugh at herself.<br>
<br>The Oxford National Education Association ended in the 1930s and Janet Spens retired as tutor at Lady Margaret Hall in 1936, but she continued teaching part-time and discussing education into her seventies. Each term she invited the university English women tutors for a literary evening with papers and discussions. She was created an Oxford MA by decree when women were admitted to full membership of the university. In 1944 Glasgow University awarded her an honorary LLD and in 1954 she was elected an emeritus fellow of Lady Margaret Hall. She died at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, on 14 January 1963, having suffered near-blindness in her last few years.<br>
