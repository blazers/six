<span class="headword">Ludlow,  Roger</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1590, <em>d.</em> after 1664?), <span class="occ">colonial governor and jurist</span>, was baptized on 7 March 1590 at Dinton, Wiltshire, the second son of Thomas Ludlow (1550&#150;1607), landowner, and his wife, Jane (1561&#150;1648), the daughter of Thomas Pyle of Bapton, Wiltshire. He was admitted to Balliol College, Oxford, on 16 June 1610, then entered the Inner Temple in November 1612, but was not called to the bar. He married Mary Endecott, whose parentage is unknown but who was the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8802/', "John Endecott")</script>, later governor of Massachusetts Bay. His first wife having died, he is said to have married Mary (1604&#150;1664?), daughter of Philobert Cogan, in 1624. Ludlow's legal training, in combination with his devout commitment to Congregationalism, probably influenced his election as an assistant by the Massachusetts Bay Company in February 1630, during the company's final meeting in England. As an assistant and a lay leader, Ludlow, accompanied by his younger brother <a href="#cosubject_17162">George [<i>see below</i>]</a> and approximately 140 others, sailed to New England on the <i>Mary and John</i>, one of the ships that made up John Winthrop's fleet, and arrived in Massachusetts Bay in May 1630. There, they created a settlement which they named Dorchester.<br>
<br>Ludlow held a position of prominence in the fledgeling Massachusetts Bay Colony, becoming one of its leading citizens and a major landowner. He served for four years as an assistant to the company in Boston, and in 1634 he became deputy governor of the colony, but he was not elected to office in 1635, either because of his opposition to increasing democracy in the election of magistrates, or because he may already have had plans to leave the colony. In the same year he led a migration of Dorchester residents to Connecticut, where they settled at Windsor. In Connecticut Ludlow served as the chief officer of the commission set up by the Massachusetts government to govern the new colony, as well as holding the office of deputy governor in alternate years. His responsibilities included signing a treaty with the Pequot nation after the brief but bloody war between the settlers and the Indians in 1637&#150;8, and serving as a delegate to the Cambridge synod of 1637, which met in order to formulate a response to the challenge presented by Anne Hutchinson and the Antinomians. By 1639 he had moved to the south-west of the colony and helped to found Fairfield.<br>
<br>Although Ludlow was &#145;stern, passionate, and demanding&#146; and possessed a &#145;quick temper and a sharp tongue&#146;  (Jones, 74), he was greatly respected for his commitment to the young colony and especially for his extensive knowledge of the law. In 1639 he was involved in putting together the &#145;fundamental orders&#146; which provided the basis for Connecticut's constitutional arrangements; setting out the authority of the government and methods of election. In 1646 the general court of Connecticut commissioned him to codify the laws of the colony. The resulting Code of 1650 contained some twenty original provisions, the other fifty-eight being derived substantially from Massachusetts laws, particularly the Massachusetts Bay laws and liberties of 1648. It was &#145;a sweeping corpus of law that described the duties and powers of every colony and town official&#146;  (Daniels, 66), and it gave Ludlow a posthumous reputation as the &#145;Father of Connecticut Jurisprudence&#146;.<br>
<br>Ludlow had helped to set up the united colonies of New England in 1643, the first federation of the American colonies, and in 1648, 1651, and 1653 was Connecticut's commissioner to the federation. In 1653 the colonies were bitterly divided on the issue of whether to go to war with the Dutch, and Connecticut, frustrated at the delays, appointed Ludlow as their commander in preparation for an attack on the Dutch. Events went no further before the First Anglo-Dutch War ceased in 1654, by which time Ludlow had sold his Connecticut lands and sailed for Dublin, where on 3 November 1654 he was appointed commissioner for forfeited lands (perhaps on the recommendation of his relation <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17161/', "Edmund Ludlow")</script>, lieutenant-general of Ireland), and later the same year JP for Dublin and Cork. In February 1660 he filed a suit in chancery in England against his nephew Thomas, in which he described himself as of Dublin, and he may have been still alive in 1664 when a Mary Ludlow, wife of Roger Ludlow, was buried on 3 June at St Michan's parish church, Dublin.<br>
<br>Ludlow's younger brother <a name="cosubject_17162"></a><span class="headword">George Ludlow</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1596, <em>d.</em> 1655)<span class="occ"></span> was baptized at Dinton on 15 September 1596. He accompanied his brother to the Massachusetts Bay Colony on the <i>Mary and John</i> in 1630, and became a freeman of Massachusetts later that year. In 1631 he returned to England, but by 1638 had established himself in Virginia, where the land registry records that he was granted 17,000 acres of land. He served for many years as the lieutenant of York County, bearing the title of colonel, and served as a member of Virginia's council from 1642 to 1655. He died about 23 October 1655, having had no children with his wife, Elizabeth.<br>
