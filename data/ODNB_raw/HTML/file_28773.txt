<span class="headword">Warren,  Arthur</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1605), <span class="occ">poet</span>, is known only through his authorship of a volume of poetry published in 1605, <span class="italic">The Poore Man's Passions, and Povertie's Patience</span>. Entered in the Stationers' register on 14 January 1605, it was published in London in 1605 and printed by I[ames] R[oberts]. Warren dedicated the volume to &#145;his kindest Favourer Maister Robert Quarme&#146; (possibly the Robert Quarme of Woodhouse, Devon, father of Walter Quarme, BA 1615&#150;16, Lincoln College, Oxford). Nothing else is known of Warren, but several nineteenth-century scholars have suggested that he was the &#145;A. W.&#146; to whom were attributed a variety of poems in the last decades of the sixteenth century, but primarily the eighty-one in Francis Davison's miscellany, <span class="italic">A Poetical Rhapsody, 1602&#150;1621</span>. If these poems were written by one person, &#145;then&#146;, as Hyder Rollins said in his edition (1932) of the miscellany, &#145;one of the greatest poets of the Elizabethan period is still unknown&#146;  (Davison, 2.65). However, thanks to Rollins's rigorous analysis it seems most likely that the &#145;A. W.&#146; poems were by several writers, that Arthur Warren was not one of them, and that &#145;A. W.&#146; probably stands for &#145;anonymous writer&#146;.<br>
<br>It has been claimed that Warren composed his poems while he was imprisoned for debt. While there is no evidence for this, clearly the author is a man of some education living in extreme penury. In any case the two poems confirm that he was not &#145;one of the greatest poets of the Elizabethan period&#146;. Both poems are as awkwardly phrased as they are monotonous, each obsessively concerned with a single topic. &#145;The Poore Man's Passions&#146; describes the vast gulf between the heartless rich and hopelessly poor people like himself. &#145;Povertie's Patience&#146; preaches to the poor that &#145;patience&#146; produces &#145;content&#146; and can only be gained by those ascetic enough to renounce all worldly goods. Yet despite their artistic ineptitude these poems merit attention as a literate outcry by someone rarely heard from at first hand in the Jacobean period, one of the &#145;poor naked wretches&#146; of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">King Lear</span>. Warren's poems are not merely a complaint. They have a political agenda: that it is the toil of the poor that makes possible the extravagant, selfish lives of the Jacobean conspicuous consumers:<blockquote>
<div>Diggers, and Dikers, Drudges, Carters, Swaines,<br>
</div>
<div>&hellip; The poorest persons worke thy richest gaines.<br>
</div>
<div>&hellip; Coblers, and Curriers, Tinkers, Tanners all<br>
</div>
<div>Support thy state, else would thy fortress fall;<br>
</div>
</blockquote>and that the rulers should:<blockquote>
<div>Summon a Parliament &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>To extirpate the roots of misery.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Poore Man's Passion</span>, sigs. [B4], [B5<i>v</i>])</blockquote>Warren's words were eerily prophetic of various idealistic programmes like that of Gerrard Winstanley, the mid-century communitarian &#145;Digger&#146;, who argued that &#145;Rich men receive all they have from labourer's hand&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Law of Freedom</span>, 1652). But with the collapse of revolutionary fervour and the restoration of the monarchy those who had na&iuml;vely hoped to level the playing field soon discovered, as Warren foresaw, that like Tantalus:<blockquote>
<div>what they [the poor] stoop to take, too low doth lie;<br>
</div>
<div>And what they reach to catch, ascends too hie.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Poore Man's Passion</span>, sig. [E2])</blockquote>
