<span class="headword">Johnston, Sir  John Baines <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1918&#150;2005), <span class="occ">civil servant and diplomatist</span>, was born on 13 May 1918 at 8 The Ghyll, Ellenborough, Maryport, Cumberland, the son of Andrew Smith Johnston, Baptist clergyman, and his wife, Nora Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Baines, schoolteacher, and daughter of a blacksmith. When he was two the family moved to Derby; later they moved to Banbury in Oxfordshire. They were poor and family life revolved around the church. The First World War made his father a pacifist and he brought up his son in the same way. Johnston was educated at Banbury grammar school, where he was captain of cricket and rugby, and then, thanks to two scholarships, at Queen's College, Oxford, where he read modern history. When the Second World War began he was accepted as a conscientious objector and, after graduating with a second-class degree in 1940, was posted to the Pioneer Corps, a non-combatant unit, in Devon. There his views about the war changed and later in 1940 he enlisted. He joined the infantry and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Oxford and Buckinghamshire light infantry. He took part in the D-day landings and was then attached, as adjutant, to the Gordon Highlanders during the British advance into Holland. He was demobilized in 1946 with the rank of major.<br>
<br>In 1947 Johnston joined the Colonial Office. He was in Ghana in 1950&#150;51 as assistant secretary to the West African Council and was then, until 1956, principal private secretary to Oliver Lyttelton and Alan Lennox-Boyd, two Conservative secretaries of state for the colonies. He was assistant secretary and head of the Far Eastern department at the Colonial Office when Malaya became independent in 1957. Transferred to the Commonwealth Relations Office the same year, from 1959 to 1961 he was in South Africa as deputy high commissioner, a formative period from which he emerged with a strong distaste for apartheid. He was there in February 1960 when the prime minister, Harold Macmillan, addressed both houses of the South African parliament at Cape Town during his African tour. No one assumed Macmillan's &#145;wind of change&#146; speech would change South African minds and South Africa left the Commonwealth a year later. But it was still hailed as a success, because it was a statement of British policy about accommodating African nationalism within a Commonwealth context made in the heartland of apartheid. A number of individuals were involved in drafting the speech, among them Johnston, who was consulted by Sir John Maud, the high commissioner. After South Africa Johnston was high commissioner to Sierra Leone, 1961&#150;3, during which time he was appointed CMG, in 1962.<br>
<br>In 1963 Johnston became high commissioner to the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. When he arrived in Salisbury, the capital of Southern Rhodesia and seat of the federal government, the federation was on the point of breaking up. Britain's efforts to reconcile the conflicting aspirations of the minority white populations in Northern and Southern Rhodesia with those of the black majorities in all three territories ended in failure. The Central African Federation, as it was known, was dissolved in December 1963. Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia were set on course for separate independence which they achieved in July and October 1964 respectively, as Malawi and Zambia. This left Southern Rhodesia, internally self-governing under white rule since 1923, to which territory Johnston was now high commissioner alone. One of Johnston's earliest observations was that the Europeans in Rhodesia lived &#145;in a state of mental insulation from the outside world only surpassed by South Africa&#146;. Persuaded there were no &#145;good solutions&#146; to the Rhodesian problem, only &#145;difficulties and dangers&#146;, the high commissioner was clear there could be no long-term future for the Europeans in Southern Rhodesia &#145;through a policy of white supremacy and African suppression&#146;  (Hyam and Louis, 2.525).<br>
<br>In April 1964 the ruling Rhodesian Front in Rhodesia split. Winston Field was ousted as leader and replaced by Ian Smith. Johnston was one of the first to realize that Smith was a prisoner of the right wing of the party, which had engineered Field's downfall. In June 1964 he described Smith as dour and reserved, giving the impression of &#145;stubbornness of will and purpose, not entirely offset by his boyish appearance&#146;. He believed Smith led a government with which there was no prospect of a negotiated settlement, so determined was it to maintain white supremacy and &#145;so impregnably armoured in self-righteousness&#146;  (Murphy, 2.382). But it was not in Johnston's view irrevocably set on a course of rebellion. However bleak the prospects, he argued that Britain had little option but to &#145;sit out the present situation&#146;, in the hope ultimately that Smith's government would alienate its own followers.<br>
<br>Two resounding by-election victories for the Rhodesian Front in October 1964 strengthened Smith's position. Considering Smith's intentions, Johnston now thought he was set on either &#145;independence at all costs&#146;, or exploiting his poll success to acquire additional leverage to find an acceptable way out because he still feared the consequences of an illegal declaration. The first hypothesis appeared to Johnston nearer the truth. &#145;We shall know very soon&#146;, was his verdict  (Murphy, 2.400). He also wondered if pressure could be applied through Rhodesia's neighbours, South Africa and colonial Portugal, but officials in London thought this would make matters worse. Prime Minister Harold Wilson's personal intervention during a visit to Rhodesia in November 1965 failed to resolve the impasse. Smith made his unilateral declaration of independence on 11 November 1965. Johnston was withdrawn the next day.<br>
<br>In 1966 Johnston was knighted KCMG and for the next two years he was in London as assistant under-secretary of state at the Commonwealth Office. His areas of responsibility covered the Indian subcontinent and Nigeria at the time of the civil war. When the Commonwealth Office merged with the Foreign Office in October 1968 he was appointed deputy under-secretary of state in charge of the Far Eastern group of departments. On 17 May 1969 he married Elizabeth Mary Crace (<i>d</i>. 2004), a 37-year-old teacher, daughter of John Foster Crace, and niece of Lord Redcliffe-Maud, who as Sir John Maud had been high commissioner in South Africa when Johnston was his deputy. They had one son, John (<i>b</i>. 1970). Johnston's diplomatic career ended with two senior Commonwealth postings, as high commissioner to Malaysia (1971&#150;4), and to Canada (1974&#150;8). He was made KCVO in 1972 and GCMG in 1978.<br>
<br>Johnston was professional to a fault. His dispatches, especially from Salisbury, were eloquent and perceptive. Unassuming in character, he was instantly recognizable by a trademark rose in his buttonhole. The empire during his career became the modern Commonwealth. Influenced by his experiences in South Africa and Rhodesia, he believed that the Commonwealth played an invaluable role in promoting international co-operation and fostering interracial harmony. The creation of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 1968 was an uncomfortable period for those, like Johnston, who came from the Commonwealth side of the new department. They feared the merger might become a takeover by the Foreign Office. Their concerns were not without foundation.<br>
<br>In retirement Johnston settled in Oxford. He was a governor of the BBC (1978&#150;85), chairman of the ARELS (Association of Recognised English Language Schools) Examinations Trust (1982&#150;94), and a member of the Disasters Emergency Committee (1985&#150;92). His wife died in December 2004 after a long illness during which Johnston nursed her. He died of lung cancer at 5 Victoria Road, Oxford, on 16 October 2005. His son survived him.<br>
