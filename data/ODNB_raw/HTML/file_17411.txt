<span class="headword">McCulloch, Sir  James</span>  (1819&#150;1893), <span class="occ">politician and entrepreneur in Australia</span>, the son of George McCulloch, a carter, and his wife, Jean Thomson, was born on 19 March 1819 at Glasgow. After a rudimentary education he entered the office of the merchants J. and A. Dennistoun. On 1 August 1841 he married Susan, the daughter of the Revd James Renwick of Muirton, Forfar. In 1853 Dennistouns sent him to open a branch in Melbourne, where his energy, connections, and lively personality quickly made him a leader in the business community, public charities, and institutions. In 1854 he was nominated to the legislative council of Victoria, and in October 1856 he was elected to the first legislative assembly under responsible government.<br>
<br>Described as a mercantile liberal, in the next seven years McCulloch was in and out of the legislative assembly, twice held office amid constant ministerial changes, twice visited Britain, was twice president of the chamber of commerce, formed a new company, McCulloch, Sellar &amp; Co., in succession to Dennistouns, was elected a member of the Melbourne Club, and began to acquire pastoral interests. In 1863, dissatisfied with Charles Duffy's radical and disastrous land selection act which had enabled pastoralists, acting largely through dummies, rather than agricultural selectors, to buy crown lands, he helped to defeat the existing administration and, allied with some of his former radical opponents, became premier and chief secretary in the first stable ministry that Victoria had had.<br>
<br>McCulloch immediately took a strong stand against British proposals to increase convict transportation to Western Australia, and then, after the legislative council, elected on a restricted franchise which strongly favoured squatters and conservatives, twice rejected government land legislation, he went to the country in November 1864 on a programme which included a new land bill, council reform, and moderate tariff increases. He won handsomely and the council was virtually compelled to accept another land bill, which, despite continued dummying, achieved partial success. Partly in revenge, the council opposed the tariff in the name of free trade. McCulloch then &#145;tacked&#146; the customs duties to the appropriation bill, which the council consequently rejected. Uproar ensued; public payments were maintained by the government's borrowing money from the London Chartered Bank, of which McCulloch was the local director (other banks refusing to lend), to which it confessed judgment when sued under the <span class="roman">Crown Remedies and Liabilities Act</span>. Compromise failing and his majority dwindling, McCulloch appealed to the country, and in February 1866 was returned with a crushing and more radical majority. The council then passed the tariff, but its power remained intact.<br>
<br>The dispute was renewed in May 1866 when the imperial government recalled the governor, Sir Charles Darling, for partisanship with the ministry and McCulloch proposed to vote Lady Darling &pound;20,000 in compensation. Colonial government regulations prevented this, until Sir Charles resigned from government service; McCulloch then, in July 1867, put the grant on the estimates, and refused to put it up separately. The council rejected the appropriation bill, and deadlock returned. Fresh elections in February 1868 sent the government back stronger than before, and when London instructed the governor that the grant must be reintroduced separately, McCulloch resigned. His huge majority made a conservative ministry impotent, but eight weeks later, in July, news of Darling's re-entry into the colonial service made the grant unacceptable and unnecessary. McCulloch resumed office, now becoming treasurer as well as premier and chief secretary. Radical disappointment at the inconclusive end of the crises and the concessions to pastoralists which accompanied easier terms for selection in a new land act the following year, together with corruption scandals, weakened his government. It fell on a minor issue in September 1869. McCulloch was knighted in 1870 and became premier and chief secretary again in April of that year. He succeeded in abolishing state aid to religion and won the 1871 elections promising to establish state secular education, but he was defeated in June when his proposals for modest tariff increases dissatisfied the more ardent protectionists in his party, and proposals for a property tax alienated many uncommitted members.<br>
<br>After resigning his seat in March 1872, McCulloch acted as agent-general for Victoria in London during early 1873; the following year his KB was converted to KCMG. He then returned to Australia and re-entered the assembly at the 1874 elections. Although his old party was in power, he first helped to defeat it on taxation, then rejoined it to overthrow the radical Berry ministry, and he became premier and treasurer in October 1875. Berry launched systematic parliamentary obstruction; McCulloch defeated this by introducing the closure, but his attempts to establish a balanced system of direct taxation failed. In May 1877 Berry, campaigning for a land tax on great estates, won a devastating electoral victory. A year later McCulloch resigned from parliament.<br>
<br>McCulloch then devoted himself to business, holding several directorships and helping establish the frozen meat trade. Having been a trustee of the public library, museums, and national gallery of Victoria since 1870, he could now work for it more strenuously, and he played a considerable part in selecting pictures for it. He retired to England in 1886, and died on 30 January 1893 at his residence, Garbrand Hall, Ewell, Surrey, leaving an estate valued at more than &pound;22,000. He was survived by his second wife, Margaret Boak, the daughter of his associate William Inglis of Walflat, Dumbarton, whom he had married on 17 October 1867, but he had had no children from either of his marriages. McCulloch was an honest, energetic, determined, and very effective politician. At times he was ready to compromise, on other occasions he seemed opportunistic and unscrupulous, but he was a consistent liberal who carried out several important reforms.<br>
