<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bale,  John</span>  (1495&#150;1563), <span class="occ">bishop of Ossory, evangelical polemicist, and historian</span>, was born to parents of humble means at the village of Cove, near Dunwich in Suffolk, on 21 November 1495. In his <span class="italic">Illustrium maioris Britanniae</span> Bale names his parents as Henry and Margaret. <h2>
<a name="Earlycareerandmarriage"></a>Early career and marriage</h2>Throughout his life, despite wide travels, Bale continually proclaimed his identity as a Suffolk man. He began his formal education at the Carmelite convent at Norwich at twelve years of age and went to Jesus College, Cambridge, about 1514 in order to continue his schooling. Despite the intellectual ferment at Cambridge University, instigated by clerics like Hugh Latimer and Miles Coverdale who had been influenced by Lutheran ideas, Bale remained at this time a friar loyal to the old religion. After study at Cambridge and abroad, at Louvain and Toulouse, he was awarded the degree of BTh at Cambridge in 1529 and the DTh about two years later. In 1530 he became prior of the white friars' convent in the port town of Maldon in Essex. In 1533 he was promoted to the Carmelite convent at Ipswich, and he had become prior at Doncaster by July 1534.<br>
<br>At the time of England's separation from the Church of Rome during the early 1530s, Bale fell under the influence of Thomas, first Baron Wentworth of Nettlestead, to whom he attributed his conversion to protestantism. Bale enjoyed the patronage of Wentworth, an important East Anglian peer who used his influence at court in order to further the protestant cause. He began to come under suspicion himself, and about 1534 was charged with heresy before Archbishop Lee of York, but escaped conviction. In 1536, immediately before his final break with the Carmelite order, Bale left his priorate at Doncaster for the post of a stipendiary priest at Thorndon in Suffolk.<br>
<br>Although Bale's desire to marry was probably one reason for his leaving the Carmelites, he never made this explicit in his writings. Nevertheless by 1536 he had renounced clerical vows, laid aside monastic attire, and married a woman named Dorothy. Virtually nothing is known about her besides her name, but she must have been a widow when Bale married her because she had a son of apprentice age. Bale's silence about her, even though she accompanied him during two periods of exile and his intervening service as a bishop in Ireland, is noteworthy. For example, she receives only a passing comment in <span class="italic">The Vocacyon of Johan Bale to the Bishoprick of Ossorie in Ireland</span> (1553), when he mentions that he set sail for Ireland with &#145;my wyfe &amp; one servaunt&#146;  (<span class="italic">Vocacyon</span>, 51). Bale's commitment to marriage is in keeping with his obsessive attack on clerical celibacy, which resounds throughout his polemical writings. He sees the mandatory vow of celibacy as an invitation to all forms of sexual transgression, including fornication, adultery, paedophilia, and homosexuality. Thus the <span class="italic">Vocacyon</span> attacks an Irish priest for fathering bastards in order to increase the size of church offerings, and his writings repeatedly allege that the papacy established &#145;stews of both kinds in Rome&#146; (that is, heterosexual and homosexual brothels) for the patronage of unmarried clergy. It may be that Bale's boyhood experience at a Carmelite convent shaped his views on clerical sexuality.<h2>
<a name="Protestantplaywright"></a>Protestant playwright</h2>Bale and other reformers soon became dissatisfied with the conservative nature of religious reformation in the later years of Henry VIII's reign. In 1537, while he was serving as a priest at Thorndon, Bale was arrested for preaching heresy in a sermon that denounced &#145;papistry&#146;. He was subsequently freed, thanks in part to the intercession of John Leland, the king's antiquarian, who was a strong supporter of Bale and his writings, and to whom Bale dedicated his &#145;Anglorum Heliades&#146; of <i>c</i>.1539&#150;1540, a historical and bibliographical account of the Carmelite order in England. This work has the additional interest of showing that Bale had not yet completed his transition from Catholic to protestant theology. Bale also enjoyed the support of Thomas Cromwell, the king's principal minister and vicegerent for religious affairs, and would later acknowledge that Cromwell had arranged his release from prison as a reward for his polemical comedies. The minister supported a troupe of actors led by Bale, who staged allegorical morality plays which promoted protestant ideas and satirized Catholic beliefs by personifying the two sides as Virtues and Vices respectively.<br>
<br>Of twenty-four plays known to have been written by Bale, only five are still extant. His first composition, and the one most widely read today, <span class="italic">King John</span>, was staged at Archbishop Cranmer's house during Christmastide at the end of 1538. Based upon historical material in William Tyndale's <span class="italic">Obedience of a Christian Man</span>, the play flatters Henry VIII as the successor to King John who attacks papal tyranny and completes England's schism from the Church of Rome. Despite assistance from Nobility, Clergy, and Civil Order, the medieval king's attempts at religious reform are blocked by a variety of stage Vices who include Usurped Power (as Pope Innocent III), Private Wealth (as Cardinal Pandulphus), Dissimulation (as Raymundus, a papal legate, and Simon, monk of Swinset), and Sedition (as Stephen Langton). Poisoned by Usurped Power, King John dies before he can complete the task of ecclesiastical reform. After John's death, the play moves triumphantly to Bale's own age when Imperial Majesty (a dramatic type for Henry VIII) defends &#145;Christian faith&#146; and &#145;the authority of God's holy word&#146; against continuing papal aggression.<br>
<br>Printed in 1548 but probably composed much earlier, Bale's <span class="italic">Comedy Concerning Three Laws</span> depicts the downfall of the personified virtues Natural Law, Mosaic Law, and Christian Law. Allegorical costuming presents the victorious Vices and manifestations of Roman Catholic &#145;error&#146;: Sodomy is presented as a monk, Avarice as a common lawyer, Covetousness as a bishop, False Doctrine as a popish doctor, and Hypocrisy as a Franciscan friar. Appearing as an old witch, Idolatry is identified with the Whore of Babylon, herself a symbol of papal Rome. Along with Infidelity, many of these figures possess the attributes of the medieval Vice, whose comic aspect included vulgar blasphemy and obscene jesting. Modelled on the book of <span class="roman">Revelation</span>, the last two acts of the drama culminate in the expulsion of Infidelity by Divine Vengeance. The consequent restoration of the three laws in preparation for the marriage of the Bridegroom and the Spouse at the descent of the New Jerusalem provides an optimistic allegory of the completion of the protestant reformation.<br>
<br>Bale's three remaining plays, composed in 1538 under Cromwell's patronage, adopt themes, conventions, and devices from the medieval mystery and morality plays to protestant purposes. <span class="italic">The Chief Promises of God</span>, <span class="italic">John the Baptist's Preaching</span>, and <span class="italic">The Temptation of Jesus Christ</span> reverse the emphases of the cycles of biblical mystery plays popular during Bale's lifetime. (Derek van der Straten printed them at Wesel, in the county of Cleves, in 1547, during Bale's first exile from England.) Thus <span class="italic">The Chief Promises of God</span> consists of dialogue between Pater Coelestis (the Heavenly Father) and Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Isaiah, and John the Baptist, and represents divine covenants as precursors of the protestant reformation.<h2>
<a name="Thefirstexileanditsfruits"></a>The first exile and its fruits</h2>The passage of the <span class="roman">Act of Six Articles</span> in 1539 marked a major shift in religious policy by reimposing strict orthodoxy and banning protestant tracts, and presaged the downfall of Cromwell, who was executed in the following year. After this reversal of Henry VIII's commitment to ecclesiastical reform Bale fled to the continent, where he continued to produce outspoken controversial writings, including a number of anti-Roman Catholic martyrologies: <span class="italic">A Brief Chronicle Concerning the Examination and Death of Sir John Oldcastle</span> (1544), <span class="italic">The Examination of William Thorpe</span>, and <span class="italic">The Examinations of Anne Askew</span> (1547). These works provided models for John Foxe's highly influential <span class="italic">Actes and Monuments</span>, known popularly as the book of martyrs (1563). While in Germany, Bale also compiled <span class="italic">Acts of English Votaries</span> (1546), an expos&eacute; of alleged monastic corruption, as well as <span class="italic">Yet another Course at the Romish Foxes</span> (1543), which denounces Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, for persecuting English protestants. (Foxe's <span class="italic">Actes and Monuments</span> records Gardiner's counter-attack on Bale's propagandist tracts.) The most influential product of Bale's first exile, however, was <span class="italic">The Image of both Churches</span> (1545), which provided the first complete commentary on the book of <span class="roman">Revelation</span> to be printed in English. This work views Christian history as a continuing struggle between the &#145;true&#146; church, based on Jesus's teachings in the gospels, and the &#145;false&#146; Church of Rome, whose leadership by the pope results from its subversion by Antichrist and the misinterpretation of scriptural texts.<br>
<br>During this exile Bale also wrote and edited numerous tracts including the <span class="italic">Apocalypsis goliae</span>, an anticlerical satire attributed to Walter Map and reissued by Bale as <span class="italic">Rhythmi vetustissimi de corrupto ecclesiae statu</span> (1546); an eyewitness account of the death of Martin Luther by Justus Jonas; and Princess Elizabeth's translation of a devotional text by Marguerite de Navarre entitled <span class="italic">Godly Meditations of the Christian Soul</span> (1548). These works, with many others like them, generally denounce the papacy, the ritualism of the Roman liturgy, belief in transubstantiation and the mass, the veneration of saints, and the cult of the Virgin Mary. In their place Bale advocates protestant practices designed to nurture individual faith: gospel preaching, lay education in the vernacular <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and a service of holy communion that commemorates Christ's sacrifice rather than re-enacting it. Owing to tighter restraints on publication in the later years of Henry VIII's reign, Bale arranged for the printing of his polemical works in Antwerp and, after the imperial authorities also imposed tighter restrictions on protestant publication, in Wesel. He courted death in arranging for the smuggling of his tracts into England, where they went on sale surreptitiously under the pseudonyms of James Harrison and Henry Stalbridge.<br>
<br>Bale also compiled his <span class="italic">Illustrium Maioris Britannie scriptorum &hellip; summarium</span>, which was printed in Wesel in 1548. He more than once expresses indignation and dismay at the destruction of libraries resulting from the dissolution of the monasteries&#151;&#145;To destroye all without consyderacyon, is and wyll be unto Englande for ever, a moste horryble infamy amonge the grave senyours of other nacyons&#146;  (Aston, 327)&#151;and in this book he continued John Leland's antiquarian project of preserving and cataloguing their manuscript holdings, in an arrangement along the lines of his own apocalyptic periodization of history in the <span class="italic">Image of both Churches</span>. The book was distributed from Wesel for a learned continental readership, and from Ipswich for English readers literate in Latin. In this and his other writings at this time, Bale was trying to capitalize on the major shift in religious policy that followed Henry VIII's death in 1547 and the accession of his nine-year-old son, Edward VI, as successive governments countenanced a thorough programme of protestant reform of a kind prevented during the late king's reign. Bale's dedication of his <span class="italic">Summarium</span> appeals to Edward VI for patronage, but he failed to secure assistance from the crown until Protector Somerset's downfall in 1549 and the installation of John Dudley in his place. In certain respects, Bale's <span class="italic">Index Britanniae scriptorum</span>, an untitled manuscript that remained unpublished until the twentieth century (Bodl. Oxf., MS Selden supra 64), is a more useful bibliographical tool than his <span class="italic">Summarium</span> (or its printed successor). Mostly compiled between about 1548 and 1552, entries in this private notebook document Bale's monumental effort to record the title, opening lines, and location of every extant learned book composed by a British author.<h2>
<a name="IrelandandtheVocacyon"></a>Ireland and the Vocacyon</h2>Edward's accession enabled Bale and other reformers to return to England. In 1548 he and John Foxe are recorded as living in the duchess of Richmond's house in London. He was collated rector of Bishopstoke, Hampshire, on 26 June 1551 by John Ponet, bishop of Winchester, and in the same year was made vicar of Swaffham. Then on 15 August 1552 he met Edward VI at Southampton and was promised the Irish bishopric of Ossory; formal nomination followed on 22 October. His appointment, typical of the increasingly radical religious climate that followed Somerset's removal from office, was intended to contribute to Dudley's efforts to convert the Irish to protestantism.<br>
<br>Late in 1552 Bale travelled to Ireland, where he was consecrated at Dublin on 2 February 1553. Residing at Kilkenny, he took up his diocesan duties. Even before his installation Bale's ardent upholding of protestant doctrine had created controversy. The Irish church had not yet accepted the official &#145;Form of consecrating bishops&#146; enacted by parliament, but retained a Catholic ordination ceremony to which Bale refused to subscribe. He succeeded in his protest, but not without the disapproval and formal complaint of the dean of Dublin Cathedral.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Vocacyon of Johan Bale</span> provides a detailed account of Bale's uncompromising activity as an evangelical prelate in a remote see beyond the pale. Although the Irish bishops formally accepted the royal supremacy, they resisted changes in religion. The refusal of the conservative archbishop of Armagh, George Dowdall, to implement ecclesiastical reforms meant that traditional ceremonies remained in place. Other bishops either barely conformed or resigned their sees. Bale added to his own difficulties by trying to enforce the use of the 1552 revision of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, even though it was effectively unknown in Ireland, where the 1549 version was reprinted in 1551, a year after it had ceased to be published in England. None the less, in spite of unco-operative clergy and a generally hostile populace, his powerful sermons had made a number of converts by the time of Edward VI's death in 1553.<br>
<br>Bale's <span class="italic">Vocacyon</span>, one of the earliest known autobiographical writings in English, is largely a record of conflict between the bishop and his flock. Among the events recounted in this lively work are the poisoning of Bale's superior, Archbishop Goodacre, by a group of priests, and the murder of Bale's own servants for following his orders by working on a Catholic feast day. The text fashions Bale's identity as an uncompromising reformist bishop pitted against recalcitrant Irish clerics who, he alleges, broke their religious vows but continued to observe Catholic practices. When Mary I succeeded to the throne of England, Bale's position became precarious. Nevertheless, he stirred up further contention by the staging of his own polemical plays at the market cross in Kilkenny.<br>
<br>In the face of their bishop's opposition and continued preaching, the Irish clergy restored the mass and other prohibited religious practices. Fleeing from priests who he feared were plotting to murder him, Bale withdrew to Dublin in September 1553 and then set sail for the Netherlands. <i>En route</i> he was taken prisoner by a Flemish man-of-war, which was then forced into port at St Ives in Cornwall by bad weather. Arrested on suspicion of treason, he was released to continue his voyage, only to be arrested for a second time at Dover and held there for several weeks. Eventually, being &#145;by that time so full of lyce as I coulde swarme&#146;  (<span class="italic">Vocacyon</span>, 77), a payment of &pound;30 secured his passage to the Low Countries.<br>
<br>Bale reassures the readership of his <span class="italic">Vocacyon</span> that the persecution of English protestants under Queen Mary is only the latest bout of suffering in a cycle that will eventually lead to providential deliverance. Offering his own experience as an example of how the persecuted faithful will undergo this deliverance, Bale styles himself a martyr, not in the sense of one who dies for his faith, but as one who openly testifies to the point of death if necessary. He stresses the typological relationship between his own experiences and those of various <span class="roman">New Testament</span> figures, notably St Paul. Although the book's colophon bears the impudent joke that it was &#145;Imprinted at Rome before the sign of St Peter in December anno domini 1553&#146;, it seems likely that Hugh Singleton and Joos Lambrecht printed it at a later date in Wesel, the place of Bale's earlier exile. The false colophon helped to protect the publishers of the volume from reprisals.<h2>
<a name="Secondexilereturnanddeath"></a>Second exile, return, and death</h2>Following his landing in the Netherlands, Bale made his way to Frankfurt am Main, where in September 1554 he took part in the disputes among the English protestant exiles over liturgy and church government, eventually siding with Richard Cox and the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. He was still in Frankfurt in July 1555, when his former patron John Ponet wrote to him urging him to continue with his polemical writings: &#145;blow therfor boldly the trumnpet of Gods treuth, and play the bushop amonge your companions ther, as thoughe ye were among your flok in Yerland&#146;  (Baskerville, 443). By the end of that year he was living in Basel, where he channelled his energy into the completion of his massive bibliographical project, a revision of his <span class="italic">Summarium</span>. He laboured on this while residing at the home of the master printer Joannes Oporinus, along with his friend and fellow exile John Foxe. Under the title of <span class="italic">Scriptorum illustrium Maioris Brytannie &hellip; catalogus</span>, Oporinus published the fruit of decades of bibliographical toil in two weighty folio volumes (1557&#150;9). Like its predecessor, the <span class="italic">Catalogus</span> is divided into &#145;Centuries&#146;&#151;groupings of 100 authors. Although Bale enumerates texts regardless of their theological content, he places great emphasis on documenting the continuity of the &#145;true&#146; church from early Christian times until his generation. To this end he devotes great effort to recording the works of proto-protestant writers, notably English Lollards who looked to John Wyclif for their inspiration. Bale interspersed the entries in this catalogue of manuscripts and printed books with historical summaries that supply an apocalyptic context for texts by British authors. In 1558 Oporinus published related anti-papal material in another work by Bale, his <span class="italic">Acta Romanorum pontificum</span>.<br>
<br>Following the accession of Elizabeth, Bale returned to England, and on 10 January 1560 was appointed by the crown as canon of the eleventh prebend in Canterbury Cathedral. In the previous year Queen Elizabeth had ordered Warham and Robert St Leger, the son and brother respectively of Sir Anthony St Leger, lord deputy of Ireland, to return to Bale books and manuscripts which he had been forced to leave behind in 1553. The St Legers denied all knowledge of them, and their fate remains uncertain. None the less, Bale continued to complain to Archbishop Matthew Parker that he had not received his property. The queen had spoken for Bale on the grounds that the return of his manuscripts and continuation of his historical research was needed &#145;for the illustration and settyng forth of the storye of this our realme, by him, the said Bale&#146;  (McKisack, 18). The aged scholar was unable, however, to undertake the work envisioned by the queen. Writing nothing of great significance toward the end of his life, he did praise Elizabeth in a revised ending to <span class="italic">King John</span>. In May 1560 he was reported to be staging a play satirizing the friars in a private house in Canterbury, with a cast of schoolboys from the city's grammar school. In the following year he published his <span class="italic">Declaration of Edmonde Bonners Articles</span>, originally written in 1554, which attacks the Catholic bishop of London for persecuting protestants under Mary. He attended the convocation of 1563, but had died before 26 November that year, and was buried at Canterbury. Eight years later the fervently protestant preacher Robert Pownall asked in his will to be buried next to Bale, whose widow had in the meantime been granted a generous pension by the cathedral authorities.<h2>
<a name="Balesinfluence"></a>Bale's influence</h2>Extensive holdings of Bale's papers are preserved in the British Library, London, the Bodleian Library, Oxford, Cambridge University Library, and the Henry E. Huntington Library in California. A number of his works were collected in <span class="italic">The Select Works of John Bale</span>, published by the Parker Society in 1849. More recently, his <span class="italic">Index Britanniae scriptorum</span>, first published in 1902, was reissued in 1990, the same year in which the Renaissance English Text Society published a scholarly edition of his <span class="italic">Vocacyon</span>. Bale's edition of Anne Askew's <span class="italic">Examinations</span>, with his own commentary, was published in 1996 as part of Oxford University Press's <span class="roman">Women Writers in English</span> series. Biographical studies include works by H. McCusker (1942), L. P. Fairfield (1976), and P. Happ&eacute; (1996). The importance of the apocalyptic in Bale's thinking has been investigated by John N. King.<br>
<br>Bale's writings are indeed notable for a consistent historiographical vision which is expressed most fully in his <span class="italic">Image of both Churches</span>, but is also vital to the polemical plays, propaganda tracts, and works of scholarship written from the 1530s onwards. Above all, his interpretation of <span class="roman">Revelation</span> affords an apocalyptic paradigm for virtually everything that he wrote. In his eyes, a proper understanding of <span class="roman">Revelation</span> should enable believers to trace the historical trajectory of the conflict between &#145;true&#146; and &#145;false&#146; churches through the seven ages prophesied by the blowing of seven trumpets, the opening of the seven seals, and the pouring of the seven vials. These ages proceed from an initial period of apostolic purity to the sixth age, which encompasses the persecution of the faithful from the time of John Wyclif until Bale's own lifetime. Wyclif and William Tyndale are leading representatives of the &#145;true&#146; religion which had been brought directly to England by Joseph of Arimathea, one which remained uncorrupted by fraudulent apostolic succession of Roman pontiffs who act as agents of Antichrist. Present history looks forward to the final age, when the world as it is known will come to an end.<br>
<br>Bale was an outstanding radical reformer of the first generation of English protestants. Surviving many of his colleagues who were burnt at the stake as heretics or died in exile, he enjoyed a literary career noteworthy for his mastery of an ensemble of polemical forms, the intensity of his invective, his satirical flair, and his breadth of learning. His unparalleled acerbity earned for him the epithet (coined by Thomas Fuller) of &#145;Bilious Bale&#146;. As the standards of Elizabethan literary taste became more decorous, a process signalled by the poetic treatises of Sir Philip Sidney and George Puttenham, Bale's recourse to invective, scatological humour, and sexual innuendo alienated many English readers, and his works soon fell out of print. His apocalyptic ideas, however, exerted a continuing influence on works as diverse as John Foxe's <span class="italic">Actes and Monuments</span> (1563), book 1 of Edmund Spenser's <span class="italic">Faerie Queene</span> (1590), and Thomas Dekker's <span class="italic">Whore of Babylon</span> (1607), while the antiquarian learning contained within his comprehensive bibliographies continues to influence scholars.<br>
