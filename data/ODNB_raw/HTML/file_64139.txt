<span class="headword">Carteret <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Thynne]</span>,  Henry Frederick</span>, first Baron Carteret of Hawnes  (1735&#150;1826), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in London on 17 November 1735, younger of two sons of Thomas Thynne, second Viscount Weymouth (1710&#150;1751), landowner, and his second wife, Louisa (<i>c</i>.1712&#150;1736), daughter of John Carteret, second Earl Granville. Educated at Market Street School, Markyate, Hertfordshire, he entered St John's College, Cambridge, in 1752, and proceeded MA in 1753 and DCL in 1769. In 1756 he was a possible parliamentary candidate for Wiltshire, where his family resided, but instead came in for Staffordshire on a vacancy on 4 January 1757, backed by a family friend, Lord Gower. In 1761 he was returned on his family interest for Weobley. His elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27425/', "Thomas Thynne, third Viscount Weymouth")</script>, sought office for him, and after refusing the post of groom of the bedchamber, he accepted, in December 1762, the clerk comptrollership of the green cloth, worth &pound;1000 a year. He lost this when the Grenville ministry fell in July 1765, and acted with the opposition. Weymouth joined the duke of Bedford's &#145;gang&#146;, and Thynne regained office, as master of the household, worth &pound;518 a year, in 1768 when Bedford entered Chatham's administration. Weymouth was now a secretary of state, and Thynne was promised the Madrid embassy, but when this failed to materialize, he was awarded a pension of &pound;1000 a year. He was denied the joint vice-treasurership of Ireland in April 1770, apparently because the king was informed that he was inactive in debate. When Weymouth resigned office in December 1770, Thynne obtained the joint postmastership-general, whereupon he vacated his parliamentary seat; this appointment brought him &pound;3000 a year. He was sworn of the privy council on 19 December 1770.<br>
<br>At the Post Office, Thynne relied on the secretary, Anthony Todd, to handle his paperwork, and also turned to him for loans. In 1776 he changed his surname to Carteret on succeeding his uncle, Robert Carteret, third Earl Granville, to Hawnes Park, Bedfordshire. He was appointed high bailiff of Jersey for life. On 29 January 1784 he was created Baron Carteret of Hawnes. He gave up the Post Office in September 1789, after his brother's elevation to a marquessate. On 9 July 1810 Carteret married Eleanor Smart (1741/2&#150;1817), a spinster from Hawnes, who had been his mistress for forty-three years. They had no children, and when Carteret died at Hawnes on 17 June 1826 he was succeeded in turn by his two nephews, George and John Thynne. As both died without heirs, the barony became extinct.<br>
