<span class="headword">Pearce,  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1635&#150;1695), <span class="occ">architect and sculptor</span>, was the son of Edward Pearce (<i>d</i>. 1658), a painter and member of the Painter&#150;Stainers' Company who was employed on the interiors at Somerset House and St Paul's, Covent Garden, in London and at Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire. His father's work was accorded a favourable mention in George Vertue's <span class="italic">Note Books</span>, but most of it has been destroyed by fire. A volume of his designs for friezes, first published in 1640 and reprinted several times, was a likely source of ornament for his son's carved work, such as the staircase at Sudbury Hall, Derbyshire.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> refers to Edward Pearce junior's apprenticeship with Edward Bird &#145;the sculptor&#146;; this was possibly the Edward Bird who became upper warden of the Painter&#150;Stainers' Company in September 1656 or the William Bird who was master when Pearce was chosen of the livery in 1688. An Edward Bird appears to have had a near-monopoly of painting and gilding balls and vanes for Wren's churches, and Pearce made the models for the vanes of a number of these. In August 1680 he was paid &pound;4 &#145;for a carving of a wooden dragon for a moddell for the Vane of Copper upon the top of the Steeple and for cutting a relive in board to be proffered up to dycerne the right bignesse&#146; for the church of St Mary-le-Bow  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. B.387, fol. 125; and B.388, fol. 134<i>v</i>). &#145;Edward Pearse sonne of Mr Edward Pearse&#146; was &#145;made free by patrimony&#146; of the Painter&#150;Stainers on 16 January 1656 and &#145;chosen of the livery&#146; on 20 February 1668  (court minute book, fols. 46, 96, 285, and 333, GL, MS 5667/2/Part 1). He became a warden of the company in October 1683 and thereafter appeared intermittently as a member of the court until, on lord mayor's day 1693, he became master. This position he held for only a year, resigning perhaps through ill health on 24 October 1694. A licence was granted on 22 October 1661 to Pearce &#145;of St Botolph, Aldersgate&#146; and Anne Smith (<i>d</i>. 1703) &#145;of St Bride's, London, widow&#146; to be married at St Michael Bassishaw. In 1678 Pearce was living in the parish of St Andrew, Holborn, though in the 1680s he moved west to the redevelopment of Arundel House, south of the Strand, on which he had been engaged, and he is recorded in the rate returns for St Clement Danes' duchy liberty as resident in Arundel Street.<br>
<br>The picture that emerges from a host of references in contemporary financial records is of Pearce's thriving and wide-ranging business practice in the building boom that followed the Restoration and the great fire of London. It encompassed to an unusual degree both architectural design for ecclesiastical and domestic patronage and building contracting, with the execution of ornament in both wood and stone. Richard Crutcher (<i>c</i>.1660&#150;1725), William Beard, and William Kidwell (<i>c</i>.1664&#150;1736), who later worked in Ireland, were his apprentices. Pearce worked with the leading architects of the day. Early records of his work are a copy of his letter to Sir Roger Pratt dated 24 April 1665 concerning &#145;the Molds of ye Great &amp; lesser scroles&#146;  (Gunther, 130) and a bill for masons' work at Horseheath, Pratt's house for Lord Alington, completed in 1666. In relation to Wren, Pearce is referred to merely as the executor of the portrait bust of the latter (AM Oxf.), whereas the relationship was more complex and may have centred on a mutual regard for draughtsmanship. Pearce was one of the signatories endorsing the costs for the Monument, &#145;The Great Column of London&#146;, on the demise of the main contractor, Joshua Marshall, on 31 March 1679  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. B.363, fols. 7&#150;8 and 13). He worked with Wren on the chapel at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, supplying drawings for the ground plan, wainscot, and seats, and in July 1676 was paid &pound;2 for &#145;5 several draughts&#146;, though the work was done by Cornelius Austin  (Willis and Willis Clark, 2.707). Although not the contractor, Pearce similarly provided drawings for the front elevation of St Edmund the King, Lombard Street (1670).<br>
<br>In London Pearce was the master mason, or main building contractor, for four of Wren's churches and for parts of St Paul's Cathedral. He was sole contractor at St Lawrence Jewry from January 1670 and was paid &pound;11,870 1<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. Here he was responsible for pulling down the fire-wrecked old church and steeple, clearing the site, and laying the foundations, as well as for the overall building programme, providing labour and all the materials. He was also responsible for the detail of carved ornament. On the death of Joshua Marshall in 1679, he became joint master mason with John Shorthose to complete the rebuilding of St Clement Danes. From 1682 to 1685 he was the site contractor at St Matthew's, Friday Street, and at St Andrew's, Holborn, he was the joint contractor with William Stanton from August 1684. At St Paul's he was one of thirteen master masons, and his was one of six teams of masons. In 1678 he had the contract to build the south portico of the cathedral. On the death of Marshall construction work was divided between Pearce, Latham, and Strong, none of whom had the capital to undertake the whole programme: Pearce was responsible for the cornice in the choir. Rivalry between him and other contractors meant that he was not awarded the contract for the west end. Lang has suggested that Pearce quitted in dissatisfaction at the rates of pay, and that an unhappy relationship with Wren had developed when Pearce supported William Talman over a building disagreement at Hampton Court.<br>
<br>Correspondence for the year 1683 between William Craven and William Winde relating to the rebuilding of Combe Abbey, Warwickshire, for the earl of Craven refers to &#145;Edward Pearce the Stone Carver&#146; and his involvement in the preparations for carving the Craven coat of arms and a rebus on the site  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Gough Warwick 1, fol. 31). Drawings signed by Pearce and endorsed by Winde suggest he was responsible for both the design of the dining-room ceiling at Hampstead Marshall, Berkshire, dated 1686, and the chimney-piece of the parlour chamber at Combe Abbey. Other designs in the series, which may be attributed on stylistic grounds, indicate a greater involvement in the design of interior decoration at Combe Abbey than Pearce has hitherto been credited with. At Winchester College he appears to have been working independently on designs for the refitting of the chapel. The only complete building known to have been designed by Pearce is the former bishop's palace at Lichfield (1686&#150;7). Correspondence concerning the deanery business from Dean Addison to Archbishop Sancroft refers to the taking down of war-damaged buildings and their replacement by a house according to &#145;the model drawn by Mr Pierce&#146;, for which the ground plan and elevation survive  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 131, fol. 185<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>The full extent of Pearce's involvement with William Talman has yet to be established, but it seems to have been more extensive than scholarship has hitherto allowed. He worked with Talman at Chatsworth, Derbyshire, being named as a mason contractor in Wren's report of 1692 to the fourth earl of Devonshire on the costs of the south and east fronts, and at Hampton Court, where he was paid &pound;250 for &#145;a great Vauze of white Marble, all the figures enricht with leaves and festoons of shells, and Pedestal of Portland, likewise all members enriched&#146;, and &pound;745 10<i>s</i>. for &#145;a white great marble Urne with diverse figures and other ornaments&#146;. For the reassembling of the Diana or Arethusa fountain in the privy garden at Hampton Court he was paid &pound;1,262 3<i>s</i>.  (declared accounts, 1 May 1689 to 24 March 1696, pipe roll 4, <span class="italic">Wren Society</span>, 4, 1927, 32&#150;3). The two men clearly held each other in high esteem, and when Talman's son, John, entertained in Rome in 1711, he included Pearce in a painted pantheon, as a sculptor to vie with Glycon and &#145;Bonarota&#146;.<br>
<br>Numerous drawings, formerly attributed to William Talman and others, have been reattributed to Pearce (AM Oxf., BM, V&amp;A, and Sir John Soane's Museum, London), and a volume from the Talman series sold at Sothebys, London, on 24 April 1989 (lot 737, photographs, Courtauld Inst., Conway Library) provides an important corpus of work by him. He always signed himself Pearce, although contemporary and later documentation by others often gives his name as Pierce.<br>
<br>As with other master masons of the period, the production of church ornaments was a significant aspect of Pearce's work. While there are no known monuments signed by him, some, such as that to Margaret Vernon (1676; Sudbury, Derbyshire), are documented, while others, such as those to Viscount Irwin (<i>d</i>. 1688; Whitkirk, Yorkshire, completed by John Nost), John Withers (<i>d</i>. 1692; Arkesden, Essex), and Lady Warburton (<i>d</i>. 1693/4; St John's, Chester), have been attributed from designs in Pearce's hand.<br>
<br>Pearce's reputation as a sculptor survives on the basis of a number of individual works: a series of full-length kings and queens for the royal exchange and the Skinners', Goldsmiths' and Fishmongers' halls, the figure of William Walworth in wood (1684; Fishmongers' Hall, London), and documented busts of Dr Hamey (1675; RCP Lond.) and Thomas Evans, master of the Painter&#150;Stainers' Company (1688). The marble bust of Christopher Wren in the Ashmolean Museum is regarded as the most outstanding portrait bust in England in the second half of the seventeenth century. It was presented in 1737 to the University of Oxford by the sitter's son, who, in a letter to George Vertue in 1742, gave it a date of 1673 and an attribution to Pearce. A marble bust of Oliver Cromwell (AM Oxf.), while inscribed &#145;E. Pierce Fecit&#146;, has had a convincing case made against its being by Pearce, and it is likely to have been made later in the next century. A clay head of Milton (Christ's College, Cambridge) has all the veracity of a contemporary portrait, but the attribution to Pearce is late and hopeful.<br>
<br>Pearce died in Arundel Street, Strand, London, in March 1695 and was buried at St Clement Danes. He was survived by one son, John, and a daughter, who married John Killingworth; both were beneficiaries, with his widow, of his will, dated 2 July 1694. Probate was granted on 20 April 1695. It is clear that Pearce was a man of substance. His portrait and that of his wife were, according to his son, &#145;of Mr Fuller's Painting&#146;, and he collected works of art. In his will Pearce stated that &#145;Mr William Tallman Comptroller of their Majesties works my very good friend to whom I have ben much oblidged&#146; was &#145;to have ye Choise &amp; picking of what therin shall seeme to make up ye worthy Collection he intends&#146;  (will, LMA, x001/160). The drawings Talman chose became part of the distinguished collection amassed by John Talman, which subsequently lost their provenance and with it their attribution, to the detriment of Pearce's reputation. The &#145;sirpluss of my Clositt&#146;, a collection &#145;of Books, Drawings, Prints, models &amp; Plaster Figures&#146;, was sold with that of Mr Manby in January&#150;February 1696  (Poole, 36).<br>
