<span class="headword">Unwin,  Thomas Fisher</span>  (1848&#150;1935), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born on 24 January 1848 at 33 Lowgate Hill, London, the son of Jacob Unwin (1802&#150;1855), and his wife, Isobel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hall. He was born into a family of printers and publishers: his father had founded the Gresham Press, and his mother was from the Miller family, who had published the <span class="italic">Cheap Magazine</span>. He attended the City of London School, and in 1892 married Jane Cobden (1851&#150;1947) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38683/', "Unwin, (Emma) Jane Catherine Cobden")</script>], daughter of the politician Richard Cobden.<br>
<br>After serving with Jackson, Walford, and Hodder, Unwin started his own London business in 1882 in Holborn Viaduct, buying Marshall, Japp &amp; Co. for &pound;1000. He established himself at 11 Paternoster Building in 1883. Annual profits averaged between &pound;600 and &pound;700 until about 1900, and the firm moved to Adelphi Terrace in 1905. By 1912 the business had expanded so much that it was taking in profits of &pound;6000, and in 1920 it became a company. Unwin was considered generous to unknown writers but was notorious for refusing to increase the pay of those whose careers took off, and so although he published some of the most experimental writers of the period, many of them eventually left Unwin when they became famous: H. G. Wells, John Galsworthy, Somerset Maugham, Joseph Conrad, George Moore, and Ford Madox Ford. Unwin also first published the work of several aesthete poets and playwrights, including John Davidson, May Crommelin, Graham Rosamund Tomson, and Katharine Tynan. The risk of publishing unknown writers was balanced by the republishing of popular writers; Unwin handled colonial editions for publishers and acted as author's agent, serializing fiction for publication in the United States, for a 10 per cent commission.<br>
<br>What distinguished the firm of Unwin was its publication of many series and its launching of new writers. Series ranged widely in subject from popular literature (prose and poetry), to history, to current politics and social issues of the day. The <span class="roman">Pseudonym Library</span> was a series of eighteen-pence books, stiff-covered and paper-bound, and its writers included John Oliver Hobbes (Pearl Craigie), John Buchan, Mrs Humphry Ward, Edith Nesbit Bland, William Henry Hudson, Mark Rutherford (William Hale White), Vernon Lee (Violet Paget), Ouida (Louise de La Ram&eacute;e), and Ethel M. Dell. Never one to flinch from controversy, Unwin also published the first novel of Olive Schreiner, <span class="italic">Trooper Peter Halket of Mashonaland</span> (1897), which attacked the British South Africa Company, and accused Cecil Rhodes of murdering Matabele (Ndebele) envoys.<br>
<br>The <span class="roman">Story of the Nations Library</span>, to which distinguished historians contributed, reflected Unwin's interests in foreign writers, liberalism, free trade, international affairs, and in combating the persecution of minorities. These books also reflected his wife's interests in abolition and suffrage. He published historical and political subjects by controversial writers such as Wilfrid Scawen Blunt. Unwin, who was pro-Boer, saw through publication the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> (1902) of former South African President Stephanus Kruger. He also supported the Aborigines Protection Society, publishing E. D. Morel's <span class="italic">Red Rubber</span> (1906, 1907). His press also issued Annie Besant's <span class="italic">Autobiography</span> (1893), Freud's <span class="italic">The Psychopathology of Everyday Life</span> (1914) and <span class="italic">Wit and its Relation to the Unconscious</span> (1916), works by Karl Besant, and translations of Russian novels by Constance Garnett.<br>
<br>Many of Unwin's interests are evident from his publishing lists, but they are also seen in his many memberships and affiliations. He was not only a joint founder of the Publishers' Association (1896) but he was also joint founder and treasurer of the Friends of Russian Freedom and a member of the South African Conciliation Committee. He served both as treasurer of the library committee and chair of the political and economic circle for the National Liberal Club; he was also vice-president of the West Sussex Liberal Association, and governor of Dunford House (Cobden Memorial). His commitment to public service can been seen, too, in his founding of the Johnson Club, his treasurership of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/45600', "Cobden Club")</script>, and his serving at various points as governor of Johnson House, the London School of Economics, and Carlyle House.<br>
<br>By 1917 Unwin's firm had published twenty-seven series, including the <span class="roman">Autonym Library</span>, <span class="roman">Independent Novels</span>, the <span class="roman">Welsh Library</span>, the <span class="roman">Idle Hours</span> series, the <span class="roman">Children's Library</span>, and the <span class="roman">Literary History</span> series. Unwin's <span class="roman">First Novel</span> series included <span class="italic">Whose Body?</span> by Dorothy L. Sayers (1912). The <span class="roman">New Irish Library</span>, co-published with Sealy, Bryers, and Walker in Dublin, published works by W. B. Yeats. The <span class="roman">Reformer's Bookshelf</span> series issued <span class="italic">The Political Writings of Richard Cobden</span>, and Edward Carpenter's controversial <span class="italic">Towards Democracy</span> (1892). The <span class="roman">Mermaid</span> series reprinted rare Jacobean and Restoration plays in new scholarly editions costing half a crown; participating editors included Havelock Ellis (general editor), J. A. Symonds, A. C. Swinburne, Ernest Rhys, Edmund Gosse, Herbert Horne, and Arthur Symons.<br>
<br>The firm's periodicals also exemplify the internationalism that Unwin promoted in line with his liberalism and interest in world politics: <span class="italic">Revue Bleue</span>, <span class="italic">Independent Review</span> (October 1903 to March 1907), and <span class="italic">Compolis: an International Review</span> (1896&#150;8). The latter was edited by F. Ortmans and featured such writers as Andrew Lang, W. Lebknecht (a close friend of Marx and Engels), G. B. Shaw, Henry James, Yeats, Conrad, George Gissing, Rudyard Kipling, George Meredith, Anatole France, Israel Zangwill, Tolstoy, and Edmund Gosse.<br>
<br>Unwin himself was tall and upright in bearing; family members commented on his distinguished stature and characteristic erect carriage, and he was described by his nephew Philip Unwin variously as looking &#145;as if his neck and torso were encased in plaster&#146;  (P. Unwin, 39), and looking &#145;like a horse with a bearing rein&#146;  (ibid., 3). His irascible personality was well known in the publishing business, as were his sometimes eccentric habits, such as spitting in public. Although he was not really athletic, he had a keen interest in mountaineering, and once climbed the Matterhorn. His dress was consistent throughout his life, including his floppy, yellow bow-tie; even in old age he sported a full beard, and his piercing blue eyes lost none of their clarity. Unfortunately his publishing business lacked his vigorous stamina, and its final years were marked by financial decline. In 1926 Unwin retired to his Sussex home, and the firm merged with Ernest Benn Ltd. Unwin died of bronchitis on 6 February 1935 at his home, Oatscroft, Heyshott Road, Midhurst, Sussex.<br>
