<span class="headword">Wright,  Francis Beresford</span>  (1806&#150;1873), <span class="occ">iron manufacturer</span>, was born on 21 December 1806, probably in Derbyshire, the second son in the family of three sons and four daughters of John Wright (1758&#150;1840) of Lenton Hall, Nottinghamshire, ironmaster, and his wife, Elizabeth. His father was co-founder of the iron manufacturing Butterley Company, and his mother was the daughter of another co-founder, Francis Beresford of Osmaston, near Ashbourne.<br>
<br>Little is known of Wright's early years, but in 1830, on the retirement of his father, he became the senior partner in Butterley, which he dominated for the next forty-three years. He applied himself to business with intense seriousness of purpose. &#145;Ad rem&#146; was his family's motto. On 12 August 1830 Wright married Selina, daughter of Sir Henry FitzHerbert, baronet, of Tissington Hall, Derbyshire. They had five sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>The company prospered under Wright's direction, and by the time of his death Butterley was the biggest industrial concern in Derbyshire and one of the greatest in the country. The company had been valued in 1830 at &pound;30,000; by 1858 its capital stood at &pound;436,000. The original coal and iron concerns of Butterley were expanded, and engineering work was undertaken for the railways. The company constructed Vauxhall Bridge over the Thames, the railway bridge at Trent Junction, and the railway viaduct over the Derwent. Perhaps Wright's success is best symbolized by the construction in 1869 of the roof of St Pancras Station, a 240 foot tied arch of cast iron, weighing 9000 tons, with no intermediate structure, probably then the largest single span of its kind in the world.<br>
<br>The outward sign of Wright's success was the building of a great country house, Osmaston Manor, outside Ashbourne, in 1846&#150;9. Measuring 333 feet by 192 feet, it had stables for seventeen horses, rooms for twenty servants, a brewhouse, a bakehouse, and a central tower standing 150 feet high. It was said to be the first house since Roman times to have central heating: over 3 miles of piping were used but there was no chimney in the house itself. A hydraulic lift ran up the mansion's four storeys. It was the showpiece of the county. A parapet round the clock bore the significant words &#145;Work while it is Day&#146;.<br>
<br>Wright was a high-minded evangelist who made Butterley into a model employer. The company organized a sick fund for its workers and built, at Ironville, a school for about two hundred of their children. Among Wright's many charitable actions was the building of the church of St Martin at Osmaston (because he disapproved of the high-church tendencies of the parish church) and the founding of Trent College in 1866, one of whose houses was named after Wright. A chapel there was built in his memory in 1875. His puritanical streak led him as lord mayor to attempt to ban the &#145;demoralizing pleasure fair&#146; in Ashbourne and to outlaw Shrovetide football.<br>
<br>Francis Wright was a magistrate, high sheriff of Nottinghamshire (1842), a fine horseman, and a lover and planter of trees. He died on 24 February 1873 at Osmaston Manor and was buried in Osmaston parish church.<br>
