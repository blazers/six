<span class="headword">Otway, Sir  Robert Waller</span>, first baronet  (1770&#150;1846), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, the second son of Cooke Otway of Castle Otway, co. Tipperary, and Elizabeth, daughter of Samuel Waller of Lisbrian, co. Tipperary, was born in Ireland on 26 April 1770. His father intended him for an army career, but he entered the navy as a midshipman in April 1784 on the <i>Elizabeth</i>, guardship at Portsmouth, with Captain Robert Kingsmill. Between 1785 and 1789 he served twice in the Mediterranean, in the <i>Phaeton</i> and then the <i>Trusty</i>, before going in the <i>Blonde</i> to the West Indies, where, and off the coast of Africa, he remained in different ships until promoted into the brig <i>Falcon</i> as lieutenant on 8 August 1793. In December he was appointed to the <i>Impregnable</i> (98 guns), bearing the flag of Rear-Admiral Benjamin Caldwell. When the <i>Impregnable's</i> fore-topsail-yard was badly damaged in the battle of 1 June 1794, Otway, accompanied by a midshipman, went aloft and secured it so that the ship remained under control, for which Caldwell publicly thanked him. Caldwell took Otway as his first lieutenant in the <i>Majestic</i> when appointed commander-in-chief in the West Indies, and in the following January he promoted him to the command of the sloop <i>Thorn</i> (confirmed by the Admiralty 7 August 1795).<br>
<br>In April Otway captured <i>La Belle Cr&eacute;ole</i>, a large schooner sent from Guadeloupe by Victor Hugues (who had been sent to capture Guadeloupe by the French Jacobin government). The schooner was sent to burn St Pierre, Martinique, whose royalist inhabitants gratefully presented Otway with a gold-hilted sword valued at 200 guineas. In May the <i>Thorn</i> (16 guns, 80 men) captured the sloop <i>Courrier National</i> (18 guns, 119 men) after a thirty-five minute action in which Otway and five of his crew were wounded  (James, 1.321). He afterwards rendered important assistance against the insurgents in St Vincent and Grenada, and on 30 October 1795 was posted by Sir John Laforey, the new commander-in-chief, to the frigate <i>Mermaid</i>. In her, and afterwards in the <i>Ceres</i> and the <i>Trent</i>, he had an exceptionally adventurous and successful career. He played an important part in the capture of Grenada in 1796. In July 1799 he narrowly escaped capture in a daring raid into La Guayra, on the coast of Venezuela, in pursuit of the frigate <i>Hermione</i>. In his six years in the West Indies he was said to have captured or destroyed 200 enemy privateers or merchantmen. The <i>Trent</i>, in 1799 and 1800, &#145;is supposed to have made as many captures as ever fell to the lot of one vessel in the same space of time&#146;  (Brenton, 2.448). He earned his success, which made him rich, by intelligent ship management. Admiral Sir Thomas Ussher, a lieutenant on the <i>Trent</i>, declared that no captain was more attentive to the comfort of his officers and men and that there was so much method in his manner of carrying on the service that, though in a constant state of activity, they had as much leisure as any other ship's company. Without unnecessary display of polished bolts or nail heads, the <i>Trent</i> was the most perfect man-of-war on the station, ready to go into action in five minutes. Every rope and spar was kept in place and the decks clear. Otway inspected each gun after exercise and ensured it was ready and clear of encumbrance. Ussher added that Otway always accompanied his boats on dangerous raids but hid this in his reports where he gave the credit to his officers.<br>
<br>In November 1800 the <i>Trent</i> returned to England with the flag of Sir Hyde Parker, who took Otway as his flag captain in the <i>Royal George</i>, and, in February 1801, in the <i>London</i>, when Parker took command of the fleet sent to break the armed neutrality of the Baltic powers. It is said, apparently on Otway's authority, that it was at his suggestion that the fleet advanced against Copenhagen through the Sound (between Zealand and Sweden) instead of by the Great Belt (between Zealand and F&uuml;nen). During the battle which followed, when the commander-in-chief determined to hoist the celebrated signal to &#145;discontinue the action&#146;, Otway, opposing the signal, obtained permission to go to Admiral Nelson to ascertain his situation. He was sent home with dispatches, and, returning in August, was appointed to the <i>Edgar</i>, serving in the Baltic, the channel, and the West Indies, returning in July 1802. In late 1801 he married Clementina Holloway (<i>d</i>. 20 Oct 1851), eldest daughter and coheir of Admiral John Holloway: they had five sons and six daughters. His two eldest sons, both commanders in the navy, predeceased him.<br>
<br>Ill health and a severe domestic calamity prevented Otway from joining the <i>Culloden</i> at the resumption of hostilities in 1803, but during 1804&#150;5 he commanded the <i>Montagu</i>, under Charles Cornwallis, off Brest, engaging the <i>Alexandre</i> in the dash at the French fleet on 22 August 1805. In the spring of 1806 he was part of Sir Richard Strachan's command in pursuit of the French squadron under Willaumez. In 1807 he was sent to the Mediterranean, where he served on the coast of Calabria, and in 1808 on the coast of Catalonia in co-operation with the Spanish patriots. After bringing the <i>Malta</i> to England, he returned in May 1809, commanding the <i>Ajax</i>, and then the <i>Cumberland</i>, in the blockade of Toulon and the French coast. In December 1811 his health failed and he was compelled to invalid. In May 1813 he returned to the <i>Ajax</i>, in the channel and the Bay of Biscay. In autumn he co-operated with the army in the siege of San Sebastian, and early in 1814 he convoyed a fleet of transports to Quebec, afterwards assisting in equipping the flotilla on Lake Champlain.<br>
<br>On 4 June 1814 Otway was promoted rear-admiral, and from 1818 to 1821 was commander-in-chief at Leith, Scotland. On 8 June 1826 he was made a KCB and appointed commander-in-chief in South America, where his watchfulness and tact at a time of political turmoil led the Brazilian government to award him its order of the Southern Cross. He returned to England in 1829. On 22 July 1830 he was promoted vice-admiral and on 15 September 1831 was created baronet. Groom of the bedchamber to both William IV and Victoria, he was promoted admiral on 23 November 1841 and was made a GCB on 8 May 1845. He died suddenly on 12 May 1846; his third son, George Graham Otway, succeeded him as second baronet, and his fourth son, Sir Arthur John Otway, as third baronet.<br>
<br>Ralfe's comment that &#145;[Otway] is one of the fortunate few who have no enemies, no detractors, none who will admit a hint or insinuation to his disparagement&#146; was backed by successive commanders. &#145;There is not an officer in his Majesty's navy of greater zeal and promise&#146;, wrote St Vincent, recalling particularly how well Otway preserved the <i>Montagu's</i> masts and spars in the Bay of Biscay in 1806, and Cornwallis declared that &#145;there is no officer whose services I should have preferred either as a captain or as admiral&#146;  (Ralfe, 4.19&#150;20, 24).<br>
