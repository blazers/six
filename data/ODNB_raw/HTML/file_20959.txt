<span class="headword">Outram,  Benjamin</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1764, <em>d.</em> 1805), <span class="occ">civil engineer and ironmaster</span>, was born at Alfreton, Derbyshire, where he was baptized on 1 April 1764, the eldest son of Joseph Outram (1732&#150;1811), a local freeholder, and his second wife, Elizabeth. His father practised as a land agent and served as a turnpike trustee and enclosure commissioner; the tradition that he also had an ironworks at Ripley is unfounded. While he was still very young, Benjamin (who was probably named after an uncle who died in 1741, rather than the American Benjamin Franklin, as sometimes claimed) attracted the attention of Francis Beresford, a local attorney and a member of a leading west Derbyshire gentry family, who appears to have helped with his education and training. Outram became a land surveyor and both he and his father were early promoters of the Cromford Canal, authorized in 1789, which ran from the Erewash Canal at Langley Mill to Cromford and Pinxton, passing within a few miles of the Outrams' home at Alfreton.<br>
<br>While the canal was being built, a freehold estate of about 200 acres became available along its route at Butterley, between Alfreton and Ripley, which in 1790 Beresford bought in his own name and Outram's. Here Outram established an ironworks and within a few years the business had expanded to include a limestone quarry and limekilns, with collieries and ironstone pits spread over a wide area around Butterley Hall. In 1792 Beresford and Outram were joined by John Wright, a Nottingham banker who married Beresford's eldest daughter, and William Jessop (1745&#150;1814), principal engineer of the Cromford Canal, of which Outram was resident engineer, and the four men together established Benjamin Outram &amp; Co., with a nominal capital of &pound;6000. Outram took up residence at Butterley Hall and was the only partner active in the management of the company, in which he was assisted by a younger brother, Joseph.<br>
<br>In addition, Outram built up a considerable civil engineering practice following his success with the Cromford Canal, completed in 1793. In Derbyshire he was responsible for the Derby and Nutbrook canals in the south-east of the county and the much more ambitious Peak Forest Canal in the north-west; further afield he was engineer to the Huddersfield Canal. He also reported on several schemes which did not go ahead.<br>
<br>More important than his canal work was Outram's contribution to the development of railways. Cast-iron rails had begun to replace wooden track after their first use at Coalbrookdale in 1767, and in 1787&#150;8 a new type of L-section rail, with a flat tread and vertical inside flange, in place of rails designed to take wagons with flanged wheels, was introduced underground at Sheffield and on the surface at Wingerworth ironworks, near Chesterfield. Outram took up the idea of plate rails, as they became known, improved their design, and became the leading promoter of their use in many parts of the country, especially the east midlands and south Wales. In some cases he acted as engineer for canal companies seeking to build tram road branches; elsewhere he merely supplied rails made at Butterley ironworks, which thus became one of the country's main producers of castings of this sort outside south Wales. On the other hand, the notion that the words &#145;tram&#146; or &#145;tram road&#146; are derived from Outram's name has long been dismissed as untenable.<br>
<br>In 1800 Outram married Margaret (1778&#150;1863), daughter of the Scottish political economist and writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/475/', "James Anderson (1739&#150;1808)")</script>, with whom he had five children: Francis, Anna, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20962/', "James Outram")</script>, Margaret, and Elizabeth. Shortly afterwards he gave up most of his engineering commitments to devote more time to managing the works at Butterley, which by this date already employed more than 500 men. On 22 May 1805, however, while on a visit to London, Outram died after only a few days' illness, apparently from a stroke (his wife uses the phrase &#145;brain fever&#146;). His sudden death, without leaving a will, led to the discovery of considerable confusion in his affairs and his dealings with the Butterley Company, as the business became known in 1807. Only in 1815, after four years of chancery litigation, was the partnership reconstructed and Mrs Outram released from obligations incurred by her husband. She returned to her native Aberdeen in 1810 with her children, of whom the second son, James Outram (1803&#150;1863), was made a baronet in 1858 for his part in suppressing the Indian mutiny. She never remarried.<br>
<br>Evidence from the extensive surviving records of the Butterley Company confirms the view of Benjamin Outram&#151;suggested by the letters and journals of his wife&#151;that he was a man of great vigour and spirit, characteristics shared by his father, Joseph, with whom he did not get on. Mrs Outram wrote:<blockquote>My husband like many other men of great talent and comprehensive and generous mind, was hasty in his temper, feeling his own superiority over others. Accustomed to command, he had little toleration for stupidity and slowness, and none for meanness or littleness of any kind. (Outram, 101)</blockquote>A temperament of this sort enabled Outram to create the largest coal, iron, and engineering business in the east midlands in barely fifteen years, while at the same time transforming the way in which railways were built. It also led to a situation in which his wife and family, far from benefiting from his success as both ironmaster and engineer, were reduced to near poverty when the rashness of some of his actions became clear after his death.<br>
