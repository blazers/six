<span class="headword">Woodall,  William</span>  (1832&#150;1901), <span class="occ">politician</span>, elder son of William Woodall of Shrewsbury and his wife, Martha Basson, was born in Shrewsbury on 15 March 1832 and educated at the Crescent Schools, Liverpool. He entered the business at Burslem of James Macintyre, china manufacturer, whose daughter Evelyn (<i>d</i>. 1870) he married in 1862; they had no children. On Macintyre's death in 1870 he became senior partner in the firm. He was also chairman of the Sneyd Colliery Company.<br>
<br>Woodall was active in local affairs, devoting himself especially to the cause of technical education. He was chairman of the Burslem school board (1870&#150;80), of the Wedgwood Institute there, and of the North Staffordshire Society for Promotion of the Welfare of the Deaf and Dumb. He sat on royal commissions on technical education (1881&#150;4) and the care of the blind and deaf mutes (1886&#150;9). In September 1897 he accompanied Sir Philip Magnus and others to Germany to study technical instruction methods there.<br>
<br>Woodall was Liberal MP for the borough of Stoke-on-Trent, 1880&#150;86, and was first representative of Hanley from 1885 to 1900. He was a strong supporter of home rule, disestablishment, and local veto, as well as of the extension of the franchise.<br>
<br>In 1884 Woodall succeeded Hugh Mason (MP for Ashton under Lyne) as leader of the women's suffrage group in the Commons, and introduced (10 June) an amendment to the <span class="roman">Representation of the People Bill</span> to provide that &#145;words having reference to the right of voting at parliamentary elections, importing the masculine gender, include women&#146;. As chairman of the Central Committee for Women's Suffrage (established in 1872), he headed a memorial from 110 members to Gladstone, but the prime minister resisted the amendment as likely to imperil the bill. The division was taken on 12 June 1884, when 135 voted with Woodall and 271 against. In obedience to a strong party whip, 104 Liberal supporters of the women's cause voted with the majority: had they voted according to their convictions the amendment would have been carried by 72 votes instead of being lost by 136. On 19 November Woodall brought in a bill granting the vote to single women on the same terms as men, but the second reading was four times adjourned and it never reached a division. Under Gladstone's short third administration of 1886 Woodall was surveyor-general of the ordnance. He revived a bill for women's suffrage in July 1887, and after further delays he reintroduced it in April 1889 and again in 1891. He accepted office as financial secretary to the War Office (August 1892 to June 1895) in Gladstone's fourth government.<br>
<br>Woodall presented to Burslem a large wing to the Wedgwood Institute and free library, besides founding the Woodall Liberal Club there and bequeathing a collection of valuable pictures to the art gallery. He wrote for various magazines and reviews, republishing some articles in <span class="italic">Paris after Two Sieges</span> (1872). He was a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. He died at the house of his nephew-in-law, Dr Woodhouse, 2 South Parade, Llandudno, on 8 April 1901. The Woodall Memorial Congregational chapel at Burslem was built in 1906.<br>
