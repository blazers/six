<span class="headword">Davids,  Thomas William</span>  (1816&#150;1884), <span class="occ">ecclesiastical historian</span>, born at Swansea on 11 September 1816, was the only child of William Saunders Davids, minister of the Congregational church meeting in Providence Chapel, Swansea, and his wife, Bridget, daughter of Thomas Thomas of Vrowen in the parish of Llanboidy, Carmarthenshire. He was a descendant of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14992/', "David Jones (1736&#150;1810)")</script>, rector of Llan-gan, Glamorgan, the &#145;Wesley of Wales&#146;. Thomas's father died in December 1816, and his mother in 1831; the orphan was adopted by his uncle, Thomas Thomas of Llanbedr Felffre, a man of considerable means. For some years Davids was educated for the medical profession, but in 1835 he decided to become an Independent minister. In 1836 he entered the old college at Homerton, then under John Pye Smith, and there studied for the ministry, until in 1840 he was invited to become minister of the Congregational church meeting in Lion Walk at Colchester in Essex.<br>
<br>In 1841 Davids married Louisa, the daughter of Robert Winter, solicitor, of Clapham Common. They had ten children, among them the orientalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32726/', "Thomas William Rhys Davids")</script>. Under her superintendence the Sunday school attached to his church soon became known as a model, and after its transfer to new and extensive premises she published in 1847 an essay entitled <span class="italic">The Sunday School</span>. It was awarded a prize offered by the committee of the Sunday School Union, passed rapidly through four editions, and was for some years regarded as the standard textbook on the management and organization of similar institutions among all denominations. Following Louisa's death in 1853, Davids remarried, on 28 April 1859; his new wife was Mary, the daughter of William Spellman of Norwich.<br>
<br>Davids had marked success as a minister. The church became too small for the congregation, and it was through his efforts that the new Gothic church in Lion Walk was built. He also devoted much attention to the organization of his denomination within the county, and for many years was secretary of the Essex Congregational Union and the Home Missionary Society.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Davids had given such time as he could spare to the study of the religious history of Essex. In connection with the bicentenary celebration of the eviction of the nonconforming clergy in 1662, he was asked in 1862 to prepare a memorial of those who were evicted in Essex. He devoted immense labour to this volume, searching the Essex parish registers, the Public Record Office, the British Museum, Dr Williams's Library, and elsewhere, for all references to the puritans settled in Essex at the time of the eviction and to the previous religious history of each parish in the county. The more important results of his researches appeared in the <span class="italic">Annals of evangelical nonconformity in the county of Essex from the time of Wycliffe to the Restoration, with memorials of the Essex ministers ejected or silenced in 1660&#150;1662</span> (1863). But the bulk of his genealogical, parochial, and other collectanea remained unpublished in six folio volumes, which, frequently added to and carefully indexed, were purchased, after his death, for the library of the Congregational Memorial Hall (now administered by Dr Williams's Library). The minute details of the personal and family history of the early puritans contained in the published volume were of special interest in America, and the author was elected an honorary corresponding member of the New England Historic Genealogical Society.<br>
<br>A larger question, however, began increasingly to occupy Davids's time. While searching in each case for the direct or indirect sources of the puritan belief held by the evicted clergy, the author was led to the opinion that there had been an unbroken tradition of so-called evangelical belief stretching back to a period long before the time of Wyclif and Hus, and probably even to the earliest beginnings of Christianity. The task of tracking this undercurrent of belief throughout Europe occupied his retirement after his resignation from ministerial work in 1874. His <span class="italic">Annals of Reformers before the Reformation</span> were never completed. However, Davids did contribute numerous articles to Smith's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Christian Biography</span>, and a paper entitled &#145;Evangelical nonconformity under the first of the Plantagenets&#146; was published in the <span class="italic">British Quarterly Review</span> (September 1870).<br>
<br>Davids died at 4 St George's Square, Upton, Essex, of heart disease on Good Friday, 11 April 1884, and was buried in Colchester.<br>
