<span class="headword">Blennerhassett, Sir  Rowland</span>, fourth baronet  (1839&#150;1909), <span class="occ">journalist and politician</span>, born at Blennerville, co. Kerry, on 5 September 1839, was the only son of Sir Arthur Blennerhassett, third baronet (1794&#150;1849), and his wife, Sarah, daughter of John Mahony. His only sister, Rosanna (<i>d</i>. 1907), became a Red Cross nurse. Both parents were Roman Catholics. Rowland succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father in 1849. After being educated first at Downside School, under the Benedictines, and then at Stonyhurst College, under the Jesuits, he matriculated in 1859 at Christ Church, Oxford, but left, without taking a degree, for the University of Louvain. There he took a doctor's degree in political and administrative science, &#145;with special distinction&#146;. He afterwards, in 1864, studied at Munich, where he formed a lifelong friendship with J. J. I. von D&ouml;llinger. Finally he proceeded to Berlin, where he became acquainted with many leading politicians, including Bismarck. A frequent visitor to France, he came to know the chief figures of all parties under the Second Empire.<br>
<br>About 1862 Blennerhassett became intimate with Sir John Dalberg (afterwards Lord) Acton, with whose stand against later developments of ultramontanism he had a strong sympathy. The discontinuance by Acton in April 1864 of the <span class="italic">Home and Foreign Review</span>, a Roman Catholic organ of Liberal tendencies, suggested the possibility of establishing a journal the main objects of which should be political and literary; and Blennerhassett found the money for starting <span class="italic">The Chronicle</span>, a weekly newspaper, under the direction of T. F. Wetherell. Blennerhassett and Acton were of great service in searching for competent foreign correspondents. The first number appeared on 23 March 1867, and the last on 13 February 1868. As Gladstone predicted, it proved too Roman Catholic for Liberals, and too Liberal for Roman Catholics, and its early support of home rule for Ireland further prejudiced its chances of success. Save on ecclesiastical questions, the paper seldom expressed Blennerhassett's opinions. <span class="italic">The Chronicle</span> lacked sympathy with the reasoned imperialism which developed out of Blennerhassett's early admiration of Bismarck and engendered a faith in the superiority of German to British methods of progress. His early desire that Britain should learn from Germany passed into a strong desire that the country should prepare itself for the rivalry which the new German ambitions were making inevitable. Thus with him foreign policy grew to be an absorbing interest.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Blennerhassett took an active part in Irish politics. In 1865 he became Liberal MP for Galway City, a seat that he retained until 1874. But he lost the confidence of the priesthood, owing to his association with D&ouml;llinger and Acton (although he remained Roman Catholic) and his vote on the <span class="roman">Irish University Bill</span> of 1873. From 1880 to 1885 he represented County Kerry, his native county. (He should not be confused with his fellow member and cousin Rowland Ponsonby Blennerhassett.) In that interval his attitude on the home-rule controversy changed completely. A lukewarm supporter of home rule as a parliamentary movement under Butt and Shaw, he actively opposed it as a national movement under Parnell. Defeated in the Harbour division of Dublin city at the general election of November 1885, he did not re-enter the House of Commons.<br>
<br>During his parliamentary career Blennerhassett was mainly concerned with Irish university education and the Irish land question. His speeches on Fawcett's <span class="roman">Irish University Bill</span> in 1871, and on Gladstone's <span class="roman">Irish University Bill</span> of 1873, which he supported, showed an intimate knowledge of continental universities. He regretted Gladstone's exclusion of religiously divisive subjects, modern history and moral philosophy, from the curriculum, and pressed the system&#151;borrowed from Germany&#151;of two denominational faculties in the same university. In 1872 he moved the second reading of a bill for the purchase of Irish railways. In regard to the land question, he anticipated the legislation of 1903 in a confidential memorandum, dated April 1884 (afterwards printed), suggesting the appointment of a commission to convert large tracts of Irish land into peasant properties, by buying the estates of landlords willing to sell, at twenty-two years' purchase of the judicial rent.<br>
<br>After his retirement from the House of Commons Blennerhassett continued to play a part in Irish public life. He was a commissioner of national education and a member of the senate of the Royal University. From 1890 to 1897 he was an inspector of reformatory and industrial schools; from 1897 to 1904 he was president of Queen's College, Cork; and in 1905 he was sworn of the Irish privy council. During these years he constantly wrote on political subjects in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>, the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Deutsche Rundschau</span>, and, especially at the end of his life, in the <span class="italic">National Review</span>. Blennerhassett published several of his speeches in parliament and his inaugural address on <span class="italic">University Education</span> at Queen's College, Cork, in 1898. He edited Ringhoffer's <span class="italic">Bernstorff Memoirs</span> in 1908. He deeply regretted the change to intransigence in papal policy on the election of Pius X, though he admitted the provocation given by the French legislation against the church, and the difference between the modernism of the 1900s and the liberal Catholicism of his youth. A ready talker as well as writer, Blennerhassett died on 22 March 1909 at 54 Rutland Gate, London, and was buried at Downside.<br>
<br>On 9 June 1870 Blennerhassett married Countess Charlotte von Leyden, daughter of Count von Leyden, of an old Bavarian family, whom he had first met in Rome four months earlier. <a name="cosubject_47572"></a><span class="headword">Charlotte Julia Blennerhassett</span>, Lady Blennerhassett  (1843&#150;1917), <span class="occ">was a well-known historian and the author of several books</span>, notably a life of Madame de Sta&euml;l (1889). Like her husband, she had studied with D&ouml;llinger and enjoyed a close intellectual relationship with Acton, who recruited her as a contributor to the <span class="italic">Cambridge Modern History</span>, for which she wrote two articles on nineteenth-century Catholicism. The Blennerhassetts had two sons, of whom Arthur Charles Francis Bernard succeeded to the baronetcy; an only daughter, Marie Carola Franciska Roselyne, married Baron Raphael d'Erlanger.<br>
