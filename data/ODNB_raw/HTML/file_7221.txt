<span class="headword">Davidson,  Thomas Randall</span>  (1747&#150;1827), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born Thomas Randall at Inchture, Perthshire, in July 1747, the son of <a href="#cosubject_70844">Thomas Randall [<i>see below</i>]</a> and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1775), daughter of Thomas Davidson, minister at Dundee. The elder <a name="cosubject_70844"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Randall</span>  (1711&#150;1780), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and religious writer</span>, was minister first at Inchture and then at Stirling. He compiled an important collection of tracts on the subject of ecclesiastical patronage, and wrote a significant pamphlet on church communion and a noted sermon (1763) on Christian benevolence, all major subjects of discussion within the popular or evangelical party within the church. Through his father, the younger Thomas thus inherited a considerable standing among leading ministers of the popular party. He was educated at the University of Leiden, and on 14 June 1769 he was licensed at Rotterdam, where his maternal uncle William Davidson was a prominent merchant within the large Scots commercial community. When his father was translated to Stirling, Thomas the younger succeeded him at Inchture on 21 February 1771. He was translated to the Outer High Church of Glasgow on 18 November 1773, to Lady Yester's in Edinburgh on 26 November 1778, and to the Tolbooth Church in Edinburgh on 9 June 1785, where he remained for the rest of his career. Upon the death of William Davidson in 1794, he inherited his uncle's property of Muirhouse in Cramond, near Edinburgh, and assumed his surname.<br>
<br>Compared to the writings of his father, Davidson's were neither prolific nor especially influential. He was the author of three sermons preached on public occasions between 1775 and 1802, as well as a funeral sermon preached in 1803 upon the death of his fellow minister John Erskine. These sermons were known more for their polish and the benevolence of their sentiments than for any striking originality.<br>
<br>Davidson married twice. His first wife was Christian, daughter of John Rutherford of Edgerton, whom he married on 29 January 1772; she died on 6 July 1797. His second wife was Elizabeth, daughter of Archibald Cockburn, baron of the exchequer, whom he wed on 20 August 1798. He had three children with his first wife and six with his second. Davidson died on 25 October 1827; Elizabeth lived on until 30 March 1850.<br>
<br>Davidson was described in a contemporary publication as &#145;a sound, practical and zealous preacher&#146;  (Kay, 1.388&#150;90). He was known to contemporaries as an evangelical and benevolent clergyman who put forth a cultured and respectable image for the popular party. His reputation for benevolence secured for him an honorary doctorate of divinity from Harvard University in 1793. Davidson's career is notable for illustrating the extent to which evangelical ministers of the later eighteenth century, including such contemporaries as Henry Moncreiff Wellwood, were able to transcend an earlier reputation for crudeness and a lack of polish, and establish themselves as polite men of letters and well-connected gentlemen.<br>
