<span class="headword">Beecham,  Thomas</span>  (1820&#150;1907), <span class="occ">manufacturer of patent medicines</span>, was born at Curbridge, Oxfordshire, on 3 December 1820, the eldest of three sons and four daughters of Joseph Beecham, an agricultural labourer, and his wife, Sarah, daughter of James Hunt. He received a year's schooling before becoming a shepherd's boy at the age of eight. For the next twelve years as a shepherd, he educated himself and acquired herbal lore. From 1840 onwards he undertook casual work at Kidlington, where for a time he acted as village postman and sold in nearby markets some pills of his own invention, whose main constituents were powdered aloes and powdered ginger and which acted as a mild purgative.<br>
<br>In 1847 Beecham migrated to Liverpool, where, on 26 May of that year, he married Jane Evans (1811/12&#150;1872) from Bangor, north Wales, who was eight years his senior. They had two sons and two daughters. Shortly after the marriage they settled in Wigan, where he made and marketed his pills. After his chemist's shop failed, the family moved to St Helens in 1859. In time, a combination of pertinacity and persuasiveness brought Beecham success. Using the slogan &#145;Worth a guinea a box&#146;, he began to advertise his pills in the local press, and gradually created a network of wholesale agents, mainly in London and towns in Lancashire and Yorkshire. In 1865, having set up a small workshop, and with the help of his elder son, Joseph, he achieved an annual turnover of &pound;2500. Within fifteen years he had multiplied this to &pound;23,000 and was completing his first purpose-built factory.<br>
<br>In contrast to his single-mindedness in business, in his private life Beecham was a persistent philanderer; he callously inscribed the name of an illegitimate daughter (<i>b</i>. 1862) in the family <span class="roman">Bible</span>. After not a few publicly aired rows and scandals, his wife left him; she died of drink in 1872. In January of the following year he married Sarah, daughter of Henry Pemberton, a London labourer; although she was thirty years younger than Beecham, she died in 1877. In September 1879 Beecham married 28-year-old Mary Sawell, daughter of James Putt, contractor, and already three times widowed. Having been brought up in Canterbury, she detested St Helens, and coerced Beecham into moving in 1881 to Mursley Hall, Buckinghamshire. There at first he relished the novelty of country-house life, but discord soon erupted, and relations collapsed after his wife accused him of having tried to poison her. An acrimonious separation followed, and in 1884 he returned to St Helens.<br>
<br>By this time, Beecham's son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46614/', "Joseph Beecham")</script>, was very much in control of the firm, and in 1886 opened a grand new factory. Thomas occupied himself in writing letters to the press which yielded valuable free publicity. In 1893, having visited the world fair in Chicago, he retired to a newly built villa at Southport. Living alone with a Welsh housekeeper, Jane Roberts, in 1895 he was presented by her with a daughter. That year he handed over the whole business to Joseph. He died at his home, Wychwood, 2 Norwood Avenue, Southport, of pulmonary congestion, on 6 April 1907; he was buried at Dent Green cemetery, St Helens. His estate was valued at &pound;86,680 gross.<br>
<br>Short, squat, and with a shock of white hair, unkempt beard, and piercing blue eyes, Beecham customarily wore an antique frock coat, paper collar, and hard round hat. His grandson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30670/', "Sir Thomas Beecham")</script>, remembered with awe his voluminous trousers hitched well up to the chest, many-hued, and of rough, thick material. Beecham's manners were as off-putting as his rustic appearance. Seldom if ever going into society and entirely unselfconscious, he scandalized his genteel daughter-in-law with his coarse eating habits, yet few women could resist his powerful sexual magnetism. He gave idiosyncratically to good causes. In later life he became a Congregationalist. As a founding entrepreneur, he lacked the largeness of vision to create a giant business: this task he left to his son Joseph.<br>
