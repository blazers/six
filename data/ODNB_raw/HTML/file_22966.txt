<span class="headword">Quincy,  Roger  de</span>, earl of Winchester  (<em>c.</em>1195&#150;1264), <span class="occ">constable of Scotland</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22967/', "Saer de Quincy, earl of Winchester (d. 1219)")</script>, and Margaret de Breteuil, younger daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1883/', "Robert de Breteuil, earl of Leicester (d. 1190)")</script>. Roger had four brothers and three sisters. His elder brother, Robert, died in 1217; with his wife, Hawise, sister of Ranulf (III), earl of Chester (<i>d</i>. 1232), he had one daughter, Margaret, who was passed over in the succession to the earldom of Winchester in favour of Roger. His younger brother, also named Robert, married Helen, daughter of Llewelyn ab Iorwerth, prince of Gwynedd (<i>d</i>. 1240), and widow of John the Scot, earl of Chester and Huntingdon. Of his sisters, Hawise married Hugh de Vere, earl of Oxford, and Arabella married Sir Richard de Harcourt. Roger himself married three times: first Helen, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49362/', "Alan")</script>, lord of Galloway and constable of Scotland; second Maud, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2775/', "Humphrey (IV) de Bohun, earl of Hereford (d. 1275)")</script>; and third Eleanor, daughter by his first marriage of William de Ferrers, earl of Derby, by whom he was survived. According to Matthew Paris, he contracted his third marriage in haste, hoping for a male heir, but his only children were the three daughters of his first marriage: the eldest, Margaret, married William de Ferrers, sixth earl of Derby, as his second wife [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54521/', "Ferrers family (per. c.1240&#150;1445)")</script>]; the second, Elizabeth (or Isabella), married Alexander Comyn, earl of Buchan (<i>d</i>. 1289); and the youngest, Helen, married Alan de la Zouche (<i>d</i>. 1270).<br>
<br>Little is known of Roger de Quincy before 1219. He was probably the son whom Saer delivered to King John in 1213 as a Scottish hostage for the security of the Anglo-Scottish treaty of 1212. He emerged onto the political stage in 1215 when, along with Saer and the leaders of the baronial rebellion against John, he was excommunicated by Innocent III (<i>r</i>. 1198&#150;1216), but did not figure prominently in the civil war that followed the king's death. He perhaps accompanied his father on crusade in 1219, and apparently did not return to England until some considerable time after Saer's death at the siege of Damietta in that year, for it was not until 1221 that Roger did homage to Henry III and received his father's lands. He did not receive the title of earl until after his mother's death in 1235.<br>
<br>The death in 1234 of his father-in-law, Alan of Galloway, led to a considerable expansion of Roger de Quincy's already substantial estates in both Scotland and England. Galloway and Alan's extensive Scottish properties were divided in right of their wives between Quincy, who as husband of the eldest daughter received also the office of constable of Scotland, John de Balliol of Barnard Castle (<i>d</i>. 1269), and William de Forz, future earl of Aumale (<i>d</i>. 1260). The refusal of Alexander II, king of Scots (<i>r</i>. 1214&#150;49), to accede to Galwegian requests that he allow instead the lordship to pass intact to Thomas, bastard son of Alan, or to another male relative, or himself assume direct lordship over Galloway, provoked a rebellion in 1235 in support of Thomas. On its suppression by Alexander, partition among the husbands of Alan's daughters was enforced. Further disturbances in Galloway followed the death in 1246 of Quincy's sister-in-law, the childless Christina, countess of Aumale, and division of her lands among her surviving sisters. A rebellion in 1247, which Matthew Paris attributed to Quincy's oppressiveness, trapped him in one of his Galloway castles, probably Cruggleton in Wigtownshire which belonged to his Comyn heirs later in the century, but he succeeded in escaping to the Scottish court. There he was successful in soliciting Alexander's aid in crushing the rebellion.<br>
<br>Notices of his involvement in Galloway apart, there is no evidence for Roger de Quincy's fulfilling a role in Scotland commensurate with his landed position. Despite his holding the office of constable he played no part in Alexander II's campaign in Argyll in 1249, nor in the crisis of 1263 when Haakon IV of Norway mounted his expedition to the Hebrides in response to Scottish threats to the Norwegian possessions there. The survival of a considerable body of his <i>acta</i> and confirmations of his grants by the Scottish crown, however, demonstrate that he was frequently resident in Scotland. His appointment in 1257 by Henry III of England as a commissioner to arbitrate between Alexander III and the leaders of the Comyn and Durward factions in Scotland on the one hand underscores his lack of active involvement in Scottish politics, while on the other it stresses his influential position as a major Anglo-Scottish nobleman.<br>
<br>Roger de Quincy did not hold the prominence in politics that his father had commanded in England either, but his wealth secured him an important role. In 1239 and 1246 he joined in written remonstrances from the English nobility to Gregory IX (<i>r</i>. 1227&#150;41) and Innocent IV (<i>r</i>. 1243&#150;54) concerning papal interference in English affairs. Association with the stirrings of dissatisfaction with the government of Henry III expressed in the parliaments of 1248 and 1254 led to identification with the baronial opposition in 1258. At the Oxford parliament Quincy was elected by the barons to the twelve-member commission charged with attendance at the three annual parliaments provided for under the provisions of Oxford, and was appointed also to the committee that arranged the financial aid promised to Henry. In 1259 he led a delegation to St Omer to intercept Richard, earl of Cornwall (<i>d</i>. 1272), and forbid him to return to England until he had sworn to observe the provisions of Oxford. This appears to have been Roger de Quincy's last major act, for he played little part in subsequent events which culminated in open conflict between the king and his baronial opponents, and died on 25 April 1264, eighteen days after Henry had precipitated the country into civil war. At his death he was probably the greatest Anglo-Scottish landowner of his day, holding not only one of the largest agglomerations of land in baronial hands, but one with estates spread from Perthshire in the north to the channel coast in the south. With only daughters to succeed him, however, these extensive lands were ultimately divided among their husbands, and the title of earl of Winchester lapsed.<br>
