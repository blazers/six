<span class="headword">Kelly <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fordyce; <em>other married name </em>Hedgeland]</span>,  Isabella</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1759, <em>d.</em> 1857), <span class="occ">poet and novelist</span>, was born at Cairnburgh Castle and baptized on 4 May 1759, the youngest of the three daughters of William Fordyce of Aberdeen, and his wife, Elizabeth Fraser (<i>d</i>. 1785), niece of Alexander Fraser, Lord Strichen. Her grandfather William Fordyce of Anchorthies was a figure of scandal: a successful merchant and sometime baillie of Aberdeen, he was eventually convicted for his part in a kidnapping ring. Her parents were both cut off by their wealthy families, following a clandestine marriage in the early 1750s. Her father served with the Royal Marines, was promoted to captain by 1761, and later became groom of the bedchamber to George III, though in time he fell from favour at court.<br>
<br>In December 1789 Isabella married Robert Hawke Kelly, the son of Colonel Robert Kelly of the East India Company. The younger Kelly had served in Madras before his marriage, and he apparently died there by 1807 with the rank of major. In 1794 Isabella Kelly published her first book, a <span class="italic">Collection of Poems and Fables</span>, although if her claim that &#145;[s]everal of the pieces&#146; in it &#145;were written before &hellip; her fourteenth year&#146;  (p. iii) is true, she had started writing much earlier. Kelly had by that time suffered &#145;a variety of domestic calamities&#146;  (ibid.), including&#151;if the poems are read autobiographically&#151;marital unhappiness, possible desertion by her husband, and the death of a child.<br>
<br>In an attempt to support her surviving children, Kelly began writing Gothic fiction, publishing her first novel, <span class="italic">Madeline</span>, in 1794, and writing nine more between 1795 and 1811. The novels, which are full of both Gothic paraphernalia and fashionable sentiment, were moderately successful; the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> thought <span class="italic">Madeline</span> &#145;entitled to a decent rank in the circulating libraries&#146;  (Kelly, <span class="italic">Abbey of St Asaph</span>, viii), and Kelly's later work received some aristocratic patronage. In addition to her fiction, Kelly wrote educational books, including a French grammar for children, and a rather eccentric collection of miscellaneous information, <span class="italic">Instructive Anecdotes for Youth</span> (1819), which is dated from the King's Road, Chelsea.<br>
<br>Kelly received financial support from Monk Lewis, who paid for the education and upbringing of her elder son, the spendthrift William Henry Martin Dillon Kelly (<i>b</i>. 1795); the latter assumed the name William Horace Keppell and became an actor in North America. She also spent some time as a governess to the Lonsdale family. On 22 May 1809 she married a wealthy merchant, Joseph Hedgeland, with whom she had a daughter. Her husband lost money in commercial speculations and died in January 1812, aged thirty-seven. In 1819 her son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15295/', "Sir Fitzroy Kelly (1796&#150;1880)")</script> entered Lincoln's Inn and subsequently enjoyed a distinguished legal career. Her last book, <span class="italic">A Memoir of the Late Mrs. Henrietta Fordyce</span>, was published anonymously in 1823, perhaps in an attempt to silence rumours that she had taken advantage of a generous elderly relative. She received grants from the Royal Literary Fund in 1828 and 1830. Said to have been ninety years old in 1849, she died at 20 Chapel Street, Belgrave Square, London, on 25 June 1857 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
