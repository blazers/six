<span class="headword">Cockerell,  Samuel Pepys</span>  (1753&#150;1827), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born (according to the diary of his son C. R. Cockerell), on 6 January 1753, at Bishop's Hull, Somerset, the son of John Cockerell (1714&#150;1767) and his wife, Frances Jackson (<i>d</i>. 1769). His mother was the daughter of John Jackson of Clapham, nephew and heir of Samuel Pepys, and from her Cockerell inherited many interesting relics of the great diarist. His brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47774/', "Charles Cockerell MP (1755&#150;1837)")</script> of Sezincote, Gloucestershire, who was created a baronet in 1809. Samuel Cockerell received his architectural training from Sir Robert Taylor, whom he later remembered in his will as &#145;the affectionate prop and support of my early steps and to whom &hellip; I was chiefly indebted for my first advancement in life&#146;.<br>
<br>Cockerell, whose practice was in London, held a succession of public appointments through his career. In 1774 he was appointed district surveyor for the parish of St George's, Hanover Square. In 1775 he obtained the post of clerk of works at the Tower of London in the office of works, and in 1780 he was made clerk of works at Newmarket; both these office of works posts were lost when the department was reorganized in 1782. In 1785 he was appointed inspector of repairs to the Admiralty, and when Sir Robert Taylor died in 1788 Cockerell succeeded him as surveyor of the Foundling and Pulteney estates in London. In 1791 he became surveyor to the victualling office. He was diocesan surveyor for Canterbury and London, and surveyor of St Paul's Cathedral (1811&#150;19). For the Foundling Hospital, Cockerell prepared plans for the development of their Bloomsbury estate; building went on from 1790 to 1805. Some of the governors of the hospital were dissatisfied with Cockerell's supervision of the project and tried to have him dismissed. Though ultimately not held responsible, he resigned in 1808. Cockerell also prepared plans for the development of the bishop of London's Paddington estate, which were only partly implemented when he died in 1827; the scheme was eventually completed to a new design by his successor as surveyor, George Gutch. In addition, Cockerell had a fairly extensive private practice.<br>
<br>In his architecture Cockerell showed no consistent approach to design but produced work in several styles. Although it is not known whether he ever visited the continent, some of his designs give hints of French influence: his church at St Martin Outwich, London (1796&#150;8; dem. 1874), the fa&ccedil;ade of Gore Court, Kent, for G. Harper (1792&#150;5; dem. <i>c</i>.1925), and the unusual tower of St Anne's, Soho (1802&#150;3), were examples. Banbury church, Oxfordshire (rebuilt 1792&#150;7), had an interior inspired by Sir Christopher Wren's St Stephen Walbrook and Sir Robert Taylor's Bank of England transfer office. At Tickencote in Rutland he made a &#145;serious if not very scholarly attempt&#146;  (Colvin, <span class="italic">Archs</span>., 262) to restore the twelfth-century church in Romanesque style. At Sezincote and Daylesford, both in Gloucestershire, he famously incorporated oriental architectural forms in English houses for patrons who had made their fortunes in East Indian trade. The Indian style was popularized through the drawings of Thomas and William Daniell, whose volume <span class="italic">Oriental Scenery</span> was collected together and published in 1808. It provided useful source material for &#145;nabobs&#146; and for Cockerell himself, who was surveyor to the East India Company from 1806 to 1824. Daylesford House, remodelled for Warren Hastings, from 1789 to 1793, had oriental hints only in the top of its dome; but Sezincote House, which he designed (<i>c</i>.1805&#150;20) for his brother Sir Charles Cockerell, was in full-blown Indian style, and it is thought to have influenced the prince regent (later George IV), who visited it about 1807, in his remodelling of the Royal Pavilion, Brighton.<br>
<br>Cockerell first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1785, sending some designs for ornamental structures in the park of White Knights in Berkshire. He did not exhibit again until 1792, from which year up to 1803 he was a frequent contributor, chiefly of designs for mansions and churches. Among other houses designed by him were Middleton Hall, Carmarthenshire, for Sir William Paxton (1793&#150;5; dem. 1951), the austerely neo-classical Nutwell Court, near Exeter, for the second Baron Heathfield (1802), and Toft Hall, Cheshire, where in 1810&#150;13 he added a dining-room, library, and twin towers for Ralph Leycester.<br>
<br>Cockerell lived at the house at the corner of Savile Row and Burlington Street; he designed a house for himself at 29 North Side, Clapham Common, but in 1800 he moved to Westbourne Lodge, Paddington (once the home of the architect Isaac Ware). He married Anne, daughter and coheir of John Whetham of St Ives, Huntingdonshire; they had six sons and five daughters; his second son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5781/', "Charles Robert Cockerell (1788&#150;1863)")</script>, also an architect. Cockerell's pupils, apart from his son Charles, were many, and included Joseph Kay, Benjamin Latrobe, Thomas Martyr, James Noble, William Porden, Robert Sibley, and C. H. Tatham. He died at Westbourne Lodge on 12 July 1827.<br>
