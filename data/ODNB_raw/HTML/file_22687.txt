<span class="headword">Poynter,  Ambrose</span>  (1796&#150;1886), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 16 May 1796 in London, the second son of Ambrose Lyon Poynter and Thomasine Anne Peck. The family was of Huguenot origin, his father's great-great-grandfather Thomas Pointier of St Quentin in France having settled in England in 1685. Poynter's architectural education was thorough: pupillage between 1814 and 1818 in the office of John Nash, then foreign travel in 1819&#150;21, in Italy, Sicily, and the Ionian Islands. In 1821 he attended out of courtesy the funeral in Rome of Keats, whom he did not know. A few years after returning to Britain, Poynter set up in practice at 1 Poet's Corner, Westminster. In 1830&#150;32 he lived in Paris, where his associates included Richard Parkes Bonington, Baron Denon, the engraver Boucher-Desnoyers, and others. From about 1846 his London house and office were at 12 Park Street (later 1 Queen Anne's Gate). He married, in 1832 at the British embassy chapel in Paris, Emma (1800&#150;1848), daughter of the Revd E. Forster and Lavinia, the only child of the sculptor Thomas Banks. With her he had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35600/', "Sir Edward John Poynter")</script>, president of the Royal Academy, and three daughters, of whom Clara, wife of Robert Courtenay Bell, attained distinction as a translator [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98433/', "Bell, Clara")</script>]. Emma died in 1848, and in 1850 Poynter married Louisa Noble (<i>d</i>. 1874), the daughter of General Robert Bell, with whom he had a daughter.<br>
<br>Poynter was closely involved in the development of the architectural profession. One of the founder members of the Institute of British Architects in 1834, he was an early member of its council, and in 1840, 1841, and 1844 served as its secretary. He read markedly diverse papers at its meetings, and in 1842 his anonymous essay &#145;On the general introduction of iron in buildings&#146; won the institute's silver medal; despite this interest, however, Poynter's numerous buildings demonstrate no particular precocity or adventurousness in the use of iron. He also contributed papers to the proceedings of the Archaeological Institute, of which he was an original member. He was frequently employed on arbitration cases, notably in 1844&#150;55 as one of three official referees appointed under the <span class="roman">Metropolitan Building Act</span>. Deteriorating eyesight from 1858 compelled him to retire by 1860; several commissions then in hand were completed by William Burges.<br>
<br>Poynter was chiefly an architect of churches and country houses. His best-known London work is the Tudor Gothic-style hospital and chapel of St Katharine in Regent's Park (1827); other London churches, Christ Church, Westminster (1841), and the French protestant church in Bloomsbury Street (1845), have been demolished. Elsewhere the greatest concentrations of his work are in Cambridge and Flintshire in north-east Wales. In Cambridge he is said to have built early in his career an observatory for his friend the mathematical &#145;coach&#146; William Hopkins (1793&#150;1866). Between 1837 and 1843 he built three Cambridge churches, St Paul's, Christ Church, and St Andrew the Great, and in 1835 he competed unsuccessfully for the building of the Fitzwilliam Museum. In Flintshire he built churches, schools, and houses, many of them, including Mostyn Hall (1846&#150;7), for the first Lord Mostyn. Of other country houses his work at Pynes House, Devon (1849, for Sir Stafford Northcote), is significant; restorations or additions to Warwick Castle (1830&#150;31) and Crewe Hall were destroyed by fire during Poynter's lifetime. His other restoration schemes include Waltham Abbey, Essex (1851&#150;<i>c</i>.1855), and the Maison Dieu, Dover (begun 1858). In his later career he was architect to the National Provincial Bank of England, for which he designed several premises. Poynter's buildings are competent but rarely inspired essays in the conventional Renaissance and (especially) English medieval idioms of the day, in which he was content to follow rather than lead; his Cambridge churches fell foul of the fashion for more accurate imitation of medieval forms, however, for which he was ridiculed by <span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span>  (2, 1843, 137).<br>
<br>Poynter's architectural draughtsmanship was exceptionally fine, and he was also an accomplished watercolourist, having studied under Thomas Shotter Boys. His papers include extensive notes and fine drawings of English medieval architecture, made in the later 1820s, apparently with a view to publication. However, his most widely read writings were articles on literature, science, and art in Charles Knight's mass-market <span class="italic">Pictorial History of England</span> (1837&#150;44); he also provided illustrations for the work, and for Knight's edition of Shakespeare (1838&#150;41). He was an original member of the Arundel Society and the Graphic Society, and an amateur of heraldry.<br>
<br>Poynter was also involved with the government schools of design. In 1845&#150;8 he served as a somewhat undistinguished inspector of the provincial schools, then run as satellites of the main school in Somerset House, London. His chief shortcoming was the failure effectively to modernize their curricula to accommodate the claims of commercial design. For this and for his contradictory official reports he was accused in 1849 of slackness and duplicity in the <span class="italic">Journal of Design</span>, a mouthpiece of the reformer Henry Cole  (2, 1849, 142&#150;5). Although Poynter served on successive reforming committees in 1848&#150;51, it was Cole who effectively reorganized the schools thereafter. Poynter died at his home, 3 Marine Place, Dover, on 20 November 1886, and is presumed to have been buried at Kensal Green, London, where he had bought a plot.<br>
