<span class="headword">Maitland,  Charles</span>  (1815&#150;1866), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born at Woolwich in Kent, on 6 January 1815, the eldest son of Charles David Maitland (1785&#150;1865) and his wife, Elizabeth Adye Miller, and nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17830/', "General Sir Peregrine Maitland")</script>. His father was at one time a captain in the Royal Artillery, and served with some distinction at the end of the Napoleonic wars. After graduating BA in 1824 from St Catharine's College, Cambridge, however, he was ordained and for the last forty years of his life was minister of St James's Chapel at Brighton. Like many others in the early nineteenth century, he took up the study of biblical prophecy, writing two works on the subject, probably while still in the army, and pursuing his interest in it when he became a minister. This interest was obviously passed on to his son, Charles, who was educated first at a large private school at Brighton, and afterwards, when he chose medicine for his profession, in the house of a general practitioner in London. He studied in Edinburgh for three years, and graduated MD in 1838, the title of his inaugural essay being &#145;Continued fever&#146;. After visiting Malta, Italy, Greece, and Egypt in company with a patient, he returned to England and was admitted an extra-licentiate of the London College of Physicians in July 1842. On 5 November 1842 he married Julia Charlotte [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48645/', "Maitland, Julia Charlotte (1808&#150;1864)")</script>], writer and traveller, widow of James Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1840), an Indian judge in the Madras presidency. Her maiden name was Barrett, and her mother was a niece of Fanny Burney, Madame D'Arblay.<br>
<br>Maitland practised for a few years at Windsor, but his interests drew him more towards theology. He matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford in 1848, graduated BA (with a second class in classics) in 1852, and was ordained deacon in the same year, and priest the following year. He was at first curate at All Saints, Southampton, then at Lyndhurst, Hampshire, and afterwards in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire. But his mind gave way, and after being for some years separated from his family, he died at his home, 81 Upper Stamford Street, London, on 26 July 1866, and was buried in the Brompton cemetery.<br>
<br>While at Rome, Maitland was attracted to the catacombs, and, being a good amateur artist, made numerous drawings. In 1846 he published <span class="italic">The church in the catacombs: a description of the primitive church of Rome, illustrated by its sepulchral remains</span>; a second revised edition followed in 1847. This was apparently the first popular book on the subject, and reflected Maitland's opinion that the Roman church of his day bore little resemblance to that of the Apostolic era. In 1849, while at Oxford, he published <span class="italic">The Apostles' School of Prophetic Interpretation: with its History Down to the Present Time</span>. This work was clearly premillennial in outlook, although Maitland was somewhat critical of the futurists of that time for what he perceived to be their relative lack of interest in early church figures such as Barnabas and Irenaeus. In this emphasis he appears to have differed somewhat from his father, whom he none the less cited in his study with considerable approval.<br>
