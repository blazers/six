<span class="headword">Kratzer,  Nicolaus</span>  (<em>b. </em>1486/7, <em>d.</em> after 1550), <span class="occ">astronomer and maker of scientific instruments</span>, was born in Munich, probably the son of a saw smith, named Hans. The date of his birth can only be deduced from a portrait by Hans Holbein the younger from 1528 (Paris, Louvre), which bears the inscription &#145;Imago ad vivam effigiem expressa Nicolai Kratzeri monacensis qui Bavarus erat quadragesimum primum annum tempore illo complebat 1528&#146; (&#145;Live portrait of Nicholas Kratzer of Munich in Bavaria, done in 1528 when he was forty-one&#146;).<br>
<br>Kratzer was probably trained in his father's craft. He left his native town for Cologne and matriculated at the university there on 18 November 1506, and took his BA in 1509. Then he went to the University of Wittenberg. During the following years Kratzer probably practised instrument making, but until his arrival in England in 1517 or 1518 almost nothing is known except the fact that about 1515 he copied out some astronomical treatises in the Carthusian monastery of Maurbach, near Vienna. The purpose of his move to the court of Henry VIII is shrouded in mystery, but the background was obviously known to Erasmus of Rotterdam and his correspondents. In 1517 Peter Giles wrote to Erasmus that Kratzer was on his way to England with astrolabes, armillary spheres, and a Greek book. In 1520 Kratzer, now called &#145;deviser of the King's horologes&#146;, was given leave of absence for a diplomatic mission. In Antwerp he became acquainted with Albrecht D&uuml;rer, who made a silver-point portrait of him, now lost. How long Kratzer stayed in the Low Countries is not certain, but in the spring of 1521 he was in the service of Thomas More, then treasurer of the exchequer, in England. It has been frequently stated that in 1517 Kratzer was among the first fellows of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, but there are no contemporary references extant. That he stayed in the town is certain, but his status in the university is open to considerable doubt. On his own evidence he was lecturing at the king's command on elementary astronomy, the construction of the astrolabe, and Ptolemy's geography. Probably, like his colleague, the Spanish humanist Juan Luis Viv&egrave;s, he was one of Cardinal Wolsey's lecturers residing at Corpus. Between 11 February and 23 March 1523 Kratzer was incorporated, first as BA, then as MA.<br>
<br>When on 21 April 1521 the assembly of divines under the chairmanship of Cardinal Wolsey condemned Luther's doctrines, Kratzer was commissioned to commemorate the event by erecting a sundial outside St Mary's Church, together with a notice on the condemnation by the Oxford divines. (This dial survived until 1744, but disappeared during rebuilding of the church wall.) Soon after his arrival in Oxford in 1521 Kratzer made another dial which stood in the orchard of Corpus. It was a polyhedral dial combined with a hemispherical dial on the upper surface of a carved stone, topped with a spherical dial supported by iron arches. This dial vanished before 1710, but Robert Hegge, a fellow of Corpus enthusiastic about sundials, had made a description and executed a drawing which is preserved in the college library. A portable dial made for Cardinal Wolsey and resembling in shape and function the stone dial in Corpus is preserved in the Museum for the History of Science at Oxford, and recently a fragment of a stone dial has been attributed to Kratzer.<br>
<br>Concerning his activities as an astronomer, it seems that Kratzer was mainly engaged in making scientific instruments (especially sundials), although in 1529 Kratzer, Hugh Bozvell, and Hans Bour were sent to Cornwall to survey the King's woods and mines, and to try to smelt the ore. Whether he was responsible for the construction of the dial for an astronomical clock at Hampton Court palace executed by the French clockmaker Nicolas Oursian is not certain. Two manuscripts by Kratzer are extant. One is a set of instructions for an instrument which he called <i>horoptrum</i>, the other is a collection of treatises on scientific instruments copied by Kratzer when he stayed in Maurbach. They deal with portable sundials, ring dials, the cross-staff, the &#145;new&#146; quadrant of Profatius, the celestial globe, the astrolabe, and equatoria for calculating planetary positions. While this is not original, Kratzer made at least one unique design for an adjustable vertical dial with a semicircular scale which may be classified as a compound solar instrument.<br>
<br>Hans Holbein the younger was greatly interested in time and horology, and he and Kratzer became intimate friends. In the portrait of 1528 Kratzer is depicted as a maker of astronomical instruments surrounded by rulers, compasses, and sundials. Some of these instruments also appear on the famous double portrait of the French ambassador Jean de Dinteville and his friend George de Selve, painted by Holbein in 1533 (London, National Gallery). In the representation of scientific instruments Holbein certainly relied on instructions given to him by Kratzer, and there is good reason for thinking that Kratzer collaborated with the artist in the overall esoteric design of the painting. When he was about fifty Kratzer married, his wife's name being Christiana; they had at least one daughter. In the preface to Guido Bonatti's <span class="italic">Tractatus de astronomia</span> (1550), edited by Nicolaus Prugner, then professor for astronomy in T&uuml;bingen, Kratzer is mentioned. In all probability he died shortly afterwards, since no reference to him after Prugner's preface has been found. Some of Kratzer's books passed into the possession of John Dee and Richard Forster, physician to the earl of Leicester.<br>
