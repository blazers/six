<span class="headword">Poole <span class="st"> [Pole]</span>,  Matthew</span>  (1624?&#150;1679), <span class="occ">biblical commentator</span>, son of Francis Pole and Mary Topham, was born at York and baptized on 6 December 1626 at St Cuthbert's Church. His father was descended from the Poles or Pools of Spinkhill, Derbyshire; his mother was a daughter of Alderman Matthew Topham of York, and he had one elder and two younger sisters. He was admitted at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 2 July 1645, under the tutelage of John Worthington DD. He graduated BA at the beginning of 1649 and succeeded Anthony Tuckney DD in the sequestered rectory of St Michael-le-Querne. This parish was then in the fifth classis of the London province, under the presbyterian church government introduced a few years previously by parliament. This was Poole's only preferment. He proceeded MA in 1652, and on 14 July 1657 he was one of eleven Cambridge graduates incorporated MA at Oxford on the occasion of the visit of the university chancellor, Richard Cromwell.<br>
<br>In 1654 Poole became one of the first Englishmen to publish a work attacking the opinions of the Unitarian John Biddle, in a tract entitled <span class="italic">The Blasphemer Slain with the Sword of the Spirit, or, A plea for the Godhead of the Holy Spirit &hellip; Against &hellip; Biddle</span>. It was the first of many controversialist publications produced by Poole. In 1658 he published a scheme for a permanent fund to support the university studies of young men of promise seeking entry into the ministry. The plan was approved by John Worthington and Anthony Tuckney, and had the support also of John Arrowsmith DD, Ralph Cudworth, William Dillingham DD, and Benjamin Whichcote. The fund raised about &pound;900, and it appears that William Sherlock, afterwards dean of St Paul's, received assistance from this fund during his studies at Peterhouse, Cambridge, until 1660, when he graduated BA. Those entrusted with administering the fund sent Poole regular reports on students interviewed and the ratings they had received in philosophy, logic, and languages. The scheme was abandoned at the Restoration.<br>
<br>Another plan devised by Poole that proved stillborn was his &#145;Designe for registring of illustrious providences&#146;. This was an ambitious project to co-ordinate reports of instances in which God's providence was observed, to verify the accounts and collect accounts for future publication. The idea was transported to North America and enacted by Increase Mather in the early 1680s.<br>
<br>Poole was a <i>jure divino</i> presbyterian, and probably an authorized defender of the views on ordination of the London provincial assembly as formulated by William Blackmore. In 1658 he published a work entitled <span class="italic">Quo warranto, or, An Enquiry into the &hellip; Preaching of &hellip; Unordained Persons</span>, which may have been written some years earlier, as the assembly does not seem to have met after 1655. In this tract Poole systematically refuted the arguments advanced in defence of preaching by lay persons, and maintained that the activity was the exclusive preserve of ministers.<br>
<br>In 1659 Poole printed a letter to Lord Charles Fleetwood, a key figure in the government of Richard Cromwell, which was delivered to him on 13 December. In this letter he expressed his sentiments regarding the current state of national affairs. Following the Restoration, in a sermon delivered on 26 August 1660 before the lord mayor of London, Sir Thomas Aleyn, at St Paul's, Poole issued a plea for simplicity of public worship, anticipating a return to Laudian practices loathed by presbyterians. On the passing of the <span class="roman">Uniformity Act</span> in 1662 he resigned his living rather than subscribe to the new church order, and was succeeded by R. Booker on 29 August 1662. In a work published four years later, <span class="italic">Vox clamantis in deserto</span>, he delivered his highly unfavourable view of the current ecclesiastical situation. The government of Charles II identified him as a potential troublemaker in the early years of the Restoration. Although he delivered a number of sermons during this period, Poole seems to have made no attempt to gather a congregation. He had a patrimony of &pound;100 a year, providing him with sufficient income. He was one of those who presented to the king &#145;a cautious and moderate thanksgiving&#146; for the declaration of indulgence of 15 March 1672, and who were hence offered royal bounty: Gilbert Burnet reports, on the authority of Edward Stillingfleet, that Poole received a pension of &pound;50 a year for two years. Early in 1675 Poole participated with Richard Baxter in negotiations for comprehension, promoted by John Tillotson, which proved fruitless. According to Henry Sampson MD, Poole developed plans for a nonconformist ministry and day school at Tunbridge Wells, Kent.<br>
<br>In 1666 Poole printed the first of two publications against the Roman Catholic religion. In a work entitled <span class="italic">The Nullity of the Romish Faith</span> he defended the protestant faith from Catholic denunciations and refuted the doctrine of papal infallibility. The following year he published <span class="italic">A Dialogue between a Popish Priest and an English Protestant</span>, in which a dialogue was conducted concerning the principal points and arguments of both faiths. Unsurprisingly, the conclusions reached were distinctively unfavourable to the Roman Catholic position. This work was frequently reprinted, into the nineteenth century. Poole's wife, about whom nothing is known, died in 1668 and was buried on 11 August at St Andrews Holborn. The funeral sermon was preached by Edward Stillingfleet.<br>
<br>Despite his refusal to subscribe to the Restoration church order, Poole developed amicable relations with leading ecclesiastics. It was on the suggestion of one of these, William Lloyd, ultimately bishop of Worcester, that Poole undertook the great work of his life, the <span class="italic">Synopsis criticorum aliorumque sacrae scripturae interpretum</span>, a synopsis of the critical labours of biblical commentators. He commenced his studies for the project in 1666, and took ten years to complete it. During this time he would rise at three or four in the morning, take a raw egg at eight or nine, and another at twelve, and continue at his studies until late in the afternoon. He frequently spent evenings at the house of a friend, commonly that of Henry Ashurst. Here &#145;he would be exceedingly but innocently merry&#146;, though he always ended the day in &#145;grave and serious discourse&#146;, which he ushered in with the words &#145;Now let us call for a reckoning&#146;  (Calamy, 15).<br>
<br>The prospectus for the <span class="italic">Synopsis</span> bore the names of eight bishops and five continental scholars, besides other divines. Simon Patrick, Tillotson, and Stillingfleet, with four laymen, acted as trustees of the funds raised by subscription for the project. A royal patent for the work was granted on 14 October 1667. The first volume had been prepared for the press when a London bookseller, Cornelius Bee, challenged the legitimacy of the project. Bee had been the publisher of the nine-volume <span class="italic">Critici sacri</span> in 1660, a compilation of Renaissance biblical exegesis. He accused Poole of invading his own patent, by utilizing works reprinted in the <span class="italic">Critici sacri</span>, and damaging prospective sales of a mooted second edition. Poole had offered Bee a fourth share in the property of the <span class="italic">Synopsis</span>, an offer Bee declined. Both disputants printed a series of acrimonious pamphlets in defence of their case before the matter was referred to Henry Pierrepont, marquess of Dorchester, and Arthur Annesley, first earl of Anglesey. They decided in Poole's favour, granting Bee the fourth share originally offered by Poole. Four thousand copies were printed, and sold relatively quickly. The work constituted an important compendium of biblical commentary and exegesis, condensing into brief notes a great deal of study. As well as abridging texts from the <span class="italic">Critici sacri</span>, Poole also included extracts from a large number of minor treatises. He used rabbinical sources and Roman Catholic texts extensively, but as with the <span class="italic">Critici sacri</span> little was taken from Calvin and nothing from Luther. In April 1693 the work was placed on the Roman index. The <span class="italic">Synopsis</span> was originally produced in Latin for a scholarly audience; afterwards Poole began a smaller series of annotations in English for a broader, less educated readership. He reached <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> 58 by the time of his death, and other scholars completed the project, published in two volumes as <span class="italic">Annotations upon the Holy Bible</span> (1683&#150;5). The work was frequently reprinted, into the twentieth century.<br>
<br>During his depositions regarding the Popish Plot in September 1678, Titus Oates represented Poole as being singled out for assassination on account of his publications against the Roman Catholic religion. In a work published the following year, entitled <span class="italic">A True Narrative of the Horrid Plot and Conspiracy of the Popish Party</span>, Oates maintained that &#145;the Society in London would procure Dr Stillingfleet to be knockt [<i>sic</i>] on the head, and also Poole, the Author of <span class="roman">Synopsis Criticorum</span>, for writing some things against them&#146;  (p. 19). Poole apparently gave the report no credit, until an incident occurred late one night when he believed two men designed to kill him but desisted when they saw he had a companion.<br>
<br>Poole left England in 1678, and settled in Amsterdam. He died there on 12 October 1679. An unsubstantiated suspicion was expressed that he had been poisoned. He was buried in a vault under the church belonging to the English merchants trading in Amsterdam. He left a son, who died in 1697. His portrait was engraved by R. White, and was printed in the first volume of <span class="italic">Annotations upon the Holy Bible</span>.<br>
