<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gould,  Sabine  Baring-</span>  (1834&#150;1924), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman, author, and folksong collector</span>, born at Dix's Field, Exeter, on 28 January 1834, was the eldest of the three sons and a daughter of Edward Baring-Gould, a captain in the armed forces of the East India Company, invalided out in 1830 as the result of an accident in India when still a young man. He returned home to the uneventful life of squire of Lew Trenchard, Devon, and in 1832 married his first wife, Sophia Charlotte, daughter of Admiral Francis Godolphin Bond RN. Cold, stern, and with a low threshold of boredom, Captain Baring-Gould in 1837 took his wife, young son, and servants to the continent until 1844, when they returned home to begin Sabine Baring-Gould's English education. He boarded at King's College, London, from 1844 to 1846, and in 1847 he attended Warwick grammar school.<br>
<br>Sabine's delicate health persuaded his willing father to resume the family sojourns in Europe, visiting France, Belgium, Italy, Germany, and Austria. The sons, Sabine and William, were educated by tutors and travel. Sabine Baring-Gould had a photographic memory, read voraciously, and picked up languages with ease. At sixteen he organized the excavation of a buried Roman pavement at Pau, and at seventeen he determined his three tasks in life: to help in the spiritual rousing of the people, to restore the family home of Lew House, and to restore Lew Trenchard church. In 1852 the Baring-Goulds temporarily moved to Tavistock, near Dartmoor, and in 1853 Baring-Gould entered Clare College, Cambridge, as a student of the classics, in which he was poorly versed. Tall, handsome, and romantically religious, he was attracted by the Tractarian movement, and hoped to become a priest, but in 1856, after graduating BA with a pass degree, he encountered parental opposition. As elder son he had to become squire, thus leaving the family living for his brother.<br>
<br>Disappointed, Baring-Gould turned to teaching, starting at the choir school of St Barnabas, Pimlico, where he met the Revd C. F. Lowder, a well-known Tractarian. He moved to Lancing, a Woodard school, and then to its associate school, Hurstpierpoint College. But in 1863 his parents changed their minds about his ordination, for William refused to go into the church; in 1864 Baring-Gould was made deacon at Ripon, and became curate to the Revd John Sharp, rector of Horbury, Yorkshire. In 1865 Baring-Gould was ordained priest and dispatched to the rough district of Horbury Brig to organize a church mission.<br>
<br>Baring-Gould relished the task, worked day and night, set up an evening school, and won all hearts by his story-telling. Four of his hymns, &#145;On the Resurrection Morning&#146;, written in December 1863 on his mother's death; &#145;Onward, Christian soldiers&#146;, written at Hurstpierpoint College in 1864; and &#145;Through the night of doubt and sorrow&#146;, translated from the Danish, and &#145;Now the day is over&#146;, both written at Horbury Brig, became favourites at the mission.<br>
<br>In 1866 Baring-Gould met his future wife, Grace Taylor, at Horbury Brig. She was a beautiful factory girl of sixteen, who had been working since she was ten years old. Both sets of parents (in 1865 Captain Baring-Gould had married Lavinia Snow, a younger family friend who, with her mother, had accompanied the Baring-Goulds to the continent in 1847) opposed the marriage, but Baring-Gould persisted. Grace Taylor lived for two years in York with a female relative of John Sharp, acquiring an education. On 24 May 1868 the couple were married by Sharp at Horbury Brig, no relatives of bride or groom being present. Five sons and ten daughters were born, one daughter dying in infancy. Grace Baring-Gould was self-possessed and much loved. She died on 8 April 1916, and the words &#145;Dimidium animae meae&#146; (Half my soul) were inscribed over her tombstone. Baring-Gould's first novel, <span class="italic">Through Flood and Flame</span> (1868), is held to be partly autobiographical.<br>
<br>In 1867 Baring-Gould became perpetual curate at Dalton, Yorkshire, where he wrote steadily, following his <span class="italic">Book of Were-Wolves</span> (1865) and <span class="italic">Curious Myths of the Middle Ages</span> (1866, 1868). His <span class="italic">Origin and Development of Religious Belief</span> (1869, 1870), suggested by Darwin's theories, was condemned by Roman Catholics, Anglicans, and extreme protestants, but W. E. Gladstone liked the book, and in 1871, when prime minister, he offered Baring-Gould the crown living of East Mersea, Essex. There Baring-Gould wrote <span class="italic">The Vicar of Morwenstowe: a Life of Robert Stephen Hawker</span> (1876), criticized for glaring inaccuracies but loved for its true flavour of Hawker and the west country. He began the <span class="italic">Lives of the Saints</span>, published in fifteen volumes; it comprised 3600 biographies arranged in order of the saints' days, Baring-Gould working at them from 1872 to 1877. The Roman Catholic church put them on the Index. The <span class="italic">Lives</span> was reprinted in 1897&#150;8 and again in 1914. Three volumes&#151;the British, the English, and the Northumbrian saints&#151;were reprinted in 1990. He also wrote a powerful novel, <span class="italic">Mehalah</span> (1880), likened by the poet Swinburne to <span class="italic">Wuthering Heights</span>.<br>
<br>When his father died in 1872, Baring-Gould inherited the Devon estate, but his elderly uncle remained the incumbent at Lew Trenchard. In addition, Baring-Gould had to support his brother, William, his stepmother, his young half-brother, Arthur, and his half-sister, Lilah. He therefore let Lew House, remained at East Mersea, and frequently took his family abroad, partly for health reasons and partly for research. In his absence the parish was looked after by the Revd J. M. Gatrill. His uncle died in 1881, whereupon Baring-Gould presented himself to the family living and moved into Lew House.<br>
<br>Baring-Gould was a popular parson whose forceful sermons attracted people from outside the parish. He revived harvest festivals and encouraged activities for children. His books paid for new cottages, repairs to farms, and the restoration of the manor house and the church. He wrote over forty novels; over sixty theological volumes of sermons, hymns, and devotional books; twenty-four guide and travel books; a score of general interest books; and collections of folksongs. His books were constantly reprinted, many remaining in print at the end of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Baring-Gould's folksong collecting began in earnest in 1888, with help from the Revd H. Fleetwood Sheppard and Dr F. W. Bussell. He recorded the tunes accurately but did not hesitate to write fresh words if he considered the existing ones to be indecent. Thus &#145;Kit has Lost her Key [Cow]&#146; became &#145;Strawberry Fair&#146;. The words of &#145;Widecombe Fair&#146; are believed to be authentic. He encouraged his daughter Joan to teach folk dancing in the village. From 1904 he was a friend and collaborator of Cecil Sharp, the folksong and dance collector. Baring-Gould believed his most important work to have been the folksong collecting. He hoped it would &#145;resuscitate the traditional music of the English&#146;, and to that end he deposited copies of the songs and tunes he collected in the Free Municipal Library in Plymouth, thus making them available to all.<br>
<br>Baring-Gould and Robert Burnard examined Dartmoor's past, and were founder members of the Dartmoor Exploration Committee in 1894. Baring-Gould also belonged to the Devonshire Association and was president in 1895. He was a member of the Royal Institution of Cornwall, and president for ten years from 1897. He won the Henwood gold medal for his presidential addresses on the &#145;Early history of Cornwall&#146; and on &#145;The Celtic saints&#146;. In 1918 Clare College made him an honorary fellow.<br>
<br>Baring-Gould spent his last years writing his <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span> and two religious books, <span class="italic">The Church Revival</span> (1918), and <span class="italic">The Evangelical Revival</span> (1920). He died at Lew House on 2 January 1924, and was buried in Lew Trenchard churchyard next to his wife. Above his tombstone was inscribed &#145;Paravi lucernam Christo meo&#146; (I have prepared a lantern for my Christ).<br>
