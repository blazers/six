<span class="headword">Sewell,  William</span>  (1804&#150;1874), <span class="occ">clergyman and author</span>, was born on 23 January 1804 and baptized on 13 January 1807 at Newport, Isle of Wight. He was the second son of Thomas Sewell (1775&#150;1842), a prominent solicitor of Newport, variously recorder of the borough, twice its mayor, steward and deputy governor of the island, and of his wife and also first cousin, Jane (1773/4&#150;1848), youngest daughter of the Revd John Edwards, curate of Newport. William Sewell had five brothers and six sisters, among them his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25145/', "Richard Clarke Sewell (bap. 1803, d. 1864)")</script>, a legal writer, and his younger siblings <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25142/', "Henry Sewell (1807&#150;1879)")</script>, first premier of New Zealand, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36028/', "Revd Dr James Edwards Sewell (1810&#150;1903)")</script>, warden of New College, Oxford, from 1860 until 1903, and the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36027/', "Elizabeth Missing Sewell (1815&#150;1906)")</script>. William Sewell attended Winchester College as a commoner from 1819 to 1822, and on 4 November 1822 matriculated at Merton College, Oxford, where he held a postmastership until 1827. He took first-class honours in <i>literae humaniores</i>, graduating BA on 2 June 1827, MA on 2 July 1829, and subsequently BD on 17 June 1841, and DD on 20 May 1857.<br>
<br>On 30 June 1827 Sewell was elected Petrean fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, winning the chancellor's prize for the English essay in 1828 and for the Latin essay in 1829. Ordained deacon by the bishop of Bristol in 1831 and priest by the bishop of Winchester in 1832, he served as curate at Whippingham, 3 miles from his home on the Isle of Wight, before his appointment on 10 July 1831 as perpetual curate of St Nicholas in Carisbrooke Castle, a moderate sinecure which he retained until his death. He returned to Oxford in 1831 as tutor at Exeter College, where he remained until 1853, serving as librarian from 1833, sub-rector and divinity reader from 1835, and dean from 1839. In 1832&#150;3 he was an examiner in the classical schools, and from 1836 to 1841 Whyte's professor of moral philosophy, his exposition of Platonism doing much to break down the dominance of the Aristotelian tradition in the Oxford school. His professorial lectures were revised and published as <span class="italic">Christian Morals</span> and <span class="italic">Christian Politics</span>, both of which appeared in <span class="roman">The Englishman's Library</span> series in 1840, while <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Dialogues of Plato</span>, based on articles in the <span class="italic">British Critic</span> and the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, appeared in 1841. Sewell also established a moral philosophy club which met in its members' college rooms.<br>
<br>Sewell's steadfast high-churchmanship brought him into natural sympathy with the emerging Oxford Movement. The subscription controversy of 1834 provoked his earliest polemical writing, in pamphlets such as <span class="italic">The Attack upon the University of Oxford, in a Letter to Earl Grey</span> (1834), <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Admission of Dissenters to the University of Oxford</span> (1834), and his <span class="italic">Postscript to Thoughts on Subscription</span> (1835), while a prominent article of 1839 in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> on &#145;Oxford theology&#146; warmly commended the writers of the <span class="roman">Tracts for the Times</span>. Sewell always steered an independent line, however, due partly to his idiosyncratic character, partly to his &#145;fearing the creation of a party&#146;  (W. Sewell, <span class="italic">A Letter to the Rev. E. B. Pusey, D.D.</span>, 1841, 10), but principally to his vehement anti-Catholicism. He therefore abhorred Newman's <span class="roman">Tract 90</span> of 1841, explaining his position in a succession of pronouncements such as the published letter to Pusey, a notable article in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (March 1842), &#145;The divines of the seventeenth century&#146;, and sermons such as <span class="italic">The Duty of Young Men in Times of Controversy</span> (1843), intended to counter tractarianism's Romeward direction. Sewell's anxiety at this trend was memorialized in the well-known pun on his name, Suillus (the Latin diminutive for <i>sus</i>, a pig), &#145;because he would not go the whole hog&#146;  (Stride, <span class="italic">Exeter College</span>, 159), attributed variously to Sydney Smith, Sewell's Exeter contemporary J. B. Morris, and (Sewell's own suspect) Richard Whately.<br>
<br>&#145;Sewell of Exeter&#146; gained the highest reputation as a tutor in these years  (A. Quiller-Couch, <span class="italic">Reminiscences of Oxford by Oxford Men</span>, 351), and if his lectures were considered too discursive and eclectic for the purist, his intellectual range, trenchant opinions, and sheer unpredictability, made them magnetic to a broader undergraduate audience. It was therefore widely reported, and even interpreted as an expression of the university's official censure, when on 27 February 1849 Sewell, finding that an undergraduate had brought a copy of J. A. Froude's <span class="italic">The Nemesis of Faith</span> into a lecture, flung the book into the fire in Exeter hall. Despite his fixity of views Sewell was almost single-handedly responsible for improving the college's then unintellectual tone. His devoted pedagogy was the personification of his wider arguments for university reform, expressed in such satirical material as his anonymous <span class="italic">The University Commission, or, Lord John Russell's Postbag</span>, which appeared in four instalments in 1850, and published sermons such as his <span class="italic">Collegiate Reform</span> of 1853. Sewell took the typically singular position that Oxford's colleges should reform themselves by throwing open their closed scholarships and fellowships, but that the government had no right to intervene if they did not, the <span class="roman">University Reform Act</span> (1854) therefore representing a defeat for his vision. He was, moreover, one of the earliest advocates of what came to be known as university extension; his public paper to the vice-chancellor, <span class="italic">Suggestions for the Extension of the University</span> (1850) urged a federation of local professoriates giving instruction under the direct authority of Oxford and Cambridge, though the proposal foundered on its cost and university extension was ultimately felt rather through the system of local examinations.<br>
<br>The most important expression of Sewell's educational vision, however, was his conviction of the need to establish schools which could serve as nurseries of sound religion, a project begun in Ireland, where the church seemed most obviously in danger. Lord Adare, an Irish landowner and MP, and an active high-church layman, visited Sewell in Oxford in the spring of 1839, and after Sewell had twice visited Ireland in 1840 he collaborated with Adare's friend, near neighbour, and brother-in-law, the MP for co. Limerick William Monsell, and James Henthorn Todd, Adare's former tutor at Trinity College, Dublin, in order to found St Columba's College, which was opened on 25 April 1843 at Stackallan, co. Meath, before settling at Rathfarnham, near Dublin, in 1849. The college was intended to promote high-church principles and to aid the conversion of Irish Catholics through the use of the Irish language, and to furnish the gentry of Ireland with a school on the model of Winchester or Eton, though its Anglican proselytism and teaching of Irish did not survive the 1840s. Sewell initially contemplated serving as warden of St Columba's, but was deterred by worries over family responsibilities arising from his father's illness and then death in 1842, and his immersion in university politics. In December 1845 Sewell, Adare, and Monsell resigned as governors, and a new constitution was put in place; Sewell severed all ties with the college in support of its first warden, the Revd R. C. Singleton, who resigned in June 1846 in protest at the relaxation of rules requiring observance of the fasts of the church.<br>
<br>The principle on which Sewell apparently quit St Columba's, his albeit ephemeral association with tractarianism, and the later secession of Adare and Monsell to Rome, aroused some suspicion of his activities, though undaunted he immediately embarked on an analogous initiative on returning to England. He published his account of the experience, <span class="italic">Journal of a Residence at the College of St Columba, in Ireland</span>, in the spring of 1847, in order to prepare the way for St Peter's College (now Radley College) at Radley, just outside Oxford, which opened on 18 August 1847. Its motto, &#145;Sicut serpentes, Sicut columbae&#146;, underlined the continuities of approach, Sewell's churchmanship reflected in the school's observation of the fasts of the church and of full morning and evening service in the chapel. Singleton followed Sewell to Radley and served as its first warden, though he came to resent Sewell's constant interference in its affairs and resigned in 1851. Amid falling pupil numbers and deepening debt, Sewell himself served as warden between 1853 and 1861, assisted by his brother Robert. Sewell's hopeless disregard for financial matters only exacerbated Radley's plight, and its debts of &pound;40,000 were paid off only when, after his desperate <span class="italic">Appeal for the Permanent Security and Foundation of St Peter's College, Radley</span> (1861), the merchant John Gellibrand Hubbard, later Lord Addington, MP for the City of London, lent that sum to the college and improved management was put in place, Sewell leaving the school. Although Arnold of Rugby was the pioneer of the reform of public schools, Sewell was the first to give this development a high-church direction, and was unusual in his insistence on the collegiate rather than authoritarian model.<br>
<br>Sewell served as preacher at Whitehall in 1850, and select preacher at Oxford in 1852. In addition to numerous published single sermons he issued a number of collections, such as <span class="italic">Sermons on the Application of Christianity to the Human Heart</span> (1831), <span class="italic">Parochial Sermons on Particular Occasions</span> (1832), <span class="italic">Sermons Addressed to Young Men</span> (1835), and <span class="italic">The Character of Pilate and the Spirit of the Age</span> (1850). A miscellany of Sewell's school sermons appeared as <span class="italic">A Year's Sermons to Boys, Preached in the Chapel of St Peter's College, Radley</span> (1854), with a second volume of <span class="italic">Sermons to Boys</span> appearing in 1859, and a collection of <span class="italic">Sermons Preached in the Chapel of St Peter's College, Radley</span> in 1864. If these collections are repetitive and unremarkable, Sewell's classical scholarship, which included <span class="italic">Hora philologica, or Conjectures on the Structure of the Greek Language</span> (1830), and translations of <span class="italic">The Georgics</span> (1846), <span class="italic">The Agamemnon</span> (1846), and <span class="italic">The Odes and Epodes of Horace</span> (1850), was mostly derided by contemporaries.<br>
<br>Sewell came to far wider public notice, albeit anonymously, as a prolific reviewer for the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, contributing fifteen articles between February 1837 and September 1845 before his diversions in Ireland. Sewell's range and vigour were especially suited to periodical writing, though his articles were pungent rather than original: the <span class="italic">Review</span>'s editor J. G. Lockhart remarked of his pieces that &#145;They tell one nothing, they mean nothing, they are nothing, but they go down like bottled velvet&#146;  (James, 53). Equally noteworthy was Sewell's activity in the rapidly expanding field of religious fiction. His anonymous <span class="italic">Hawkstone: a Tale of and for England in 184&#151;</span> (2 vols., 1845), which ran through numerous editions, is chiefly remembered for the wildly sensationalist tone of its emphasis on the church's lost social functions, its hostility to manufacturing and the commercial spirit, and its hysterical anti-Jesuitism. Sewell also anonymously issued <span class="italic">Uncle Peter's Fairy Tales</span> (1844), <span class="italic">Uncle Peter's Tale for the Nineteenth Century</span> (1868), and <span class="italic">The Giant: a Fairy Tale</span> (1870). Having introduced his sister Elizabeth to Keble and Newman among others, Sewell encouraged her to start writing in order both to promulgate church principles and to alleviate the heavy family debts left by their father. Her <span class="italic">Amy Herbert</span> (2 vols., 1844) and <span class="italic">Gertrude</span> (2 vols., 1846) duly embodied high-church views, while <span class="italic">Laneton Parsonage: a Tale for Children</span> (3 vols., 1846&#150;9) was intended to encourage the use of the catechism, and was followed by the anti-secessionist <span class="italic">Margaret Percival</span> (2 vols., 1847), her voluminous early novels appearing without attribution but as &#145;edited by&#146; her brother. Sewell himself also issued a volume of poetry, <span class="italic">A Clergyman's Recreation, or, Sacred Thoughts, in Verse</span> (1831), written mostly during his curacy at Whippingham and inspired by Keble's <span class="italic">Christian Year</span>.<br>
<br>Sewell's health, as well as his finances, had been broken by his years as warden of Radley, and after his resignation in 1861, with his fellowship at Exeter sequestrated, he moved about for several years, principally between Bonchurch on the Isle of Wight, where three of his sisters had opened a school, and London. He later travelled throughout Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg, before in 1866 taking up residence at Deutz, on the Rhine opposite Cologne, where he worked on new translations of the <span class="italic">Iliad</span> and the <span class="italic">Odyssey</span>, and a new metrical version of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>, which were left unpublished at his death, though <span class="italic">The Microscope of the New Testament</span>, the principal fruit of these years, appeared posthumously in 1878 edited by Sewell's friend the Revd W. J. Crichton. In 1870 Sewell was driven home by the Franco-Prussian War, and spent his last four years chiefly on the Isle of Wight. He died peacefully at the residence of his nephew the Revd Arthur Sewell, at Litchford Hall, near Manchester, on 14 November 1874, and was buried in St Andrew's churchyard, Blackley, Manchester. There is a window inscribed to his memory in the chapel at Exeter College, Oxford.<br>
<br>The very diversity of his interests has left posterity with little sense of Sewell's considerable contemporary reputation. At his death contemporaries agreed that he had dissipated his intellectual energies over too wide a range of subjects. Thomas Mozley reflected that &#145;Had he thought a little more he might have written to more purpose; and had he tried for less he might have obtained more&#146;  (T. Mozley, <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 1882, 2.23&#150;4). Garrulous and opinionated, he was perhaps easier company as an author or lecturer than in person.<br>
