<span class="headword">Briscoe,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1697), <span class="occ">merchant and projector</span>, is described in many records as a merchant, although little is known of his trading activities. He was apprenticed to a member of the London Salters' Company, although his name does not appear in that company's serving registers. He may have been the John Briscoe of St Antholin, London, citizen and salter, who, aged about twenty-six, married Elizabeth Carre of St Botolph, Aldgate, on 19 December 1676.<br>
<br>On 15 April 1685 Briscoe petitioned &#145;for letters patent for the sole use and benefit of a new invention for making sizing and whitening all sorts of writing, printing and other paper&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1685</i>, 130). The following year he, with others, petitioned for a charter as<blockquote>at vast expense of money and time they have brought to perfection the finest sorts of writing and printing paper by the making whereof not only will thousands be employed and brought up to industry and art, but vast sums of money will be kept in the country which are now daily sent abroad to pay for imported paper. (ibid., <i>1686&#150;7</i>, 167)</blockquote>They were incorporated as the Governor and Company of White Paper Makers, and in the mid-eighteenth century it was acknowledged that &#145;Mr Brisco &amp; Co. &hellip; improved the paper made greatly&#146;  (Coleman, 76).<br>
<br>Briscoe was involved in the establishment of a number of other companies. In 1691 he became the deputy governor of a &#145;new corporation for the setting the poor at Work, by a joint stock throughout England&#146; called the Royal Corporation in England  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1690&#150;91</i>, 422). Also in this year he became an assistant in the Company of Copper Miners in England for the melting down, refining, and purifying of copper ore, was involved in the incorporation of a company to establish a linen manufacture in Scotland, and became the deputy governor of the Company of Merchant Adventurers trading to the north-west part of America.<br>
<br>In 1694 Briscoe published <span class="italic">A Discourse on the Late Funds</span>, in which he criticized existing funds and set forth the details of his proposed land bank to be founded upon the subscriptions of land by copyholders and freeholders. He proposed the issuing of bills of credit &#145;being a new Species of Money, and to all Intents and Purposes as useful as Money&#146;  (Briscoe, <span class="italic">A Discourse on the Late Funds of the Million Act, Lottery Act, and Bank of England</span>, 1694, 30). Despite having his plans rejected by a Commons committee in 1695 Briscoe opened the books for subscription to the National Land Bank on 11 June 1695. With the initial target of &pound;100,000 in land subscriptions met, a meeting was held on 10 September to establish a committee for the bank. Many failed to pay their initial instalments, and consequently the bank did very little business in the early months. At this time Briscoe's proposals to lend the government much needed money to finance the war led to a collaboration with the founders of the Land Bank at Exeter Exchange, John Asgill and Nicholas Barbon. Despite opposition, particularly from the Bank of England, the two banks were incorporated by act of parliament as the Governor and Company of the National Land Bank of England to lend the government over &pound;2.5 million at 7 per cent interest. Subscription books were opened at the end of May 1696 but very little was subscribed, and on 11 June one contemporary observed that the &#145;land bank makes but little progress&#146;  (Luttrell, 4.71). The failure of this scheme has been attributed not only to the shortage of coin in this year, and the financial climate more generally, but also to &#145;public opinion&#146; which appeared &#145;to have been against the venture&#146;  (Horsefield, 207). Both banks, however, continued separately, with Briscoe's holding meetings until at least July 1696. John Briscoe died on 13 February 1697 and in his will, proved in the prerogative court of Canterbury on 24 March, he left property in the county of Hertford to his son, John, and his London property to his daughter, Elizabeth.<br>
