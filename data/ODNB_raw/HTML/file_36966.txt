<span class="headword">Wilson,  (John) Leonard</span>  (1897&#150;1970), <span class="occ">bishop of Birmingham</span>, was born at Gateshead Fell, co. Durham, on 23 November 1897, the second child in the family of one daughter and four sons of John Wilson, curate of Gateshead Fell, and his wife, Mary Adelaide, daughter of Thomas Halliday, secretary to the firm of Armstrong Whitworth. He was educated at Newcastle grammar school and St John's School, Leatherhead. In 1916 he enlisted in the Durham light infantry, and saw service in France.<br>
<br>In 1919 Wilson joined the Knutsford Training School, an experiment to equip clergy for the post-war world, and subsequently took a shortened course in theology at the Queen's College, Oxford, where he was influenced by the social and ecumenical thinking of the Student Christian Movement and the theological liberalism of B. H. Streeter. He graduated BA in 1922. After a brief appointment in 1922&#150;3 to the staff of the Stuart Memorial College, Esfahan, he completed his training in 1923&#150;4 at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, and was ordained in 1924 to serve the cathedral parish of St Michael, Coventry. In 1927 he joined the Church Missionary Society, in the expectation that he would become principal of the Old Cairo Boys' School, but his secular manner of life and his Christological opinions offended the society, and he returned from Egypt in 1929 as curate of St Margaret's, Durham, with charge of St John's, Neville Cross. In 1930 he married Doris Ruby (Mary) Phillips, the daughter of a merchant trading in Egypt; they had four sons, one of whom died in childhood, and one daughter. As vicar of Eighton Banks (1930&#150;35) and of Roker (1935&#150;8) he threw himself into the congenial task of presenting a social gospel in a time of severe deprivation in the north of England.<br>
<br>In 1938 Wilson became archdeacon of Hong Kong, and in 1941 was consecrated bishop of Singapore. He had no time to make an impression on the diocese in normal conditions, since the Japanese conquest involved his internment in the notorious Changi gaol in 1943. He was repeatedly tortured, on suspicion that the gaol was a centre of espionage, but his endurance, and the courage his ministry inspired in others, convinced him of the reality of the Christian faith, and raised him to an international figure. His tenure of the deanery of Manchester, to which he was appointed in 1949, was unhappy. He saw opportunities for unconventional experiment, while the cathedral authorities wished to re-establish cherished traditions, and it was with general relief that he was nominated bishop of Birmingham in 1953.<br>
<br>Wilson's succession to the controversial Ernest William Barnes was intended to be eirenic, and to concentrate episcopal attention on diocesan and civic, rather than national and theological, issues. He avoided dispute, made few statements on secular affairs, and discouraged his clergy from political action. He faced a diocese seriously understaffed, in which urban replanning, the building of vast housing estates, and the settlement of overspill communities meant the redistribution of churches and the provision of new centres of worship and social life. An appeal launched in 1956 eventually met most needs, and Wilson's liberal and evangelical reputation began to attract more clergy. His cast of mind, and his missionary experience, made him, in his own words, &#145;almost a fanatic about church unity&#146;, and he powerfully supported the Birmingham Council of Churches, founded in 1951, and its local agencies. His episcopate saw a great influx of black and Asian immigrants into the midlands, and his example, with the establishment of a special chaplaincy, assured the initial amicable reception which was perhaps the greatest post-war social achievement of the Birmingham churches. He resigned his see in 1969.<br>
<br>Wilson was appointed CMG in 1946 and KCMG in 1968; from 1963 he was prelate of the order. He was awarded a Lambeth DD in 1953, and an honorary DSc of the University of Aston in Birmingham in 1969; he was elected an honorary fellow of the Queen's College, Oxford, in 1954. He had an imposing presence and a fine voice. Conscious of his lack of scholarship, he distrusted intellectuals; he was autocratic and impatient of committees; his temper was quick and uncertain; but in personal and pastoral relationships he was generous and gracious. His episcopate in Birmingham cemented a divided diocese, and strengthened the influence of the church on civic and social life: his understanding of his experience in Singapore stimulated faith in a sceptical and disillusioned age. In 1959 he published <span class="italic">Marriage, Sex, and the Family</span>.<br>
<br>Wilson died in retirement at Bainbridge, near Leyburn, Yorkshire, on 18 August 1970. His memorial in Birmingham Cathedral described him as &#145;Confessor for the Faith&#146;, in the sense used in the ages of persecution.<br>
