<span class="headword">Tregury,  Michael</span>  (<em>c.</em>1399&#150;1471), <span class="occ">archbishop of Dublin</span>, was born at St Wenn in Cornwall and was educated at Oxford (BA by 1426, BTh by 1439, and DTh by 1444). From 1422 to 1427 he was fellow of Exeter College and in 1434&#150;5 he was senior proctor of the university. Henry VI appointed Tregury first rector of the University of Caen in October 1439, a position he had resigned by March 1440.<br>
<br>John Bale attributed to Tregury the authorship of three works, apparently lectures delivered at Caen: <span class="italic">Lectura sententiarum</span>, <span class="italic">De origine illius studii</span> (perhaps referring to the University of Caen), and <span class="italic">Ordinariae quaestiones</span>. None of them is known to have been printed or to be extant. Tregury was said to have been principal of various halls connected with Exeter College in the 1420s and 1430s. He was ordained priest in March 1427 and held a number of different benefices, particularly in the diocese of Exeter, between 1429 and his promotion to the archbishopric of Dublin in 1449; these included canonries of Crediton, Devon (1447&#150;9); of St Martin le Grand, London (1447&#150;9); of Exeter (resigned 1449); and also the archdeaconry of Barnstaple (1445&#150;9). He was appointed chaplain to Henry VI and Queen Margaret of Anjou. About 1447 the latter wrote recommending Tregury's appointment to the vicarage of Corfe Castle or the bishopric of Lisieux. Neither suggestion seems to have been adopted.<br>
<br>On the death of Richard Talbot, archbishop of Dublin, in 1449, Tregury was papally provided to that see; he was suspended by the pope in 1453 for being consecrated before receiving the bull of provision and without taking an oath of fealty. As archbishop he was a member of the Irish privy council, in which capacity he received an annual salary of &pound;20 but he did not hold other governmental positions. He was in Ireland by late 1451 having been shipwrecked <i>en route</i>. He had royal licence to be absent from Ireland for three years from 1458 and again for one year in 1461. His tenure of the archbishopric, which lasted twenty-two years, was marked by an active policy of ecclesiastical visitations and disputes with the archbishop of Armagh over the claims to primacy. His predecessor, Talbot, had apparently much depleted the revenues of his see and, finding the metropolitan cross in pawn and much of the archiepiscopal demesne alienated, Tregury obtained a papal indult to hold other benefices to a total value of not more than &pound;200. In 1462 he was violently assaulted and imprisoned in Dublin by some Irishmen, who were excommunicated for the offence. His claims to lands and jurisdiction were resented by Anglo-Irish and Gaelic Irish. In 1465 he was indicted for assault; he subsequently cleared himself, claiming that there was a conspiracy against him.<br>
<br>Tregury died at his manor house of Tallaght, near Dublin, on 21 December 1471 and was buried near St Stephen's altar in St Patrick's Cathedral. The monument erected over his tomb was afterwards buried under the rubbish in St Stephen's Chapel, where it was discovered by Dean Swift in 1730 and re-erected on the wall to the left of the west gate. By his will, which is dated 10 December 1471, Tregury bequeathed to St Patrick's Cathedral his &#145;pair of organs&#146; and two silver salt-cellars to be made into chalices; he also directed that oblations should be made on his behalf to St Michael's Mount, Cornwall.<br>
