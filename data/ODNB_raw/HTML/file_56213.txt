<span class="headword">Ward,  Ann</span>  (1715/16&#150;1789), <span class="occ">printer</span>, married a York printer, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64292/', "Caesar Ward (bap. 1710, d. 1759)")</script>, about 1738, but little else is known about her early life. She is best known for her role in the publication of the first edition of Laurence Sterne's <span class="italic">Tristram Shandy</span> (1760).<br>
<br>Women had always been active in the York newspaper trade. Its first newspaper, the <span class="italic">York Mercury</span>, was printed and published by Grace White and John Hammond from 1719 to 1721; later it was printed by Alice Bourne. The <span class="italic">York Courant</span>, established by John White in 1725, was for a time printed by another woman&#151;Sarah Coke. It changed ownership several times before 1739, when it was bought by Caesar Ward and his brother-in-law Richard Chandler. Chandler's over-ambitious publishing ventures led to his suicide and Ward's bankruptcy in 1744, but Ward recovered his interest in the <span class="italic">Courant</span>, and the proprietorship passed to Ann Ward when her husband died in 1759.<br>
<br>Kenneth Monkman has shown beyond any bibliographical doubt that Ann Ward was the printer of the first two volumes of <span class="italic">Tristram Shandy</span>. It is true that Sterne turned first to the literary publisher Robert Dodsley to oversee the printing and publishing of his book in London, but when Dodsley questioned the author's conditions, Sterne took his manuscript to a York printer whose work he already knew: Caesar Ward had printed several of Sterne's sermons, and his widow, Ann Ward, had recently taken over the Coney Street business. &#145;The Book shall be printed here&#146;, Sterne wrote to Dodsley in October 1759,<blockquote>&amp; the Impression sent up to You; for as I live at York &amp; shall correct every Proof myself, it shall go perfect into the World&#151;&amp; be printed in so creditable a way as to Paper Type etc&#151;as to do no Dishonour to You, who I know never chuse to print a Book meanly. (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 421)</blockquote>This first instalment of <span class="italic">Tristram Shandy</span> convinced readers and the trade alike: the book sold well, Dodsley bought up the copyright (at a far higher price than Sterne had originally asked), and Ann Ward attracted more business.<br>
<br>Like most provincial printers, Ann Ward printed primarily local material: sermons preached at York, trials, official publications, poll books, guidebooks, and regional history, including editions of Francis Drake's <span class="italic">Eboracum</span>. Other favourite authors were John Evelyn and William Mason. Horace Walpole called Mason's York-printed translation of Dufresnoy's <span class="italic">De arte graphica</span> &#145;a very handsome book&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 403). The <span class="italic">Eighteenth-Century Short-Title Catalogue</span> records almost a hundred different titles printed by Ann Ward, many of them in association with the Dodsleys or other important London booksellers.<br>
<br>For much of her career, Ann Ward was assisted by the printer David Russell, formerly employed by her husband. Russell became part-owner of the business, although his name did not appear in their imprints. About 1787 Ann Ward bought back Russell's share, so that the whole of her printing business could be passed on to her son-in-law George Peacock.<br>
<br>Ann and Caesar Ward had at least eight children, among them Caesar Ward (baptized 4 December 1741), who became free of the Stationers' Company in 1763 and set up a printing house in London, and Mary (baptized 27 June 1740), who married George Peacock, her mother's successor in business. Ann Ward was said to be seventy-three years old when she died on 10 April 1789.<br>
