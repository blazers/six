<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Crooks,  William <span class="st"> [Will]</span></span>  (1852&#150;1921), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 6 April 1852 at 2 Shirbutt Street, a one-roomed house near the docks at Poplar in the East End of London. He was the third of seven children of Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Coates (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1821), and George Crooks (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1821). The family experienced extreme poverty after George, a ship's stoker, lost his right arm in an accident and was reduced to occasional casual work. At one time they were forced into Poplar workhouse. Will Crooks recalled that his mother took in additional sewing to maintain the family, but could not afford the fare to deliver it. The bitter experience of poor-law schooling and separation from his parents never left him. Crooks was baptized a Congregationalist and briefly attended George Green elementary school, Crisp Street. From the age of seven he worked at labouring jobs until his mother insisted on his apprenticeship to a cooper. In 1871 Crooks married Matilda South (1854&#150;1892), a shipwright's daughter. They endured difficult times; of their ten children only six survived. He tramped twice to Liverpool to find work as employers in Poplar victimized him as a political agitator.<br>
<br>By the 1890s, with his broad-shouldered figure, long sinewy arms, and full-bearded face, Crooks was a familiar and beloved personality in his locality. He spoke every Sunday morning outside the East India Dock gates. These well-attended democratic gatherings, known as &#145;Crooks College&#146;, inaugurated various campaigns for a free library, tunnels under the Thames, and poor-law reform. He was an unsung hero during the London Dock strike, while continuing to work his own trade, but the strain of his dual endeavours led to illness, and he afterwards spent three months in the London Hospital close to death.<br>
<br>In 1892 Matilda died, aged thirty-eight. The following year Crooks married a widow, Elisabeth Coulter, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lake (1854&#150;1932), and their home (28 Northumberland Street and later 81 Gough Street) became a haven of local politics. His remarkable appeal as a people's politician was exemplified by his matchless skill in public speaking: his power to sway audiences combined the inspiration of the evangelist and the everyday humour of the cockney comedian. Although he was against drink and gambling, he once jested memorably to a priest that all ordinary folk wanted to hear about in sermons was &#145;beer, work and football&#146;  (Jones, 105). He was no intellectual, but was an omnivorous reader of Dickens, Scott, and Bunyan. Instead of visiting the pub, he purchased Homer's <span class="italic">Iliad</span> for 2<i>d</i>. at a bookstall. He wrote several tracts on politics and religion, as well as one on cask making (1896).<br>
<br>Before the First World War, Will Crooks and George Lansbury were leading pioneers of the labour and socialist movement in Poplar. Crooks joined the Fabian Society in 1891, but his main backing for his election to the London county council (1892) and the Poplar board of guardians (1893) came from the Poplar labour electoral committee, formed by representatives from the new unions and progressive clergy. Later named the Poplar Labour League, this body established a voluntary Crooks wages fund, which gave him financial independence as a working-class politician. A Poplar councillor from 1900, he became mayor in 1901, the first Labour mayor in London. On the London county council up to 1910, he formed a Labour bench, which included Will Steadman and John Burns, and co-operated with middle-class Progressives. His causes included fair wages, open spaces, technical education, and the construction of the Blackwall Tunnel.<br>
<br>As Poplar guardians, despite being in a minority and sometimes at odds over policy, Lansbury and Crooks (who was chairman from 1897 to 1906) dominated the proceedings. Their radical measures, which used the poor law to reform the workhouse system and defend working-class living standards, marked the beginnings of &#145;Poplarism&#146; in the deprived East End. The resultant conflict with the municipal alliance of local ratepayers led to an official inquiry by the Local Government Board in 1906. In 1903, as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95367', "Labour Representation Committee")</script> candidate, Crooks won a sensational by-election at Woolwich, a tory constituency. Though he had enjoyed official Liberal support, his victory demonstrated the electoral potential of the newly founded Labour Party. Crooks was a hard-working constituency MP, interested in poor-law schooling, old-age pensions, and Woolwich arsenal issues. In 1905 Will and Elisabeth Crooks organized a march of 6000 working women to Westminster to lobby for unemployment assistance. He retained his seat in 1906 but lost it in January 1910, having arrived home on the eve of poll from New Zealand after a five-month recuperative world tour. Though victorious in December 1910, Crooks was now a controversial Labour politician, criticized by socialists for his continued links with Liberalism. In 1911 the Trades Union Congress roundly censured Crooks for not consulting the movement about his support for the <span class="roman">Labour Disputes Bill</span> to curtail strikes.<br>
<br>Although he had been a vigorous opponent of the South African War, the patriotic Crooks greeted British entry into the First World War by leading the singing of the national anthem in the House of Commons. A vice-president of the British Workers' National League, he toured extensively for recruitment and visited front-line troops. In 1916 George V made Crooks a privy councillor and visited him in hospital. He was re-elected unopposed in 1918, but extreme ill health ended Crooks's parliamentary career in February 1921, when he resigned his seat. He had never recovered from the horror of the bombing of a Poplar school in June 1917, when eighteen pupils perished. He died in Poplar Hospital on 5 June 1921 and was buried four days later in Tower Hamlets cemetery, after an impressive funeral service at All Saints' Church.<br>
<br>Popular with different social classes, Will Crooks was more typical of the early Lib&#150;Lab MPs in Labour history than his independent socialist contemporaries. No revolutionary theorist, he upheld the monarchy and empire. With a deep religious faith, he extolled the Victorian values of self-improvement and gradual reform. Above all, as an indefatigable and respected pioneer of working-class representation, he remained quintessentially an East End politician moulded by his practical experience of working life. In 1995 his neglected grave, with the original epitaph to the Labour servant of Poplar and Woolwich, was restored with a council grant of &pound;540.<br>
