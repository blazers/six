<span class="headword">Thomson, Sir  Charles Wyville</span>  (1830&#150;1882), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born on 5 March 1830 at Bonsyde, near Linlithgow, the son of Andrew Thomson, surgeon in the East India Company, and his wife, Sarah Ann Drummond Smith, daughter of Dr Wyville Smith, inspector of military hospitals. He was christened Wyville Thomas Charles, but appears to have used the forenames Charles Wyville throughout his adult life, adopting this form formally when he was knighted in 1876. His early education was at Merchiston Castle School and then at the University of Edinburgh where he became a medical student in 1845. However, he was more interested in biology and geology and, after three years of formal medical study, he devoted his efforts entirely to natural history, mainly under Robert Jameson.<br>
<br>In 1850, despite his lack of formal qualification, Thomson was appointed to a lectureship in botany at King's College, Aberdeen. In 1853 he became professor of natural history at Queen's College, Cork, and the same year married Jane Ramage Dawson, elder daughter of Adam Dawson, deputy lieutenant of the county of Linlithgow; their only son, Frank Wyville Thomson, was born about 1860. In 1854 Thomson was transferred to Queen's College, Belfast, as professor of mineralogy and geology, being appointed professor of natural history in 1862. To this post was added that of professor of botany at the Royal College of Science, Dublin, in 1868. Finally, having been elected to the fellowship of the Royal Society in 1869, he obtained the chair of natural history at the University of Edinburgh in 1870 and held this post until his death.<br>
<br>Thomson had broad interests and knowledge, not only in natural history but also in other sciences and in art and literature. His zoological interests were mainly with the invertebrates, initially the coelenterates and polyzoans, and subsequently the sponges and particularly the echinoderms. By the mid-1860s he was collaborating with the physiologist William Benjamin Carpenter on the structure and development of the sea lilies or crinoids, an echinoderm group well represented in the fossil record. Both men were also intrigued by the recent results counteracting Edward Forbes's azoic theory, according to which the deep ocean was totally devoid of life. The two interests came together when Thomson visited Michael Sars in Norway in 1867 and saw a variety of organisms dredged from deep water off the Lofoten islands, including a crinoid which resembled a form otherwise known only as a fossil. A request to the Royal Society, and thence to the Admiralty, for support for deep-ocean research resulted in a series of short cruises around the British Isles and into the Mediterranean, in the small paddle gun vessels HMS <i>Lightning</i> in 1868 and HMS <i>Porcupine</i> in 1869 and 1870. Thomson took part in most of these cruises and wrote a general account of the results in <span class="italic">The Depths of the Sea</span> (1873), a classic summary of oceanographic knowledge at the time.<br>
<br>These cruises finally dispelled the azoic theory, obtaining a variety of bottom-living animals in dredge hauls at depths down to 4289 metres in the Bay of Biscay, far deeper than any previous hauls. They also produced interesting physical results, particularly in the region to the south of the Faeroes where very different deep temperature measurements were obtained only a few miles apart. The &#145;warm&#146; and &#145;cold&#146; regions proved subsequently to be separated by a submarine ridge, named the Wyville Thomson Ridge in Thomson's honour.<br>
<br>The <i>Lightning</i> and <i>Porcupine</i> results were so impressive that Carpenter proposed a much larger undertaking, a properly equipped and staffed circumnavigation to investigate the physics, chemistry, geology, and biology of all the world's oceans. This time the Admiralty provided the 226 foot long steam-assisted screw corvette HMS <i>Challenger</i> under the command of Captain (later Sir) George Strong Nares. Since Carpenter was too old to take part in the voyage, the 41-year-old Thomson was appointed scientific director with a civilian staff of five including the naturalists John Murray and Henry Nottidge Moseley and the chemist John Young Buchanan.<br>
<br>The <i>Challenger</i> sailed from Portsmouth on 21 December 1872, returning to Spithead on 24 May 1876. In the meantime she had spent 713 days at sea and had covered 68,890 nautical miles through all the major oceans except the Indian. A total of 362 official &#145;stations&#146; had been occupied, more or less equally spaced along her track, obtaining soundings and samples of the bottom sediment, and taking serial measurements of the temperature and collecting water samples between the surface and the bottom. But above all the expedition collected biological specimens; mid-water nets were used to about 3000m deep, and bottom dredges and trawls were fished successfully twenty-five times at depths greater than about 4.5 km, the deepest from 5.7 km on the edge of the Japan trench in the western Pacific.<br>
<br>In recognition of the expedition's achievements, acknowledged as marking the beginning of the modern science of oceanography, Thomson was knighted and received a royal medal on the ship's return. He was also given responsibility for overseeing the working up of the specimens and the publication of the results in the official expedition <span class="italic">Reports</span>. In the face of considerable opposition, particularly from the authorities of the British Museum in London, he set up a Challenger office in Edinburgh where he resumed his university duties and in 1877 published an excellent account of the expedition's work as <span class="italic">The Voyage of the Challenger: the Atlantic</span> (2 vols.).<br>
<br>Thomson represented the University of Edinburgh at the tercentenary of the University of Uppsala in 1877 and was created a knight of the order of the Polar Star (Sweden). As president of the geography section of the British Association at its 1878 meeting in Dublin he was awarded an honorary LLD degree by Trinity College (having already received an honorary LLD in 1853 from Aberdeen, an LLD in 1860 and DSc in 1871 from Queen's University, Belfast, and a PhD from Jena).<br>
<br>In the meantime, the <i>Challenger</i>'s biological specimens had been sent out to an international galaxy of specialists to prepare the official <span class="italic">Reports</span>. Thomson published the introduction to the zoological series in 1880, and expected to see the remaining ten or twelve volumes through the press within five to ten years. In fact, the <span class="italic">Reports</span> ran to fifty volumes, the last not appearing until 1895. Although they all carry Thomson's name, they were edited mainly by his successor John Murray. For the strain of the <i>Challenger</i> expedition, the administration of the Challenger office, and Thomson's professorial duties, had taken their toll and he suffered recurring bouts of increasingly serious illness, particularly from the summer of 1879. He died at Bonsyde on 10 March 1882 and was survived by his wife.<br>
