<span class="headword">Delamotte,  Philip Henry</span>  (1821&#150;1889), <span class="occ">photographer and illustrator</span>, was born in Sandhurst, Surrey, on 21 April 1821, the fifth son in the family of five sons and four daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7435/', "William Delamotte (1775&#150;1863)")</script>, a drawing-master and watercolour painter, and his wife, Mary Anne Gage. His family was of Huguenot ancestry. Tutored by his father, who served as drawing-master at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Delamotte became skilful at drawing and engraving. Among his earliest recorded works were the illustrations to the catalogue of the objects shown at the 1850 exhibition of ancient and medieval art at the Society of Arts. On 4 August 1846, at Paddington, where he was then resident, he had married Ellen Maria, the daughter of Thomas George, a farmer. They had five daughters and a son.<br>
<br>Perhaps Delamotte's greatest contribution to the arts was as a pioneer photographer and photographic instructor, and he established himself as one of the most accomplished artists turned photographers of his generation. He was a main contributor to the photographic exhibition held in the great room of the Society of Arts in London in 1852, which was the first of its kind. In 1853 his manual <span class="italic">The Practice of Photography</span> was published by his sometime photographic collaborator Joseph Cundall, at whose Bond Street premises Delamotte held some of the first ever commercial photographic exhibitions and gave photographic instruction. The next year he displayed photographs of Ireland at the Society of Antiquaries. Delamotte was made a fellow of that society (6 May 1852) and also belonged to the Society of Arts and the Society of Artists, having exhibited a number of architectural drawings at the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>Among Delamotte's best-known commissions was the photography (undertaken weekly from 1851 to 1854) of the reconstruction of the Crystal Palace at Sydenham, where he displayed his skills of composition and perspective, applying the objectivity of the camera to produce masterly photographs that were artistically sound. The results were published in <span class="italic">Photographic Views of the Progress of the Crystal Palace, Sydenham</span> (2 vols., 1855). His landscape and portrait studies were equally successful. However, in 1855 he took up the post of professor of drawing at King's College, London, the duties of which he combined with book illustration. Over the next thirty years he wrote or illustrated more than seventy books. He also continued to give drawing lessons, and the grandchildren of Queen Victoria were among his pupils. In 1873 he published <span class="italic">The Art of Sketching from Nature</span>, a manual where he described the watercolour sketching technique, which he illustrated with his own lithographs; 1874 saw the publication of the <span class="italic">History of Holland House</span>, which was illustrated by his own carbon photographic prints. His versatility was shown in 1876 with the publication of the Buckland edition of <span class="italic">Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne</span> by Gilbert White, to which he contributed a charming series of bird and animal illustrations.<br>
<br>Delamotte was appointed to the chair of fine art at King's College, London, in 1879 and is remembered for introducing the admission of women to the art lectures. He continued to practise photography as a hobby until 1887, taking an &#145;unalloyed enjoyment of the art&#146;, much as he had done with his drawing and engraving.<br>
<br>Delamotte died of heart disease at the home of his son-in-law, Bromley Park School, Bromley, Kent, on 24 February 1889; he was recorded as having been latterly resident at Headley, Liphook, Hampshire.<br>
