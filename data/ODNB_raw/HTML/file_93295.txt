<span class="headword">Polakovs <span class="st"> [Poliakoff, Poliakov]</span>, Nicholai</span> <span class="st"> [<em>performing name </em>Coco]</span>  (1900?&#150;1974), <span class="occ">clown</span>, was believed to have been born near Riga, in Latvia in the Russian empire, probably on 5 October 1900, the son of Peter Polakovs, a cobbler who eked out his meagre living by working as a property master in the local theatre, where his mother was a wardrobe mistress. Nothing more is known about her. As a youngster he persuaded his father to allow him to follow a circus career, and during a four-year apprenticeship with the circus of Rudolpho Truzzi, an Italian who had settled in Russia, he learned the basics of acrobatics, tumbling, trapeze, and clowning. Truzzi gave him the stage name of Kokishka, meaning playful kitten, which was abbreviated to Koko and later rendered as Coco when he came to England.<br>
<br>While serving in the Russian army during the First World War Polakovs was an outrider with the 11th Siberian regiment in 1915, and was taken prisoner by the Bolsheviks during the Russian revolution, but escaped and rejoined the army. After the revolution he spent periods with the Red Army and then with the White, before deserting and joining a band of Mongolian gypsies, disguised as a girl. In June 1919 he married Valentina Novikova (1901&#150;1983), with whom he had four daughters and two sons. After the war he worked for various Russian circuses, and by 1926 had his own small circus in Lithuania, with a cast of twenty, but this broke up when he had a bad accident during an act that involved balancing a samovar of boiling water on his forehead. After spending months in hospital recovering from his injuries he accepted a contract from the German Circus Busch in Berlin in 1929 and also appeared in the Carl Zuckmayer film <span class="italic">Katharina Knie</span>. Through his agent, Wilschke, he was then offered a contract to perform in England, proferred by Willy Schumann, equestrian director and talent scout for the Bertram Mills circus, which he joined in Manchester, appearing for the show's Christmas season from 21 December 1929 to 18 January 1930. Such was his success that Mills offered him a contract for the first year of his new touring circus, the beginning of a thirty-seven-year association with the Mills circus.<br>
<br>Polakovs (who sometimes rendered his name Poliakoff or Poliakov) brought his wife and two eldest children to England at Easter 1930 for the opening of Bertram Mills' travelling circus. He enjoyed immediate success as a slapstick clown, water and paste being features of his act in the 1930s. Following the Christmas season of 1933&#150;4 he returned to Riga to collect his four remaining children. He never went back to Russia, remaining in Britain for the rest of his life and becoming a naturalized British subject. When the outbreak of the Second World War caused the suspension of the Bertram Mills circus, he worked briefly as a hotel porter, labourer, and a performer in pantomime, before enlisting in the Pioneer Corps, arranging shows at the garrison theatre at Sandwich, Kent. Invalided out of the forces with a damaged lung and arthritis, he was demobilized on 8 August 1941, and then worked for ENSA, performing in various theatres for the troops with his son Michael Polakovs (1923&#150;2009). In 1942 he and his son were engaged for the Blackpool Tower circus Easter and summer programmes, and were joined there in 1943 by his daughter Tamara. They remained in Blackpool for each summer and Easter programme until 1946, often sharing the limelight with the French clowns the Cairolis. During the winter season Coco and his family made appearances at the King's Hall Christmas circus at Belle Vue, Manchester, or toured with Tom Arnold's stage circus presentations.<br>
<br>In 1947, the year after Bertram Mills circus reopened, Coco and his family returned to Britain's &#145;Quality Show&#146;. He appeared on tour with Mills every summer thereafter until the closure of the touring show in October 1964 and at the Grand Hall, Olympia, London, each winter from 1947&#150;8 until the last Christmas show in the winter of 1966&#150;7. He had become an indispensable member of the Mills' clown team, working first with his children Michael, Sascha, and Tamara until they left to join Billy Smart's circus, but also with other members of the Mills clown equipe, including Percy Huxter, Alby Austin, and Jackie Sloan. His name became synonymous with that of the Bertram Mills circus and he quickly became its biggest star attraction in a branch of the entertainment industry that did not normally promote individuals as featured artistes. In the first of his two autobiographical books, he paid tribute to Mills for his commitment to reviving the role of clowns for twentieth-century circus audiences.<br>
<br>Coco became Britain's most famous and best-loved clown, known to millions of children around the country who, touchingly, sent their pocket money to assist him when in January 1953 he found himself in London's bankruptcy court because of an arrears of &pound;338 in income tax. In April 1957 he was hospitalized, and missed a performance in the sawdust ring for the first time in twenty-five years, when he was knocked down and injured by a jeep driven by Kam the elephant during a performance at Chelmsford. After he sustained further injuries in a road crash while touring in Scotland with Mills in 1959, it was feared that he might not work again, but he returned to the ring. Confined to bed with influenza in 1961, he made a miraculous recovery when he heard that a deputy had taken his place at Olympia Grand Hall for three performances. By then his appearances became confined to an entrance at the start of the show, with his trademark baggy suit, huge boots, red hair which could rise alarmingly, and a walking stick shaped like a Belisha beacon. In 1962 he was the subject of Eamonn Andrews's television programme <span class="italic">This is Your Life</span>.<br>
<br>As well as visiting sick children in hospitals in the towns visited by the Mills circus Coco lectured to schools on road safety, and was made OBE for this work in 1963. When the Mills Christmas shows at Olympia ceased, he concentrated on his road safety activities until returning to the circus world in 1974, when he toured with the Roberts Brothers' family show. During that tour he was taken ill with emphysema and bronchitis, and died in the District Hospital, Peterborough on 25 September 1974. Survived by his wife and their six children, he was buried in the parish churchyard at Woodnewton, Northamptonshire, on 27 September. A memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral (29 Nov 1974) was attended by many of his circus colleagues, and three generations of the Polakovs family.<br>
