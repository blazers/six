<span class="headword">Gifford,  (Charles) Henry</span>  (1913&#150;2003), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born on 17 June 1913 at 15 Vanbrugh Fields, Blackheath, London, the eldest of three sons of Walter Stanley Gifford (1884&#150;1960), mining engineer, and his wife, Constance Lena, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Henry (1886&#150;1945). His father was English (distantly related to Thomas Hardy's first wife, Emma Gifford) and his mother Welsh. He was educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he gained a second class in classical moderations in 1934, then changed to English, graduating with a second-class degree in 1936. He won the chancellor's English essay prize the same year. His first ambition was to make his mark as a writer. He wrote poetry and short stories up to the start of the Second World War, some of which were published privately.<br>
<br>Gifford's leaving Oxford coincided with the onset of the Spanish Civil War, and the flow of Spanish refugees into Britain. From 1936 to 1938 he worked at a camp set up for them at Arkley, near Barnet, north London. The experience led to his learning the language and a longstanding interest in the various literatures of the Spanish-speaking world. Aboard RMS <i>Homeric</i>, on a cruise in the Mediterranean putting in at Monte Carlo, he met (Mary) Rosamond van Ingen (1916&#150;2006), daughter of Eugene Melville van Ingen, businessman. She had been born in Mysore of Anglo-Dutch parents and raised in India. They later worked together at the camp and were married at Chelsea Old Church on 29 July 1938. They had a son, Nick, and a daughter, Anthea.<br>
<br>Gifford taught for a term at Eton College, but in 1940 was called up for military service. In February 1941 he was enrolled in the officer cadet training unit at Sandhurst, where he distinguished himself, and in June was commissioned into the 11th battalion of the Royal Tank regiment. At first he saw service as a tank commander in Egypt and Palestine. The tanks of that era needed regular servicing, which involved periods of enforced idleness. Gifford, however, had established contact with a veteran of the former Russian imperial guard, and during such interludes could be seen on his tank with a book of Russian grammar in his hands. Six weeks after D-day his tank regiment landed in Normandy, then proceeded through France, Belgium, Holland, and finally arrived in Germany, where he witnessed the demoralization of the Germans. At the end of the war he was employed in military education, instructing soldiers about to be demobilized. Education was to be his future career, and although his military service had revealed a more than competent soldier, on leaving the army in 1946 with the rank of captain he burnt his greatcoat and uniform as a mark of his true attitude to warfare and military life.<br>
<br>On demobilization Gifford was appointed assistant lecturer in English at the University of Bristol, and in 1963, under the departmental headship of Lionel Knights, became professor of English literature. For Gifford this was too narrow a definition of his role. His wide-ranging interest in other cultures made him a persuasive advocate of comparative literature. He championed the cause of Italian, offered as a subsidiary course to students of English, and in 1963 he was instrumental in setting up a small sub-department of Russian within the English department. Both these subjects went on to flourish when at a later stage a school of modern languages was established at Bristol. On Knights's move to Cambridge in 1967 Gifford was appointed to the Winterstoke chair, but in 1975 took up the specially created chair of English and comparative literature, which more closely reflected his interests. Although he retired the following year (1976) it was a very busy and productive retirement, in which he could indulge more freely in his admiration and interpretation of poets writing in Russian, Italian, Spanish, and modern Greek. From 1980 to 1984 he was general editor of the <span class="roman">Cambridge Studies in Russian Literature</span> series. In 1983 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy. In 1985 he gave the Clark lectures in Cambridge on &#145;Poetry in a divided world&#146;.<br>
<br>It was the Russian novel that first attracted Gifford's attention. In 1950 he published <span class="italic">The Hero of his Time: a Theme in Russian Literature</span> and in 1964 <span class="italic">The Novel in Russia</span>, followed by <span class="italic">Leo Tolstoy: a Critical Anthology</span> (1971) and a short monograph on Tolstoy in 1982. Poetry, however, was his great love, and his most important work was <span class="italic">Pasternak: a Critical Study</span> (1977), an informed and sensitive appreciation of the poet's development, culminating in the novel <span class="italic">Doctor Zhivago</span>. He had already collaborated with Charles Tomlinson on <span class="italic">Versions from Fyodor Tyutchev</span> (1960), and worked with him on translations of Aleksandr Pushkin and Vladislav Khodasevich as well as the Spanish poetry of Antonio Machado and C&eacute;sar Vallejo. He was particularly impressed by the poetry of Osip Mandelstam, as well as the Greek poet George Seferis. His wide reading gave him an insight into comparisons between the literature of diverse cultures.<br>
<br>Gifford's quick intelligence revealed itself in his lively demeanour, yet he was a sympathetic listener, of whom students always spoke highly. He died of bronchopneumonia and non-Hodgkins lymphoma on 23 November 2003 at Carlton Mansions care home in Apsley Road, Clifton, Bristol. He was survived by his wife and their two children.<br>
