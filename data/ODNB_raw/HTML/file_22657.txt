<span class="headword">Powle <span class="st"> [Powell]</span>,  Nathaniel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1622), <span class="occ">colonist in America</span>, was apparently the son of Thomas Powle of Holton St Mary, Suffolk. The parish register does not record his baptism but does include between 1593 and 1609 the baptisms of Thomas and five other children of Thomas Powle, and between 1627 and 1635 names four Nathaniels in the family. Details about his early life are unknown. He arrived in Virginia in 1607, being described as a gentleman.<br>
<br>In Virginia, Powle was busily employed. In February 1608 he attended Christopher Newport when the latter met Powhatan, leader of the neighbouring American Indians. Later in the year (July&#150;September) he accompanied Captain John Smith on his second exploration of Chesapeake Bay, and at the very end of the year he went with Smith to the Pamunkey Indians on the occasion when Smith outfaced Powhatan's military chief, Opechancanough. During this expedition he was sent to the Mangoaco in search of Sir Walter Ralegh's lost colony, but could only report that they were all dead. When Smith came to compose his account of these events, he made use of Powle's records.<br>
<br>As we know from his own report, Powle took part in 1616 in a punitive campaign against the Chickahomini Indians. On 20 October 1617 he was appointed sergeant-major-general in Virginia, and, commenting on his death, Smith later described him as &#145;a valiant Souldier&#146;  (Barbour, 2.295).<br>
<br>When Argall, the acting governor, left for England in early April 1619, he appointed Powle as his temporary replacement. Sir George Yeardley, the new governor, arrived within a fortnight and at once added Powle to his council, an appointment that the company confirmed when they issued instructions on 24 July 1621 to Sir Francis Wyatt, Yeardley's successor.<br>
<br>About this time Powle married Joyce Tracy (<i>d</i>. 1622), the daughter of another councillor, William Tracy, who had come to the colony with her parents in January 1621. In March 1622, when the Powhatan Indians launched their attack on the colony, Nathaniel and Joyce were living at Powle-brooke, his 600 acre estate at Bikers Point in Charles City county. Along with ten others at the settlement, both Powle and his pregnant wife were killed on 22 March. The attack ultimately saw the destruction of about one-sixth of the colony's population.<br>
<br>When the news reached England, Powle's brothers and sisters petitioned the company for his estate. Referring to him as &#145;a man of extraordinary merritt&#146; and to his siblings' poverty, the company's court instructed the council in Jamestown to take special care in the matter  (Kingsbury, 2.107), but clearly nothing was done at that time, for on 21 July 1626 Nathaniel's brother Thomas for himself and his &#145;poor distressed&#146; brothers and sisters asked the privy council for an order to the governor and council for the recovery of their brother's estate  (<span class="italic">CSP col.</span>, 1.81). It was then said to be in the hands of Mr Blany, who had married the widow of a William Powell, who was no kin to them. Ultimately they were successful: the Virginia land books record that on 12 February 1639 William Barker, mariner, and his associates bought from John Taylor, citizen and girdler of London, the estate in Virginia which Taylor had earlier bought from &#145;Thomas Powell, yeoman&#146;, of &#145;Howlton&#146; in Suffolk  (Nugent, 70, 100).<br>
