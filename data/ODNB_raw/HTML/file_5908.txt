<span class="headword">Collet,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1725&#150;1780), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in London, the son of a public office holder. He was a pupil of the landscape artist George Lambert, and also attended the St Martin's Lane Academy. His work was first exhibited in 1761 at the exhibition of the Free Society of Artists held in the Strand, in the form of three landscapes; in total forty-seven paintings by Collet would hang at the society's exhibitions between 1761 and 1783. The following year <span class="italic">A Gypsy Telling some Country Girls their Fortune</span> was submitted to the society, its title suggesting the direction in which Collet's style was developing, away from conventional landscapes towards humorous genre pieces. Frequent, if not always flattering, comparisons were drawn by contemporaries between Collet's work and that of William Hogarth, often citing a lack of moral guidance and instruction in the former's <i>&#339;uvre</i>: in his <span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painters</span> Edward Edwards notes &#145;pieces of humour &hellip; less satirical than narrative, more ludicrous than witty, and oftentimes displeasing&#146;  (Edwards, 67). Similarly an anonymous critic at the Free Society's exhibition of 1767 surmises that<blockquote>The colouring of Hogarth is here greatly excelled, his humour agreeably kept up, and was this painter not to follow him in his debauched scenes, but to keep to innocence only, he would be surpassed by none of his contemporaries. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1767)</blockquote>Despite the lack of moral instruction, Collet's work appears to have acquired an increasing popularity with the public and a number of publishers, including Robert Sayer and Carington Bowles, sold engravings after many of his paintings. A substantial selection of these prints can be found in the British Museum's collection of political and personal satires.<br>
<br>The habits and pretensions of the professional and middle classes were a popular subject for Collet's brush. Typical of this focus is <span class="italic">The Ladies' Disaster</span> (<i>c</i>.1771), engraved by James Caldwell, where the hat, cap, and wig of a fashionable young lady are blown into the arms of an amused onlooker. The often absurd intricacies of social etiquette were equally mocked by Collet in popular paintings such as <span class="italic">Grown Ladies Taught to Dance</span> and its companion piece <span class="italic">Grown Gentlemen Taught to Dance</span> (<i>c</i>.1768), both reproduced in mezzotint for Robert Sayer. The latter composition even found its way onto the stage, introduced as a sequence in a pantomime. Conversely the stage itself could prove a source of inspiration: in 1775 Collet produced a series of paintings based on several scenes, including <span class="italic">The Drinking Scene in the Convent</span>, from Richard Brinsley Sheridan's comedy <span class="italic">The Duenna</span>.<br>
<br>Collet's interest in social behaviour embraced not only the manners of the middle and upper classes; many of his paintings focus upon scenes of low life and debauchery set against London's urban sprawl. While producing paintings which illustrated the pleasures and pursuits of the capital's bourgeoisie, such as <span class="italic">Promenaders in St James's Park</span> (V&amp;A), Collet appears to have been equally adept at picturing less refined activities. In <span class="italic">Covent Garden Piazza and Market</span> (<i>c</i>.1775; Museum of London) the elegant and imposing fa&ccedil;ades of the piazza contrast sharply with a bustling m&eacute;lange of pickpockets, street musicians, hawkers, and traders. Finely drawn social distinctions, however, were often blurred to comic effect: in <span class="italic">May Morning</span> (<i>c</i>.1760; Museum of London) Collet presents a milkmaid sporting a silver-draped garland and a chimney-sweep parading in a gentleman's wig, such festivities and street customs temporarily challenging and reinterpreting the usual class structure.<br>
<br>In contrast to many of the personae within his paintings, Collet himself was considered to be &#145;a man of grave manners and conversation &hellip; [who] maintained a very respectable character&#146;, a respectability furthered by the inheritance of what contemporaries termed a &#145;fortune&#146; from a relative  (Edwards, 67). He appears to have remained a bachelor throughout his life. Formerly of Millman Street, Chelsea, London, he resided at Cheyne Row, Chelsea, where he died on 6 August 1780. His considerable estate was divided between the families of his two sisters, Philippa and Mary, and several close friends. He was buried at Chelsea on 11 August 1780.<br>
