<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pistrucci,  Benedetto</span>  (1783&#150;1855), <span class="occ">cameo cutter and medallist</span>, was born on 24 May 1783 in Rome, the second son of the three children of Federico Pistrucci and his wife, Antonia Greco. Both parents were Roman, Antonia the daughter of a wealthy merchant and Federico a judge of the criminal court and briefly a papal administrator in Bologna. Benedetto and his elder brother, Filippo, showed precocious talents, respectively for modelling in wax and for drawing, and after false starts Benedetto was placed with the cameo cutter Nicola Morelli. At the Scuola del Nudo (school of figure drawing) at the Campidoglio in Rome, where both drawing and modelling were taught, he took the first prize for sculpture in 1800. When he realized that his work was being sold by both his masters and the dealers as antique work with his signature removed, he began to place a privy mark of the Greek letter lambda in an obscure position on his cameos.<br>
<br>Declaring himself to be an independent master at the age of almost sixteen, from 1799 Pistrucci was receiving substantial commissions on his own account. His patrons included the dishonest dealer Ignazio Vescovali, and Napoleon's three sisters, Elisa Baciocchi, grand duchess of Lucca, Carolina Murat, queen of Naples, and Paolina Borghese. Pistrucci was so confident of making a career that he married Barbara Folchi, the daughter of a wealthy merchant, in 1802, when she was sixteen. They had nine children, born between 1803 and 1824. Two of them, Elena Pistrucci (1822&#150;1886) and Maria Elisa Pistrucci (1824&#150;1881), followed their father's profession as cameo cutters; the middle of three sons, Camillo Pistrucci (1811&#150;1854), was sent to Rome to be a pupil of the Danish neo-classical sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen.<br>
<br>The Roman dealer Bonelli persuaded Pistrucci in 1814 that his fortune lay in England, and during the journey there he found himself trapped in Paris owing to the brief return of Napoleon. Having worked for the Napoleonic courts in Italy, he was able to model Napoleon from life and to work for French patrons. Pistrucci arrived in England on 31 December 1815 armed with an introduction to Charles Dietrich K&ouml;nig, from 1813 keeper of natural history at the British Museum, who became a staunch friend, resolved problems of immigration, and arranged an introduction to Sir Joseph Banks, president of the Royal Society. During a session in which Pistrucci was modelling Banks, the writer and connoisseur Richard Payne Knight called to show a new treasure in his collection, a fragmentary cameo head of Flora. Pistrucci identified the stone cut for Bonelli in 1809 for less than &pound;5. Knight had bought the stone from Bonelli for &pound;100 and declared it &#145;the finest Greek cameo in existence&#146;  (Pistrucci, 182). Fortunately it bore Pistrucci's privy mark and the controversy quickly established his reputation in London. Banks commissioned three cameo heads of George III to be shown to Wellesley Pole, newly appointed as master of the Royal Mint. A request from Countess Spencer, for a cameo of St George and the dragon, was followed in June 1816 by Pole's commission for models for coinage, and Pistrucci proposed the St George and dragon design for some of the coin reverses.<br>
<br>On the death of Thomas Wyon on 22 September 1817, Pistrucci was offered the post of chief engraver at the mint at a salary of &pound;500 p.a., and a residence. Although the offer was not confirmed because of Pistrucci's status as an alien, he performed the duties of an engraver and took up residence. He was responsible for some of the models and dies for the gold and silver recoinage of George III and the new coinage of George IV, but after 1821 he cut no further coinage dies. The first and most important medal commission of his career was made in 1816 when the prince regent proposed a medal to commemorate the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo. The Royal Academy chose John Flaxman to submit designs, but the prince regent preferred the wax models by Pistrucci and he was thus formally commissioned to produce the work for an eventual fee of &pound;3500, payable as the work progressed. He had argued that the medal represented the labour of thirty normal medals and in 1843 he was still charging &pound;105 for a portrait medal die or marble bust. The Waterloo medal was to be 5.3 inches in diameter and was to be distributed in gold. Only completed in 1844 when a final payment was made to him, the dies were never hardened and the medal was only reproduced in electrotype. (The wax models remain in the Museo Numismatico della Zecca in Rome.) Pistrucci's friend W. P. Hamilton, then a government minister, suggested a medal for the acquisition of the Elgin marbles in 1817 by the government, though the project is recorded only in the wax models in Rome and in the cameo portrait head of the prince regent in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.<br>
<br>A compromise over Pistrucci's status was reached in 1828 by which William Wyon was appointed chief engraver, as he deserved to be, and Pistrucci became chief medallist. The salaries were reduced to &pound;300 p.a. with a &pound;50 allowance to Pistrucci for a pupil, an arrangement offensive to both artists. Pistrucci was refused permission to appoint his son Raffaele as his assistant in 1829. Until the compromise, Pistrucci had enjoyed &pound;500 p.a. and piece-rate payment for his models and dies for coinage. For example, he had earned &pound;1322 additionally in 1817, which included &pound;525 for the obverse and reverse of the new crown piece and &pound;315 for the reverse of the new gold sovereign  (TNA: PRO, Royal Mint 3/20; 3/23). Such a salary enabled him to have his family with him in London; known to have been with him in 1824 and 1842, the family's movements are not properly documented. Pistrucci's temperament did not foster good relations with his colleagues at the mint; the insecurity of his position there was deepened by a spasmodic but bitter campaign conducted through the newspapers by his partisans and those of William Wyon. He returned to Rome in 1839, probably to seek an appointment at the papal mint.<br>
<br>Pistrucci made fourteen medals altogether, of which five were official, including the coronation medals for George IV and Queen Victoria. His medals incorporate assured, individual effigies, among which are those of Lord Maryborough (1823) and the physician Sir Gilbert Blane (1830). His masterpiece, the Waterloo medal, shows Pistrucci's command of the types (or figures) of cameos, an understanding of the figurative language of the Roman Renaissance, and an appreciation of the antique sculptured relief&#151;his types, none the less, were always original. Regarding himself as principally a cameo maker, his integrity and invention enabled him to charge &pound;950 for a work and gave him a steady patronage in Britain until his death. Eighty-one cameos are documented, of which only forty-eight have been found. The original models for his coins, medals, and cameos are preserved in Rome in a collection of 396 waxes in the Museo Numismatico della Zecca.<br>
<br>Pistrucci was also a monumental sculptor and eleven signed portrait busts by him are recorded, including one of the duke of Wellington (1832), and five subject sculptures; a lost bust is documented of the greatest soprano in Europe at the time, Giuditta Pasta. In style the busts may be placed between the work of Lorenzo Bartolini in Italy and Sir Francis Chantrey in England. Benedetto Pistrucci died at his home, Flora Lodge, Englefield Green, Surrey, on 16 September 1855 and was buried on the 20th in the cemetery of Christ Church, Virginia Water, Surrey.<br>
