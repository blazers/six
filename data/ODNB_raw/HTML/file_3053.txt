<span class="headword">Bowes,  John</span>  (1804&#150;1874), <span class="occ">preacher and author</span>, was born on 12 June 1804 in Swineside, Coverham parish, Yorkshire, the son of a farmer. Bowes joined the Wesleyan Methodists in 1817 but, while working for a brewer in Leyburn, he transferred to the Primitive Methodists because of their revivalist successes, becoming a circuit preacher in 1822. He married Susannah Bellwood, a farmer's daughter, on 26 September 1826 and they had several children. One son, Robert Aitken Bowes (1836&#150;1879), became editor of the <span class="italic">Bolton Guardian</span>. Bowes was assigned to the church's Edinburgh mission, where he became embroiled in a local dispute over the order in belief of faith and reason: he gave priority to the former. Deciding that all religious denominations were sectarian, Bowes helped form the Christian Mission, becoming pastor of its Dundee congregation in 1830. His book <span class="italic">Christian Union</span> (1835) showed his increasing undenominationalism. After attempting union with various free methodist bodies, he moved to Liverpool to assist the Revd Robert Aitken, but this association was short-lived. In 1839 he made contact with the (Plymouth) Brethren, and adopted their ecclesiology. Bowes's pamphlet <span class="italic">A Hired Ministry Unscriptural</span> (1842) showed his extreme anticlericalism, and he became dependent on free-will offerings for his income. Possessing a strong physique and a powerful voice, he was frequently in conflict with the authorities over his street preaching. A tireless itinerant, he devoted the rest of his life to travelling throughout Britain and to pastoring churches in Aberdeen (1841&#150;4), Manchester (1844&#150;52), Cheltenham (1852&#150;9), and Dundee (1859&#150;74).<br>
<br>A vigorous controversialist, Bowes held public debates with, among others, the secularist G. J. Holyoake, the freethinker Charles Bradlaugh, the Swedenborgian Woodville Woodman, and the Church of Christ leader T. H. Milner. He published his debates as well as strictures on movements such as Mormonism and socialism. He espoused pacifism, total abstinence, vegetarianism, and other adjuncts to healthy living. He denied any ecclesiastical affiliations and when challenged to declare his church he claimed, &#145;No section, I belong to the whole church&#146;  (<span class="italic">Truth Promoter</span>, 1, 1851, 166&#150;7). However, many of Bowes's concerns can be paralleled among individuals such as Joseph Barker and William Trotter in England and Hugh Hart and J. A. Begg in Scotland. A number of the congregations with which he was in contact in the north of England and in Scotland were assimilated into the Open Brethren movement. He was part of the democratization of popular religion which led to a greater desire for ecclesiastical autonomy and, as such, he was an important pioneer of the Brethren among the lower-middle and working classes.<br>
<br>Bowes wrote some 220 tracts during his life (most of them no longer extant). He published two journals, the <span class="italic">Christian Magazine</span> (1842&#150;51) and the <span class="italic">Truth Promoter</span> (1849&#150;75). He also translated the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> from Greek into English (1870), although it is uncertain how full his knowledge of Greek was, and published an <span class="italic">Autobiography</span> (1872). He died of bronchitis on 23 September 1874 in Dundee, where he was buried in an unmarked grave.<br>
