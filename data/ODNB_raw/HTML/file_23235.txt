<span class="headword">Reading,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1685&#150;1764), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, was perhaps the son of the John Reading (<i>d</i>. 1692) who was master of the choristers at Lincoln (<i>c</i>.1670&#150;1675) before becoming organist at Winchester, first at the cathedral (1675&#150;81) and then at the college (1681&#150;92). But there were other musical Readings in London who might also have been the boy's father: Balthazar, bass in the Chapel Royal, Valentine, a string player in the private musick (both <i>fl</i>. 1685&#150;8), and another John (<i>fl</i>. 1684&#150;1717), a bass theatre singer. The younger John Reading was a choirboy in the Chapel Royal and a pupil of John Blow; warrants at his dismissal are dated 22 December 1699. Although not officially appointed because of difficulties with his predecessor, he was organist at Dulwich College between March 1700 and 26 September 1702 and retained a close and friendly association with the college all his life. From 21 November 1702 he served as a junior vicar and poor clerk at Lincoln Cathedral, becoming master of the children there on 5 October 1703. No further mention of him at Lincoln occurs after 1705.<br>
<br>On 13 April 1703 John Reading of St Margaret's, Lincoln, married Ann Corbet of St Andrew's, Holborn, at St Mary Magdalen, Old Fish Street, London. On 1 December 1707 he witnessed the death of Jeremiah Clarke, who shot himself in his house in St Paul's Churchyard; Sir John Hawkins records that Reading &#145;was passing by at the instant the pistol went off, and entering the house found his friend in the agonies of death.&#146; He was elected as organist at St John's, Hackney, on 28 January 1708. In 1718 questions were raised about his absence from his post, and on 12 December 1719 he was threatened with dismissal, having been reprimanded concerning<blockquote>irregularities relating to the execution of his Office as Organist of this Parish, and particularly for playing the Voluntary too long, and using persistently too light, Airy and Jyggy Tunes, no ways proper to raise the Devotion Suitable for a Religeous Assembly. (LMA, P79/JNI/140)</blockquote>Having promised &#145;to amend&#146;  (ibid.) at a hearing on 19 April 1720, he continued serving at St John's until 4 April 1727, when he was ordered &#145;to provide himself with another place&#146;  (LMA, P79/JNI/141, fol. 63<i>r</i>) within three months.<br>
<br>In 1719 he became the first teacher of John Stanley. During his time at St John's he had published <span class="italic">A Book of New Songs (after the Italian Manner)</span> (<i>c</i>.1710), when he was living at Arundel Street, Strand, and <span class="italic">A Book of New Anthems</span> (<i>c</i>.1715), by which time he had moved to &#145;Swan passage in Orrange Street near Red-Lyon Square in Holborne&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Book of New Anthems</span>, title-page). In his early years he was an enthusiast for the Italian style and hoped that his <span class="italic">Book of New Songs</span> would &#145;incite our Great masters to improve the Design to such perfection that our English Composers might be inspired with the utmost delicacy of a <i>Roman Genius</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Book of New Songs</span>, preface). The <span class="italic">Book of New Anthems</span> comprises six multi-movement works in modern style, employing solo voices and incorporating elaborate instrumental interludes. The reprimand received by Reading for his &#145;light, Airy and Jyggy Tunes&#146; is at odds with his keyboard music, sober in nature and skilfully written. His organ voluntaries helped set the pattern for later composers like Stanley, with a slow opening movement followed by a brisk or fugal one. Reading was not only a composer but also an assiduous compiler of collections of keyboard music and of songs. Seventeen manuscript volumes of these collections survive, some very large, most of which Reading bequeathed to Dulwich College. They include some of the most important sources for English organ music of the period.<br>
<br>On 30 June 1727 Reading became organist at St Mary Woolnoth with St Mary Woolchurch, with an annual fee of &pound;20 (which dropped to &pound;12 in 1758), and on 9 April 1731 he added the position of organist at St Dunstan-in-the-West (fee &pound;21 p.a.); he held both places until his death. He was a founder member of the Royal Society of Musicians in August 1739. Reading died on 2 September 1764, aged eighty-seven according to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, but this seems about ten years too old for his service as choirboy in the Chapel Royal.<br>
