<span class="headword">Folville,  Eustace</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1346), <span class="occ">gangster and soldier</span>, was the second of the seven sons of John Folville (<i>d</i>. 1310), lord of Ashby Folville in Leicestershire, and his wife, Alice. He came of an established gentry family. The John Folville who was a king's banneret in 1286, and was knight of the shire for either Leicestershire or Rutland, or both together, six times between 1298 and 1306, was probably his father; the Ralph Folville who was knight of the shire for Leicestershire in 1315 was doubtless a relative. There is no unequivocal evidence linking the Folville family with criminality before Eustace's generation, but it is at least interesting that in 1284 John Folville appealed one Gillian Crumbaud of involvement in the killing on 30 November 1276 of her husband, Eustace de Folville, who was also his father; Gillian, who was presumably John's stepmother, was acquitted, though a man was outlawed for the crime. Then in 1292 John was himself accused by an approver at Reading of having harboured his own brother Robert, killed in the company of thieves. But again the charge was dismissed&#151;Robert had been killed by, not with, thieves.<br>
<br>Of Eustace Folville's own involvement in felony there can be no doubt. On 19 January 1326, with his brothers Robert and Walter, and perhaps fifty other men, he committed one of the most sensational crimes of an exceptionally disorderly decade, when they waylaid and murdered <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1985/', "Sir Roger Beler")</script>, a baron of the exchequer, at Rearsby, Leicestershire. The context of the deed was political: Beler was a former Lancastrian who had become a leading agent of the Despensers, and had made many bitter enemies as a result. Among those enemies were members of the Zouche family, one of whom struck the fatal blow, and apparently also the Folvilles themselves. But once the deed was done, perhaps because they were outlawed in consequence, Eustace and his followers became full-time criminals. A series of pardons&#151;one early in 1327, another in 1329&#151;made no difference; they continued to kill, kidnap, and rob. Eustace himself was said to have been implicated in three or four murders, a rape, and three robberies between 1327 and 1330. Then, on 14 January 1332 he led what was now a criminal band (one that included four of his own brothers) in an exploit as startling as the murder of Beler, when they kidnapped <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29601/', "Sir Richard Willoughby")</script>, a justice of the court of common pleas, and allegedly notorious for corruption, and held him to ransom for 1300 marks (&pound;866 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.).<br>
<br>In this and some of his other misdeeds Folville co-operated with the gang led by James Coterel, which was based in Derbyshire but was prepared to engage in crime elsewhere; and the Coterels, in their turn, gave Folville shelter when necessary. Folville also had friends among the ostensibly law-abiding, who may have hired him and his company to commit acts of violence on their behalf&#151;precisely this charge was brought against a group that included a canon of Sempringham Priory, Lincolnshire, and the cellarer of Haverholm Abbey, also in Lincolnshire. Their pardons in the late 1320s suggest that the Folvilles could look for support somewhere in the regime of Mortimer and Isabella. More specifically, Eustace and two of his brothers wore the robes of Sir Robert Tuchet, lord of Markeaton, Derbyshire, and Ashwell, Rutland, and they numbered the constable of Rockingham Castle, Northamptonshire, among their associates. The activities of the Folvilles helped to inspire a government campaign against criminals in 1332, which as far as Eustace was concerned had very little effect. He was brought back into the ranks of the law-abiding in a manner characteristic of the later middle ages, by a pardon granted in 1333 in consideration of military service in Scotland. His skills in violence were called upon again for campaigns in Scotland in 1337, and in Flanders in 1338. In the following year he became a member of the abbot of Crowland's council, receiving 20<i>s</i>. per annum for life in return for aid and advice. Whether his services were genuine is unknown, and it is possible that the fee represented a form of protection money&#151;in either 1340 or 1341 his brother Richard was killed as a criminal resisting arrest outside the parish church of Teigh, Rutland, of which he was rector.<br>
<br>Eustace Folville died unmolested in 1346. His passing was noticed by the chronicler Henry Knighton, who described him simply as &#145;Eustace de Folville, who slew Robert [<i>sic</i>] Bellers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Knighton's Chronicle</span>, 77). To present-day eyes Folville's career provides a perfect illustration of the weakness of authority and the ineffectiveness of law enforcement in the first half of the fourteenth century. To his own contemporaries, aware of the ill repute of his principal victims, he presented a more ambiguous image. Consequently he was remembered as an enforcer of rough justice as well as a lawbreaker. In William Langland's <span class="italic">Piers Plowman</span>, written over thirty years after the gangster's death, part of the process of setting the world to rights consists of what has been unrighteously taken being forcibly recovered, &#145;fro fals men with Foluyles lawes&#146;  (Langland, 1.564).<br>
