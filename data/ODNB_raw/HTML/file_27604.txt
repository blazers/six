<span class="headword">Towneley,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1697, <em>d.</em> 1782), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was baptized on 1 January 1697 at St Peter's Church, Burnley, Lancashire, the second son of Charles Towneley (1658&#150;1712) of Towneley Hall, Lancashire, and his wife, Ursula, daughter of Richard Fermor of Tusmore, Oxfordshire. His brother was the Jacobite officer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27603/', "Francis Towneley")</script>, executed in London in 1746. John Towneley entered Gray's Inn on 14 March 1715 and studied law under William Salkeld, serjeant-at-law. At his father's death in 1711 he was left with an allowance of only &pound;60 a year. About 1728 he moved to Paris where female members of his family had been pupils or nuns. There, according to his great-nephew Charles Towneley, he frequented literary society and joined the salon of Madame Doublet de Breuilpont.<br>
<br>In 1731 Towneley entered Rothers's Franco-Irish infantry regiment as lieutenant; he distinguished himself at the siege of Phillipsburg in 1734, and became a captain in 1735. In 1745 his regiment, or a detachment of it, was sent to Scotland to assist Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender, and Towneley took part in the battle of Falkirk. The French envoy, the marquis d'&Eacute;guilles, in a dispatch to Bachaumont, wrote on 20 February 1746: &#145;M. Townly, who will have the honour of delivering my despatches to you, is the man of most intelligence and prudence amongst those here with the prince: you may question him on any subject&#146;  (Cottin, 28). In the autumn of 1746 Towneley, with forty-two other Jacobite officers, received a grant of 1200 livres from Louis XV. In December he received the order of St Louis.<br>
<br>According to Charles Towneley, on the publication of Samuel Butler's <span class="italic">Hudibras</span> (1662&#150;80) &#145;every real or pretended man of letters chattered on the subject&#146;  (<span class="italic">Palatine Note-Book</span>, 1.27), no doubt thanks to Voltaire's discussion of the poem in two articles of the <span class="italic">Dictionnaire philosophique</span>. Piqued by Voltaire's description of it as untranslatable except by reducing &#145;three quarters of the passage to be translated&#146;  (<span class="italic">M&eacute;langes</span>, 174), Towneley began translating passages for the amusement of Madame Doublet's society. John Turberville Needham, his great-nephew's tutor, eventually persuaded him to complete the translation and to publish it. Towneley's <span class="italic">Hudibras</span> was published anonymously in Paris in 1757, although the frontispiece indicated London as the place of publication, a stratagem to avoid censorship. The English original is given on parallel pages, and Hogarth's engravings are reproduced. The preface is by Towneley while the explanatory notes appended are by Pierre Larcher, the translator of Herodotus. A second edition, with the English text revised by Sir John Byerly and the French spelling modernized, was printed by Firmin-Didot in Paris in 1819. This also included a &#145;Notice sur J. Towneley&#146;, translated from an appendix to the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span>.<br>
<br>Although the editor of the 1815 edition calls Towneley's work &#145;rather an imitation than a translation&#146;, it aims at being very close to the original. It was extravagantly praised by Horace Walpole. The <span class="italic">Nouvelle biblioth&egrave;que d'un homme de go&ucirc;t</span> (1777) taxed it with bad rhymes and faulty French  (1.216&#150;17), while Suard, in the <span class="italic">Biographie universelle</span>, though acknowledging its fidelity, pronounces the diction poor and the verses unpoetical, &#145;the work of a foreigner familiar with French but unable to write it with elegance&#146;. It lacks the swing and burlesque rhymes of the original and Towneley himself declared the &#145;humour untranslatable&#146;.<br>
<br>Towneley died at Chiswick in 1782, at the residence of his nephew, also John Towneley (1731&#150;1813), a noted book collector, and was buried in Chiswick churchyard. The first sale of the Towneley library took place after his nephew's death in 1813; there was a second sale in 1883. The elder Towneley possessed a considerable collection of Wenceslaus Hollar's prints, which were sold by auction in 1818. The sale also included some of his fragmentary manuscripts.<br>
