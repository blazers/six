<span class="headword">Bailey, Sir  George Edwin</span>  (1879&#150;1965), <span class="occ">electrical engineer and industrialist</span>, was born in Loughborough on 19 October 1879, the tenth child of Thomas W. Bailey, master tailor, and his second wife, Ann Wilmot. He was educated at Loughborough grammar school, and entered the works of the Brush Electrical Engineering Company, Loughborough, as an apprentice, continuing his technical education at the University College, Nottingham. After a period as leading turbine draughtsman, he left the Brush Company in 1907 and joined the British Westinghouse Company at Trafford Park, Manchester, as a draughtsman in the engine department, rising to chief draughtsman in 1909. He married, in 1910, Margaret Fanny (<i>d</i>. 1971), daughter of Thomas Bolesworth, farmer, of Loughborough; they had one daughter. In 1913 Bailey became superintendent of the engine department, and was later responsible for manufacture; this determined his future career and interest in production and manufacture. During the First World War, British Westinghouse raised a body of defence volunteers at Trafford Park, captained by Bailey.<br>
<br>In 1919 British Westinghouse became the Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company, a name which was to become known throughout the world. Bailey was appointed as works manager, and in 1927 took a seat on the board, becoming director and general manager of manufacture.<br>
<br>In 1929 Metropolitan-Vickers was merged with the British Thomson-Houston Company and the Ediswan Electric Company to form Associated Electrical Industries Limited. Although the individual companies retained their own identities, Bailey was made responsible for the co-ordination of production in the group. In 1938 the company was involved with Robert Watson-Watt in producing the first radar sets, and George Bailey was proud to be involved with many technical developments in heavy-bomber production, with the first axial flow gas turbine to fly (the forerunner of the jet), and with much equipment for the navy and air force, including the first thousand radar sets ordered by the government. In what he regarded as &#145;the engineers' war&#146;, Bailey led the company through a great manufacturing programme. On 22 December 1940 the Trafford Park works was heavily bombed, but under Bailey's direction tools and materials were obtained from elsewhere and production resumed with little interruption. For his service during the war Bailey was knighted in 1944. The same year, he was appointed chairman of Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company.<br>
<br>In the following two years Bailey became managing director, and then deputy chairman, of Associated Electrical Industries. In 1951 Oliver Lyttelton (later Lord Chandos) entered the government as secretary of state for the colonies and Bailey took his place as chairman of the company until 1954, when Chandos returned, after which Bailey continued as director, retiring in 1957.<br>
<br>Bailey was a man of strong character, and it was undoubtedly his great energy and single-mindedness that caused him to be chosen for heavy responsibility in his early years. He was notable for his ability to handle men, and, despite his critical outlook and sometimes more than trenchant comments, he left no rancour. He was adept at devising various ways of maintaining good communications with his employees and his relations with the trade unions, although robust, were always sincere, and caused no ill feelings. The company boasted what was probably the first works committee in the country, anticipating the Whitley councils by nine months. Although Bailey regarded himself as a very hard man, he was far more sympathetic and sentimental about other people's misfortunes than he cared to admit, and often arranged for help to be given anonymously. He gave unremitting support for a wide range of extramural activities for the company's employees, such as choral singing, amateur dramatics, and boxing. He also assiduously encouraged an evening school, which offered tuition for women and girls in cookery, sewing, and dressmaking.<br>
<br>During the war Bailey served as a member of the engineering and industrial panel of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, and as a member of the committee which considered the position of skilled men in industry, led by Sir W. H. Beveridge, as well as serving on the industrial panel of the Ministry of Production. At various times he was president of the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers' Association, the Engineering and Allied Employers' National Federation, the Manchester District Engineering Employers' Association, the Manchester Engineering Council, and the Institute of Production Engineers. His skill and wide experience were used to the full after the blitz on Manchester, in supervising the restoration of badly damaged factories in the district. His contribution to the Manchester Defence scheme earned him the appointment of CBE in 1941.<br>
<br>Despite his heavy responsibilities and the many calls on his time, Bailey never lost interest in golf, fishing, and gardening. Like his father before him, he was a good gardener and his chief interest was in the cultivation of carnations, in which he specialized. Bailey died at his home, Downside, Compton, Berkshire, on 14 October 1965.<br>
