<span class="headword">Etheridge,  Richard Albert <span class="st"> [Dick]</span></span>  (1909&#150;1985), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 27 December 1909 in Halesowen, son of Alfred and Berthie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rudge. Shortly afterwards the family moved to Birmingham, where Alfred ran a caf&eacute;. Dick attended St Thomas's School and Handsworth Technical School. His first job was with a chemist; in 1928 he moved to a garage, but when this closed during the depression, he moved into the family caf&eacute; business. In 1933 he married Lily May Thomas. They set up home in Halesowen and had three children.<br>
<br>In 1933 Etheridge became a clandestine communist. The typical Black Country combination of radicalism, economic enterprise, and deep alienation that formed his cultural inheritance seems to have been transmitted largely by his grandmother, a second-hand clothes dealer. During the 1930s he was secretary of the Halesowen Trades Council and a Labour Party member. He became an open communist about 1938.<br>
<br>In 1940 Etheridge went to work at Austin's Longbridge works as a lathe operator. He joined the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) and in 1941 was elected a shop steward. During the war years he took correspondence courses with the National Council of Labour Colleges. These taught him committee and secretarial skills. In 1945 he became convener of the shop stewards' works committee. After the war, despite a considerable increase in union membership, the works committee was still not strongly established. There was a continuing conflict between the AEU and the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU), and the latter withdrew its shop stewards from the works committee. The 1951 &#145;Pegg and Bills&#146; strike over the dismissal of two National Union of Vehicle Builders (NUVB) shop stewards foundered on the rock of inter-union strife. TGWU members returned to work, saying that Etheridge was only interested in his communist &#145;comrade&#146;, Sid Pegg: TGWU leaders disregarded the fact that Bills, the other NUVB shop steward dismissed, was not a communist. Etheridge, as convener, involved the works committee in campaigns that emphasized the common interests of the workforce. One related to canteen facilities and another to transport to work. More fundamental was the reduction of working hours to forty-two per week.<br>
<br>Etheridge was active in the Communist Party's Halesowen branch and on the Birmingham and midland committees. In 1950 he stood unsuccessfully for parliament in Birmingham, Northfield. He played a major part in formulating Communist policy on the motor industry. From 1961 to 1973 he was a member of the national executive committee. In the AEU he served on the Birmingham district committee and as a member of no. 16 divisional committee. In 1958 and on five occasions subsequently he was elected to the union's annual policy-making national committee. From 1963 to 1974 he was a member of the AEU's delegation to the TUC. From 1965 until 1975 he was president of the Birmingham west district.<br>
<br>In 1956 there were major strikes at Norton, Standard Motors, and British Motor Corporation (BMC) concerning automation and redundancies. Etheridge played a major role in the BMC strike. To him the partial victory achieved was less important than the simple fact of united action by members of all unions.<br>
<br>When the controversy over Hungary broke out in 1956, Etheridge's first priority was to maintain the unity of the Austin works committee. He persuaded them to refuse to discuss the issue on the grounds that it was political. Etheridge's position at Longbridge was not entirely secure in his first ten years as convener. His communist views naturally provoked hostility on the part of supervisors and senior management. None the less, his role in mediating between rival unions (particularly in brokering a labour mobility agreement under the terms of which only tiny parts of the plant were to be the exclusive preserve of any one union) and in articulating grievances before they reached a critical phase was sufficiently appreciated to protect him from dismissal. From the late 1950s his employers provided him with an ever greater degree of recognition within the plant and with steadily enhanced facilities. In the late 1940s he had had to obtain permission every time he wished to leave his machine; by the 1960s he was a full-time convener with an office, telephone, and unrestricted access to all areas of the plant. Contemporaries commented that his was the best-known face at Longbridge.<br>
<br>During the 1960s Etheridge and the works committee faced a recurring crisis of confidence in respect of labourers, storemen, and other &#145;indirect&#146; workers (those not employed directly on the production lines) at Longbridge. The indirect workers repeatedly ignored the plant's internal procedures and committee. Etheridge was unable to resolve this problem. In 1968 he became co-chairman of the federal British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC) shop stewards' committee. Two matters dominated the remainder of his working life. One was the negotiation of a new BLMC wage structure, a variant of measured day work. Only when the principle of mutuality was introduced did the shop stewards accept the new system. The second was industrial relations legislation.<br>
<br>As Longbridge convener, Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers district president and TUC delegate, and Communist national executive committee member, Etheridge played a significant role in the campaign which eventually made the <span class="roman">Industrial Relations Act</span> of 1971 inoperable. He and the Longbridge works committee supported the unofficial Liaison Committee for the Defence of Trade Unions which played an important role in co-ordinating and stimulating the activities of shop stewards and rank-and-file opponents.<br>
<br>Etheridge retired on 21 February 1975. Over the years he devoted much time and effort to writing, broadcasting, public speaking, and lecturing. Much of his public speaking was undertaken at AEU branch dinners and socials. From the early 1960s he was regularly invited to rotary clubs, discussion groups, and, increasingly, colleges (to lecture on industrial relations). During the 1960s and 1970s he was frequently interviewed on television and radio.<br>
<br>A teetotaller, non-smoker, and non-gambler but a great trencherman, Etheridge was fascinated by Black Country lore. His favourite authors were Gorky, Jerome K. Jerome, and Kipling. For many years he took family holidays near Aberystwyth in a caravan that he built himself. He also travelled overseas, visiting Cuba, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Germany. Over 6 feet tall, broad-shouldered, and robust, Etheridge was accustomed to good health. For many years, however, he had to wear spectacles and his eyesight began to fail several years before his death. He died at Halesowen on 17 March 1985, following two severe strokes.<br>
