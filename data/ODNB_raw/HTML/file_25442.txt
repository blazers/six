<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Shirley,  William</span>  (1694&#150;1771), <span class="occ">colonial governor and army officer</span>, was born on 2 December 1694 at Preston, Sussex, the son of William Shirley (1667&#150;1701), London merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of John Godman of Ote Hall, Wivelsfield, Sussex. He grew up in a family with aristocratic pretensions but without the economic wherewithal to support that style of life. His father died when he was very young, and William was left with relatively little property. He attended the Merchant Taylors' School in London and Pembroke College, Cambridge, as a pensioner, graduating BA in 1715. He entered the Inner Temple in 1714 and was called to the bar on 20 July 1720, practising law for the next eleven years. He was a clerk in the London government from 1717 to 1719. Some time before 1720 he married Frances, daughter and heir of Francis Barker, a London merchant. They had nine children before she died on 31 August 1745. A daughter, Frances, also died in 1745. Although he achieved a good legal reputation and made a number of influential friends, he did not prosper financially. He lost money on the South Sea Bubble and other speculative fiascos, and grew determined to recoup his fortunes in American colonial administration.<br>
<br>In 1731 Shirley emigrated with his family to Boston, Massachusetts, seeking a place in government. Before long he had secured the patronage of his friend Thomas Pelham-Holles, duke of Newcastle, who had connections in the ministry of Sir Robert Walpole. In 1733 Shirley was appointed judge of the vice-admiralty court and shortly thereafter advocate-general of that court. He vigorously attempted to enforce British trade laws while also developing a private law practice and petitioning officials in London for various offices without success. He became associated with a group of colonial businessmen and landowners who were opposed to the governor, Jonathan Belcher, and he began to undermine Belcher's position. He dispatched his wife to England with instructions to petition the duke of Newcastle, then secretary of state, for various offices and emoluments for him. After she had made several unsuccessful attempts, she began disparaging Belcher and petitioning for her husband's appointment in his stead. With the assistance of powerful allies in both London and Boston, she succeeded on 25 May 1741 in having Belcher dismissed and Shirley commissioned governor of Massachusetts.<br>
<br>Confronted with economic difficulties left to him by his predecessor, Shirley rose to the occasion and quickly established a reputation as an astute servant of the crown. He eliminated various competing banks and restored a sound currency without antagonizing anyone unduly, thereby winning the respect of both the colonists and his superiors in London. Building on this success, he forged a powerful following in Massachusetts by gaining privileges for leading colonists from the British government in exchange for their co-operation. He secured for them war contracts for provisions, military commissions, and civil positions, and prevailed upon Newcastle to relax enforcement of the trade laws. He also built up the colony's defences by persuading the general court to appropriate money for the repair of Castle William and other fortifications in Massachusetts. Hence, when Britain declared war upon France in 1744, he had put the colony on a sound financial footing and in a reasonable state of defence. Seeing the war as an opportunity to improve the colonists' strategic and economic situation, he urged the ministry to seize the weakly held French fortress of Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island. Undeterred by the lack of support or encouragement from Britain, he proposed to the general court of Massachusetts that an expedition be organized by the New England colonies. He ably negotiated with all the parties to cobble together an expedition, to be led by William Pepperrell with the assistance of a British fleet under Commodore Peter Warren. The fortress fell on 17 June 1745, and Shirley was rewarded by being appointed colonel of a British regiment to be recruited from New England provincial troops. In the late 1740s he used hard currency provided by parliament as reimbursement for war expenses to replace some of the paper money of Massachusetts.<br>
<br>The war ended in 1748, and a year later Shirley was appointed to a commission meeting in Paris to determine the boundary between New England and French Canada. Shortly after his arrival in France he married a young Frenchwoman named Julie, the daughter of his landlord; they had no children. The negotiations went on interminably, with Shirley attempting to push the boundaries of British North America into the Ohio valley. Sensing that war between Britain and France would soon break out again, he returned to Massachusetts in 1753. In January 1754 he wrote to the ministry in London, urging the necessity of uniting the colonies and emphasizing the importance of Crown Point (Ticonderoga) to colonial defence. In the summer he led an expedition up the Kennebec River, vainly seeking Frenchmen to fight, and he laid plans to attack the French in eastern Canada. In February 1755 he was promoted major-general, as the British ministry laid plans for all-out war with the French in America. Two months later he attended a council of war with the commander of the British forces in America, General Edward Braddock, and four other governors in Alexandria, Virginia, where a concerted plan of action against the French was agreed upon. Braddock appointed Shirley his second-in-command, then marched against Fort Duquesne while Shirley led an unsuccessful expedition against Niagara. When Braddock was killed in a French ambush in July 1755, Shirley became commander-in-chief, but for the remainder of the year managed only a few military gains in Nova Scotia. His eldest son, William, had been killed while serving as Braddock's secretary, and his second son John had died of fever during the Niagara campaign.<br>
<br>In 1756, with limited support from Britain, Shirley laid plans for another campaign against the French but acted indecisively in carrying them out. Hence he lost Fort Oswego to the enemy. In July 1756 he was replaced as commander-in-chief by John Campbell, fourth earl of Loudoun, and ordered home to answer for his mismanagement of military affairs and for irregularities in his financial accounts. Officials in the war office wanted to court-martial Shirley, but lack of evidence forced the dropping of all charges in the autumn of 1757. Meantime he had been removed as governor of Massachusetts. In late 1758 he was promoted lieutenant-general and given the governorship of the Bahama Islands. Taking up residence in December 1759, he spent the next eight years working to suppress smuggling, improve education, and bolster the islands' defences. In 1767 he relinquished his office to his son, <a href="#cosubject_25437">Thomas [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and retired on the half pay of a colonel. Two years later he returned to his country estate, Shirley Place, in Roxbury, Massachusetts. There on 24 March 1771 he died. He was buried on 1 April in King's Chapel, Boston, beside the bodies of his first wife and daughter.<br>
<br>The third and only surviving son of William and Frances Shirley, <a name="cosubject_25437"></a><span class="headword">Sir Thomas Shirley</span>, first baronet  (1727&#150;1800), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was born in London in 1727 and accompanied his parents to Boston. He was enrolled in the Boston Latin school in 1737 but evinced little taste for classical learning. His father appointed him a captain in the British army in 1745. He was promoted major in 1759, and in 1767 succeeded his father as governor of the Bahama Islands. A year later he and his bride, Anna Maria Weston, took up residence there. He was appointed governor of Dominica in 1774. During the American War of Independence he and his family were prisoners of war for a time. In 1781 he was commissioned colonel of the 91st regiment and made governor of the Leeward Islands. He was created a baronet on 27 June 1786, and was promoted lieutenant-general in 1793 and general five years later. He died at Bath on 11 February 1800 and was succeeded in his title by his second son, William Warden Shirley.<br>
