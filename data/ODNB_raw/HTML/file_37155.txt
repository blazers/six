<span class="headword">Barnard,  John</span>  (1709&#150;1784), <span class="occ">collector of prints and drawings</span>, was born in London and was baptized on 25 August 1709 at St Laurence Pountney, the eldest of the three children and only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1456/', "Sir John Barnard")</script> of Greenwood (<i>c</i>.1685&#150;1764), MP for the City of London, and Jane (<i>d</i>. 1738), daughter of John Godschall, a London merchant trading with Turkey.<br>
<br>Barnard, who inherited a large fortune from his father, for fifty years devoted himself to the formation of a collection of prints, drawings, and paintings, becoming one of the foremost connoisseurs of his day. The earliest printed account of his collection dates from 1761: it lists sixty-five pictures and records that he also had a collection of &#145;about twelve thousand prints, engraved and etched by the most celebrated masters of the three last centuries &hellip; They are contained in about 50 large volumes, besides above 60 volumes in sculpture and architecture&#146;  (Dodsley and Dodsley, 292). His collection of prints included works of Italian, French, Flemish, German, and Dutch artists, and was distinguished by a nearly complete representation of the work of Marcantonio Raimondi, Wenceslaus Hollar, Rembrandt, Van Dyck, and Rubens.<br>
<br>Barnard's collection of drawings was also very fine and sheets with a provenance from his collection are usually of the highest calibre, both in quality and in the state of preservation. Several of his Rembrandt drawings were said to have a provenance from the Six collection in Amsterdam, and other purchases were made from distinguished contemporary sales such as those of the earl of Arundel, Sir Peter Lely, Lord Somers, Richard Mead, and Sir Uvedale Price. The sculptor Joseph Nollekens was reputed to have been removed from Barnard's will for not sufficiently admiring Barnard's Italian drawings.<br>
<br>Barnard established himself in Berkeley Square, London, with many prominent contemporaries as neighbours. His sister Sarah had married Alderman Sir Thomas Hankey; his younger sister, Jane, was the mother of the second Viscount Palmerston, a patron of Joseph Nollekens. His wife was previously the mistress of John Wilkes. Her infidelity continued after her marriage, which produced one daughter who died young. Barnard had originally bequeathed his prints, drawings, and books to John Wilkes. This bequest was revoked because of a cooling in the friendship, brought about by the continuing closeness between his wife and Wilkes.<br>
<br>Barnard died at Berkeley Square in 1784. His drawings were sold first by Greenwood, auctioneer of Leicester Square, on 16 February 1787 and seven days following. His prints were sold next by Harry Phillips, auctioneer of New Bond Street, on 16 April 1798 and twenty-five days following. He left his pictures to his nephew, Thomas Hankey of Bedford Square; these were sold at Christies on 7&#150;8 June 1799. His pictures are distinguished by having his monogram in black letters with an inventory number at the back.<br>
