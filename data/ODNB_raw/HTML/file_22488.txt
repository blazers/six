<span class="headword">Pond,  Arthur</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1701, <em>d.</em> 1758), <span class="occ">artist and printseller</span>, was baptized on 2 August 1701 in the parish church of St Magnus the Martyr, London. The oldest surviving son of John Pond (<i>d</i>. 1749), a wealthy surgeon of London Bridge, and his wife, Mary Marshall, he was the only member of his family to abandon trade for a riskier, potentially genteel profession. His artistic education may have begun under the portrait painter John Vanderbank, whose name appears near Pond's in the first subscription list of the St Martin's Lane Academy, founded in 1720. There Pond must have met William Hogarth and the painter George Knapton, probable source of a crucial introduction to Jonathan Richardson senior, portrait painter, author, and art theorist, whose books were published by John and Paul Knapton. Pond's subsequent career in the world of art, letters, and learning might be considered a realization of Richardson's visions of the learned artist, the gentlemanly connoisseur, and the revival of Italian artistic greatness in England. In 1725 Pond visited Italy in the company of the scholar Daniel Wray and John Dyer, painter and poet, and returned to England in 1727. The prestige of his Roman experience gave Pond access to important British art patrons, but his mediocrity as a painter anchored him in the lower tier of London practitioners, and his main successes occurred with pastel portraits in imitation of the Venetian artist Rosalba Carriera and the Swiss Jean-&Eacute;tienne Liotard.<br>
<br>Pond's greatest impact on English art and taste resulted from his printmaking and publishing in partnership with the Knapton booksellers, and as an art dealer. His single-minded promotion of the continental old masters, and of Italian art of all eras, earned him a comfortable fortune, prestige, and the enmity of both George Vertue and William Hogarth, insular champions of English art. In partnership with the landscape etcher Charles Knapton, Pond etched and published <span class="italic">Prints in Imitation of Drawings</span> (1735&#150;6), depicting Dutch and Italian old master drawings in British collections, and <span class="italic">Caricatures</span> (1736&#150;42), popularizing the drawings of the Roman artist Pier Leone Ghezzi. However, it was Pond's <span class="italic">Italian Landscapes</span> (1741&#150;8), commercially produced engravings after paintings by Claude Lorrain and Gaspard Poussin, and his <span class="italic">Roman Antiquities</span> (1745&#150;51), engraved views of ruins after Roman artist Gian Paolo Pannini, that established widespread British appreciation of Italian classical landscape.<br>
<br>Thanks to his Roman contacts, Pond maintained a steady and lucrative trade in old master art and copies. Ironically, he is admired today as an ambitious collector of Rembrandt prints and paintings, acquired in Amsterdam while on business for the Knaptons, or from the dispersal of British collections. In the late 1740s Pond's collecting extended to exotic shells, perhaps stemming from his involvement in the Knaptons' publication of <span class="italic">Anson's Voyages</span> in 1748. In 1752 Pond was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and of the Society of Antiquaries, the only artist of his generation to receive both honours. Although records of the last seven years of his life are thin, he planned to withdraw from the messy business of painting in 1757. Ongoing publication of the prints had already been entrusted to his mistress, Elizabeth Knapton, widow of his former partner Charles, who had died in 1743. Contemporaries attributed Pond's failure to marry to his social ambitions. He died of a fever in September 1758 at his house in Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, and was buried in his sister and brother-in-law's parish of Sanderstead, outside London.<br>
