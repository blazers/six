<span class="headword">Dyer,  Alfred  Stace</span>  (1849&#150;1926), <span class="occ">moral reformer</span>, was born Alfred Dyer at Kingsthorpe, Northampton, on 14 August 1849, the son of John Dyer, gardener, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones. His mother was widowed early in his childhood, and he left school at twelve to begin work in a printing firm. Brought up a Congregationalist, he became a committed evangelical Quaker in his early twenties. By 1871 he was employed as a lecturer for a peace organization, the International Arbitration Society, of which he became secretary. On 28 May 1872 he married Helen, the 21-year-old daughter of Robert Stace, printer, with whom he had a daughter. He incorporated his wife's surname in his own name. During the late 1870s he supported his family by writing a sequence of <span class="roman">Penny Popular Biographies</span> of prominent evangelicals, including Charles Spurgeon.<br>
<br>Dyer attended one of Josephine Butler's public speeches for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span> (which enforced the periodic gynaecological inspection of women deemed &#145;known prostitutes&#146; in garrison towns) and responded in 1877 to Butler's public call for working-class men to help her campaign against state-regulated prostitution. As well as joining her Working Men's National League for the Abolition of the State Regulation of Vice, he founded in 1879 a new monthly journal, <span class="italic">The Sentinel: the Organ of the Social Purity Movement</span>. He went on to play a part in changing the direction of Butler's moral crusade, by exposing the evils of the state-regulated brothels in mainland Europe. A fellow Quaker told him that an acquaintance had found an English girl in a state-licensed brothel in Brussels who claimed to be held against her will. After consulting Butler, Dyer travelled to Brussels where, with the help of the Belgian reformer Pastor Leonard Anet, he rescued three young British women who had been lured to Brussels under false promises of marriage, and forced to work as prostitutes. Butler recognized the propaganda value of their shocking individual narratives, but few newspapers would print Dyer's findings. In response, he set up a purity publishing firm, Dyer Brothers, with his brother George, at Amen Corner, Paternoster Row, London.<br>
<br>Early in 1880 Dyer published <span class="italic">The European Slave Trade in English Girls: a Narrative of Facts</span>, detailing the stories of all three women and alleging Brussels police collusion and British diplomatic inertia. He described how &#145;the wealthy Continental debauchee, reared under the influence of the moral blight of licensed debauchery&#146;, was willing to pay &#145;an amount equal to a poor man's annual income for the opportunity of violating a betrayed, terrified, and helpless virgin&#146;  (pp. 5&#150;6). The pamphlet was an overnight sensation, running to six editions in as many months. In its wake, the London Committee for the Suppression of the Foreign Traffic in British Girls for Purposes of Continental Prostitution, founded by Dyer, lobbied a reluctant home secretary, Sir William Harcourt, to send an official investigation to Brussels. Thomas Snagge, a London barrister sent by Harcourt, found enough evidence of the systematic entrapment of British women to precipitate, in May 1881, an inquiry by a House of Lords select committee. Dyer gave evidence (26 July 1881) on his own rescue activities in Brussels. Although the committee found that many of the thirty-three women whom Snagge discovered had worked as prostitutes before leaving England, it none the less recommended that the taking of women abroad for the purposes of prostitution be made a criminal offence.<br>
<br>The success of <span class="italic">The European Slave Trade in English Girls</span> encouraged Dyer's mission to reform public morals through a publishing crusade. In 1883 he joined Ellice Hopkins's White Cross League, an organization dedicated to persuading men and boys to resist sexual temptation. A series of public lectures across the United Kingdom was soon published as <span class="italic">Facts for Men on Moral Purity and Health</span> (1884), <span class="italic">Safeguards Against Immorality</span> (1885), and the best-selling <span class="italic">Plain Words to Young Men on an Avoided Subject</span> (1885), which reached sales of 150,000 in the 1890s. The &#145;avoided subject&#146; was masturbation: Dyer gave pungent warnings that &#145;the habits you indulge in today will fasten themselves upon you with a firmer grip as the years go on&#146;  (<span class="italic">Plain Words</span>, 11) and recommended an ascetic regime of cold baths, fresh air, simple food, teetotalism, exercise, and prayer. By 1885 15,000 men had taken the White Cross League's purity pledge, binding them to abstain from &#145;impure thoughts&#146;, pornography, masturbation, and premarital sex.<br>
<br>Dyer was vigorous in affiliated attempts to curtail male sexual licence. In 1884 he became involved in a White Cross League &#145;moral moonlighting&#146; campaign in Glasgow, which involved the attempted intimidation of would-be clients by picketing brothels: he later exported the tactic to Bombay and Peking, where he once more became the victim of assaults. In May 1885 Dyer's London committee initiated the prosecution of Mary Jeffries, the madam of a string of Chelsea brothels catering for wealthy or aristocratic clients. When the committee was prevented from giving its evidence by her unexpected guilty plea, her &pound;200 fine being paid by an anonymous friend, Dyer's outrage took on predictable connotations: &#145;The inferences from the evidence point to a state of moral corruption, heartless cruelty and prostitution of authority almost sufficient to goad the industrial classes into revolution&#146; (<span class="italic">The Sentinel</span>, quoted in Bristow, 107).<br>
<br>Dyer's campaigns helped to animate W. T. Stead's expos&eacute; of &#145;moral corruption&#146; in July 1885, through the &#145;Maiden tribute of modern Babylon&#146; articles published in the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, which in turn precipitated the <span class="roman">Criminal Law Amendment Act</span>, raising the age of consent for girls to sixteen. Together with William Coote, an old ally from the Working Men's League, Dyer helped Stead to set up the National Vigilance Association, dedicated to the enforcement of the new act. On 22 August Dyer spoke at the Hyde Park rally for &#145;social purity&#146; in legislation and public life. In November he stood as a parliamentary candidate in Derby against Sir William Harcourt, whom he denounced as &#145;a great block in the way of purity of legislation&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 November 1885, 7). Harcourt retained his seat; Dyer gained only 1231 votes, and was stoned and beaten during the campaign.<br>
<br>In 1886 Dyer's attention shifted from Britain to India, where versions of the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span> were still in force, and the <span class="roman">Criminal Law Amendment Act</span> did not apply. His <span class="italic">Slavery under the British Flag: the Iniquities of British rule in India and in our crown colonies and dependencies, to the friends of social purity</span> appeared in 1887, the year he emigrated with his wife to Bombay, where their only child Heria was born. Dyer took over the editorship of the evangelical <span class="italic">Bombay Guardian</span>, later the <span class="italic">Indian Church Quarterly Review</span>. His campaign against British colonialists' sexual exploitation of Indian women publicized the state-regulated brothels provided for British armed forces stationed in India, and exposed the complicity of the authorities in sanctioning and even encouraging those facilities. His exposures were accumulated in the polemical <span class="italic">British Soldiers in India in Regard to their Morals and Health</span> (1897). While instigating a Bombay midnight mission, he became increasingly preoccupied by the connections between prostitution and drug addiction, travelling between Bombay and Peking to expose incidents of the international trafficking of women and publishing tracts entitled <span class="italic">Chinese Christians and the Ravages of the Opium Plague</span> (1890), <span class="italic">The Great Plague of Asia</span> (1891), and <span class="italic">Britain's Crimes in China: a Short History of the Opium Traffic</span> (1892), simultaneously published in Bombay and through Dyer Brothers in London.<br>
<br>By the turn of the century Dyer's influence was on the wane. Although he continued to give lectures to the Bombay Young Men's Christian Association on sexual continence (published as <span class="italic">The Knight of the White Cross</span> in 1899), his evangelizing approach to matters of sexuality was being gradually displaced by a more &#145;scientific&#146; programme of &#145;social hygiene&#146;. In 1900 he returned to England, settling with his wife and daughter in Aldington, Kent. A religious study of China appeared in 1905. In 1911 he broke away from the Quakers, rejecting their understanding of the role of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in Christian faith. <span class="italic">The Book Triumphant and Infallible</span> (1919) was his fundamentalist retort, followed shortly by the still more polemical <span class="italic">A Prodigal Sect (the Society of Friends)</span> (1919). He died at Mount Pleasant, Aldington, Kent, on 20 October 1926.<br>
