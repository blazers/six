<span class="headword">Crouch,  Frederick Nicholls</span>  (1808&#150;1896), <span class="occ">cellist and composer</span>, was born on 31 July 1808 at Warren Street, Fitzroy Square, London, the son of Frederick William Crouch (<i>c</i>.1783&#150;1844), cellist and author of <span class="italic">A Complete Treatise on the Violoncello</span> (1826), and his wife, Anna Maria, daughter of John Nicholls, barrister. His paternal grandfather, the composer William Crouch, was organist of St Luke's, Old Street. He played at the Royal Coburg Theatre from the age of nine, and later at the King's Theatre, Drury Lane, and elsewhere, as a member of Queen Adelaide's private band among others. He travelled in Yorkshire and Scotland, and for two years was obliged to work on coastal smacks plying between London and Leith. After tuition from William Hawes he sang in the choirs of Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral. From about 1822 he studied at the Royal Academy of Music with Crotch, Attwood, Crivelli, and Linley, among others, and played in London orchestras including the Philharmonic and those of the Antient Concerts and Royal Italian Opera. Some time after 1832 he moved to Plymouth, where he worked as a singer and as a travelling salesman for a firm of metal brokers, and invented the engraving process known as zincography. He was also musical supervisor to the London publishers D'Almaine &amp; Co. From about 1838 he gave lecture recitals on the songs and legends of Ireland, at the same time publishing <span class="italic">The Songs and Legends of Ireland</span>, which included his most successful song, &#145;Kathleen Mavourneen&#146;.<br>
<br>By 1849 Crouch was in America, where he played in the Astor Place Opera House, and where his (mostly unsuccessful) musical enterprises included conducting, singing, and teaching in Boston, Portland, Philadelphia (conducting Mrs Rush's Saturday Concerts), Washington, and Richmond. He joined the Confederate army in the Civil War as a trumpeter, then taught singing in Baltimore, and, from 1883, worked as a varnisher in a factory. He also wrote two operas, <span class="italic">Sir Roger de Coverley</span> and <span class="italic">The Fifth of November, 1670</span>, an <span class="italic">Othello Travestie</span>, a monody, song collections including <span class="italic">Songs of Erin</span>, <span class="italic">Echoes of the Past</span>, <span class="italic">Bardic Reminiscences</span>, <span class="italic">Songs of the Olden Time</span>, <span class="italic">Songs of a Rambler</span>, and <span class="italic">Wayside Melodies</span>, and many other songs popular in their day. A testimonial concert was given for him in Baltimore in 1883. An autobiographical memoir was published in the Boston <span class="italic">Folio</span> in January 1887. Crouch married Lydia Pearson, whom he deserted in 1845; he fathered sixteen children, including Emma Elizabeth (1835?&#150;1886), the Parisian Second Empire courtesan known as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21697/', "Cora Pearl")</script>. He died in Portland, Maine, on 18 August 1896.<br>
