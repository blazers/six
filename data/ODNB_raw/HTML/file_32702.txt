<span class="headword">Dalziel,  (James) Henry</span>, Baron Dalziel of Kirkcaldy  (1868&#150;1935), <span class="occ">politician and newspaper proprietor</span>, was born at Borgue, Kirkcudbrightshire, on 24 April 1868, the second son of James Dalziel (<i>d</i>. 1904), shoemaker, of Borgue, and his wife, Margaret Emily Davies. He was educated at Borgue Academy, at Shrewsbury high school, and at King's College, London. He began work as a journalist, and through his employment in the parliamentary press gallery he became known to the Liberal Party whips. Having obtained a financial interest in the old radical paper <span class="italic">Reynolds's News</span> he was encouraged by Edward Marjoribanks, the chief whip, to stand as a Liberal candidate at the March 1892 by-election in Kirkcaldy, in the hope that he could later &#145;use his knowledge of the press world in the foundation of a Liberal newspaper&#146;  (Gilbert, 159). He won the seat by a large majority and retained it until he entered the House of Lords in 1921.<br>
<br>One of Dalziel's earliest acts in parliament was to introduce a motion (3 April 1894) supporting Scottish home rule to provide a legislature in Scotland for Scottish affairs; this was followed soon afterwards by a resolution calling for the same for each of Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. This brought Dalziel into alliance with the Welsh nationalists and with David Lloyd George, who spoke for the motion. Dalziel remained close to, and an important and loyal supporter of, Lloyd George throughout the rest of his career.<br>
<br>Not particularly successful as a parliamentary performer Dalziel was of most use to the future prime minister as part of his political manipulation of the press. In 1909 he first brought Lloyd George together with the powerful press proprietor Lord Northcliffe. In 1914 Dalziel became sole owner of <span class="italic">Reynolds's News</span>, and during the Liberal split of late 1916 his paper became a mouthpiece, with support from other areas of the press, for Lloyd George in his successful campaign for leadership of a coalition government. In 1918 Dalziel organized Lloyd George's purchase of the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>. Dalziel, who had been knighted in 1908 and sworn of the privy council in 1912, was rewarded with a baronetcy on 25 June 1918 and was made chairman and political director of the paper. Sir George Riddell noted that Lloyd George would have full editorial control of the paper through Dalziel, &#145;who will in effect be his agent&#146;  (Koss, 335). Dalziel had also been increasing his own holdings, including the purchase of the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> in 1917. But he was not a success in his political role at the paper and was replaced in 1921, the year in which, on 28 June, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Dalziel of Kirkcaldy. In December 1922 he sold all his newspaper interests and effectively retired from business and politics, though he was subsequently recruited as a member of the National Party of Scotland.<br>
<br>On 12 July 1928, at the age of sixty, Dalziel married Amy, daughter of Fossey Thackery and widow of Donald Macrae of Wicklow. Her sudden death on 26 June 1935 greatly affected him, and he died of heart failure at his home, 1 Brunswick Terrace, Hove, Sussex, nineteen days later, on 15 July. He was buried at Borgue on 22 July.<br>
