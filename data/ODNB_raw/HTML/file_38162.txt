<span class="headword">Yockney,  Samuel Hansard</span>  (1813&#150;1893), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born in St Martin's Lane, London, on 12 October 1813, the eldest son in the family of three sons and two daughters of Samuel Foyster Yockney, West India merchant, and his wife, Laetitia, daughter of Luke Hansard. He was educated at Mill Hill School under Dr Thorowgood and was not intended for any profession until family losses made it necessary. At the age of twenty-four he began an apprenticeship with Stothert &amp; Co. of Bath, civil engineering contractors.<br>
<br>Soon afterwards, in 1838, Yockney was appointed engineer and manager on the construction of the Box Tunnel on the Great Western Railway (GWR). He acquitted himself so well that he attracted the favourable notice of Isambard K. Brunel, so that on the completion of the tunnel he joined the engineering staff of the GWR. He was first put in charge of the tunnels and other works between Bristol and Bath, as well as being responsible for the manufacture of coke at the company's Bristol works, where he initiated several important improvements. He married in 1840 Frances Emily (1818/19&#150;1889), daughter of Captain Edward Holmes RN.<br>
<br>Yockney moved in 1846 to south Wales, where he was involved in the construction of the Newport Tunnel and the Usk and Chepstow viaducts, on the railway line from Newport to Chepstow. On the completion of this he was placed in charge in 1851&#150;2 of the heavy engineering works on the Oxford and Wolverhampton line, including high timber viaducts and the Dudley Tunnel. In late 1853 he moved to Paris, where he was engaged on bridges and embankments of the Seine, and on railways in and around the city. He then surveyed for a French company a number of railway lines in Italy and Switzerland before returning to England, where he worked on the Birmingham, Wolverhampton, and Dudley Railway and the Kennet and Avon and Stourbridge canals.<br>
<br>In 1858&#150;9 Yockney was in the service of the Admiralty, before returning to south Wales, where for ten years he was engineer-in-chief and general manager of the Sirhowy tramroad, which he converted into a standard railway. During this time he introduced cast-iron brake blocks of the type which later came into general use. In 1868 he moved back to London, where he set up in practice at 46 Queen Anne's Gate as a consulting civil engineer, in association with his son Sydney William Yockney. Together they designed and supervised a large number of contracts, including the Wye Valley Railway, the Guernsey tramway, the Cardiff and Penarth tramway, the East Worcestershire waterworks, and Totland Bay pier, as well as acting as engineers to the West Bromwich sanitary commissioners. Yockney became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1860, and was also a fellow of the Geological Society (1865). He died of diabetes at his son's home, Wye Cottage, Tidenham, Gloucestershire, on 29 December 1893 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
