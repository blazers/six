<span class="headword">Hinchliff,  Thomas Woodbine</span>  (1825&#150;1882), <span class="occ">mountaineer and writer</span>, was born on 5 December 1825 at 25 Park Street, Southwark, London, the eldest son of Chamberlain Hinchliff of Lee, Kent, and his wife, Sarah Parish, sister of Sir Woodbine Parish. The spelling of the family name changed from Hinchliffe to Hinchliff between 1849 and 1852. After attending the grammar school at West Ham and then the Blackheath proprietary school, he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1849, and MA in 1852. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1849 and was called to the bar in 1852, but did not practise.<br>
<br>Hinchliff did much to bring mountain climbing into vogue. He was an active mountaineer in the 1850s and a prominent figure in the Alpine Club, which he helped to found in 1857. That year, after numerous alpine ascents over the preceding three summers, he published <span class="italic">Summer Months among the Alps</span>, a work that was well regarded by other mountaineers. From 1858 to 1860 he climbed in the Alps with Leslie Stephen, who remembered him for his good humour, boyish enthusiasm, and lack of ambition: &#145;He was not tormented by the feverish ambition of us youngsters, who were for winning glory as well as pleasure&#146;  (<span class="italic">Alpine Journal</span>, 41&#150;3). Early meetings of the Alpine Club were held in Hinchliff's rooms at Lincoln's Inn, and he served as the club's first honorary secretary, and its president from 1874 to 1877.<br>
<br>In 1862, when he lost part of his right hand in a gun accident, Hinchliff stopped climbing. He nevertheless continued to travel in the Alps and outside Europe. In 1861 he toured Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil, a journey later described in <span class="italic">South American Sketches</span> (1863), and in 1871 he returned to South America. In 1873&#150;4 he went around the world, a trip he later described in <span class="italic">Over the Sea and Far Away</span> (1876). He was also an amateur botanist, and wrote articles (1876&#150;81) on the Italian lakes and Lake Geneva for <span class="italic">Picturesque Europe</span>. While on his way to the Italian lakes, Hinchliff was taken ill. He died a few hours later, on 8 May 1882, at Aix-les-Bains, France, where he was buried. He never married. A memorial obelisk was erected by his friends on the flanks of the Gorner Grat, near the Riffelalp Hotel.<br>
