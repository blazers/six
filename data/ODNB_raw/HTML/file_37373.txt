<span class="headword">Drummond,  Peter</span>  (1850&#150;1918), <span class="occ">locomotive engineer</span>, was born on 13 August 1850 in Polmont, Stirlingshire, the son of George Drummond, who was then a permanent-way inspector on that section of the Edinburgh and Glasgow (later North British) Railway, and his wife, Christina Thomson. When Peter was young the family moved to Maryhill, Glasgow, where he served an apprenticeship with Forrest and Barr, general engineers and millwrights, with whom his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37372/', "Dugald Drummond")</script>, ten years his senior and a much more forceful character, had also been apprenticed. In 1871, after serving his time, Drummond moved to the locomotive works of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway in Brighton where Dugald was already working under William Stroudley. On 29 August 1876 Drummond married Mary McLay Phillips, a dressmaker, the daughter of John Phillips, a Maryhill joiner. They had at least one daughter. When Dugald returned to Glasgow in 1875 to become the locomotive superintendent of the North British Railway, Peter too came north, securing a position at that railway's Cowlairs works. In 1882 when Dugald &#145;crossed the tracks&#146; to become the locomotive superintendent of the rival Caledonian Railway he took Peter with him, Peter being appointed assistant locomotive engineer&#151;a post reputed to have been created especially for him. Whether originally appointed on merit or not, Drummond possessed good organizational skills and is credited with reorganizing St Rollox works into a far more efficient unit. In 1890 the two brothers' paths diverged: Dugald left to set up a private concern while Peter stayed at St Rollox, supervising the production of many famous Caledonian locomotive classes and being appointed works manager in 1895.<br>
<br>In 1897 Drummond moved to Inverness to become the locomotive, carriage, and wagon superintendent of the Highland Railway. As an astute engineer who was never afraid to copy, he built a 4&#150;6&#150;0 express passenger locomotive that his predecessor, David Jones, had on the drawing board when he was appointed, merely replacing the Jones style chimney and cab with designs similar to contemporary practice on the Caledonian. These engines proved so successful that fifty similar machines were purchased by the French Chemins de Fer de l'Est. He reorganized the locomotive works at Lochgorm along modern lines and designed a variety of successful snowploughs. When he turned his attentions to new locomotive designs he looked more to the Caledonian and to his elder brother's design than to any previous Highland tradition for inspiration&#151;indeed throughout his design career he was highly influenced by Dugald, borrowing many features both good and bad and producing engines which possessed a &#145;family likeness&#146;. He perhaps only became his own man in terms of design after Dugald's death in 1912. Among the bad features borrowed were firebox cross water tubes and steam reversing, both of which were disliked by crews; otherwise his locomotives were simple and robust. In 1906 his status was elevated to chief mechanical engineer.<br>
<br>Drummond moved to Kilmarnock in 1912 to become the locomotive, carriage, and wagon superintendent of the Glasgow and South Western Railway at a salary of &pound;1100 per annum. Overbearing, and in open contempt of his predecessor, James Manson, he made sweeping changes to established practice, including the imposition of the &#145;Drummond Standard&#146; left-hand drive, and built a series of huge engines&#151;his first three designs were the heaviest of their wheel arrangement in the UK at the time. Unfortunately these engines, encumbered with typical Drummond gadgetry of feed pumps and steam driers, were not very successful and were disliked by the crews and maintenance staff alike. After about three years at Kilmarnock an unexplained and total change took place in him. Previously rough and overbearing, not unlike his brother, he became a quiet man, fair in dealing with his men and building engines which were sound in design and even brilliant in performance.<br>
<br>Drummond was elected a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1898. He took a keen interest in the education of his men and in their improvement societies. On 30 March 1918 he became ill and died of cancer on 30 June 1918 at Belmont, Grange Terrace, Kilmarnock, aged sixty-seven.<br>
