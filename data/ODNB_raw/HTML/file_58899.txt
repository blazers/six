</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Turpin,  Randolph Adolphus</span>  (1928&#150;1966), <span class="occ">boxer</span>, was born on 7 June 1928 at his parents' home, 6 Willes Road, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, the youngest of five children (three boys and two girls) of Lionel Fitzherbert Turpin, an iron-moulder at a gas stove works, and his wife, Beatrice Elizabeth Whitehouse. Lionel Turpin was a native of British Guiana who moved to Britain during the First World War, joined the infantry, and was gassed on the Somme; he eventually died from his injuries in 1929. Beatrice Turpin, a white Englishwoman, supported the family by working at a succession of low-paid jobs to eke out a meagre pension. In 1931 she married Ernest Manley, and the family settled in Warwick, where Randolph attended the West Gate council school.<br>
<br>Growing up in the face of racial prejudice, the Turpin boys learned to use their fists in self-defence. Randolph's elder brothers Dick and Jackie became &#145;booth fighters&#146;, putting on exhibition bouts at fairs and carnivals for a fistful of pennies tossed into the ring by spectators. Dick turned professional in 1937 and eventually (28 June 1948) became British middleweight champion, the first boxer of colour to hold a British professional title. Jackie became a ranked fighter in the featherweight division. Randolph's career began in 1942, when he joined the boxing section of the Leamington boys' club, started by a local policeman as a means of keeping youngsters out of trouble. He made his amateur d&eacute;but in March 1942, and subsequently fought more than 100 bouts, gaining national junior titles in 1943 and 1945. In 1945 he gained the Amateur Boxing Association welterweight championship. He meanwhile worked as a builder's labourer before volunteering in December 1945 for the Royal Navy, where he served as a cook at the Portsmouth naval base. In June 1946 he was a member of a British team that boxed against a United States squad selected by the Amateur Athletic Union. Shortly afterwards, in September 1946, he turned professional under the management of George Middleton. He married, on 25 January 1947, at St Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Leamington Spa, Mary Theresa (<i>b</i>. 1927/8), daughter of Matthew Paul Stack, a laboratory worker, and sister of Michael Stack, also a boxer. Their son was born later that year, but they separated in 1948.<br>
<br>Turpin left the navy in March 1948, and won all eight of his professional fights in the following year. Training at the Nelson gym, above a gelatine factory in Warwick, he used a regime of weight training to develop his body strength which, together with his long reach, made him a formidable fighter. On 17 October 1950 he won the British middleweight championship with a five-round victory over Croydon truck driver Albert Finch. His career really took off, however, when he sensationally knocked out Dutchman Luc van Dam in only 48 seconds at the Harringay arena on 27 February 1951, to take the European middleweight championship. By then his brawling, swinging, and slashing fighting style had earned him the publicity tag of the Leamington Licker. Subsequent victories inside the distance saw him matched with champion Sugar Ray Robinson for the world title at Earls Court, London, on 10 July 1951. The American, the four-to-one favourite, and only once defeated in 133 fights, was drained by a hectic European tour, and went down to a fifteen-round points defeat, in front of 18,000 wildly cheering British fans. As the first British fighter to hold the world middleweight title since Bob Fitzsimmons in 1891, Turpin became a national hero.<br>
<br>Turpin's reign lasted for only sixty-four days. In the rematch before 61,370 spectators at New York polo grounds on 12 September 1951, when Robinson was back to his best condition and sharpness, Turpin lost on a technical knock-out in the tenth round. He went on to fight in the heavier division, stopping Don Cockell in the eleventh round on 10 June 1952 to win the British and empire light heavyweight titles. On 21 October 1953 he challenged Carl (Bobo) Olson at Madison Square Gardens for the vacant world middleweight crown. Turpin's defeat on a unanimous points decision after a controversially casual preparation&#151;disregarding advice, he had organized his own training&#151;marked the beginning of the decline in his fighting career. His first marriage had, meanwhile, been dissolved in June 1953 and on 15 November 1953 he married Gwyneth Price (<i>b</i>. 1925/6), who had watched his workouts at Gwrych Castle, Denbighshire. She was the daughter of Robert Owen Price, a Welsh hill farmer. They had four daughters.<br>
<br>Although his reflexes were becoming slower, Turpin continued to fight at the highest level until his knock-out by the Trinidadian Yolande Pompey at Birmingham on 9 September 1958. In the following month he announced his retirement. He worked as a car-breaker in a Leamington scrap metal yard and from 1959 helped to run his wife's transport caf&eacute;. In 1961 British boxing officials refused to let him be a sparring partner for Terry Downes, then the British middleweight champion, because of the cumulative impact of ring beatings on his mental and physical state. By then most of his fight earnings, rumoured to have been &pound;100,000, had gone, frittered away on high living (he acquired fast cars and was a sharp dresser), failed business ventures, and, perhaps most of all, the hangers-on who exploited his generous nature. &#145;I was fleeced right, left and centre by those around me&#146;, he complained  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 18 May 1966). Incidents involving women also punctuated his career: an assault charge brought by his first wife was dismissed in March 1948; an allegation of rape in 1953 was settled out of court in New York two years later; and he was cited in a divorce petition  (Birtley, 99&#150;105). In 1962 he was declared bankrupt with tax debts of &pound;17,000. He took to circus wrestling to raise funds, but these earnings in turn led to further tax demands.<br>
<br>Turpin died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the heart at Gwen's Transport Caf&eacute;, 9&#150;11 Russell Street, Leamington Spa, on 17 May 1966. His wife survived him. Conducting his funeral service, Eugene Haselden observed that &#145;At the height of his career Randolph was surrounded by those who regarded themselves as friends and well-wishers. But he was deserted by many as he lost his position and money&#146;  (Birtley, 145). American magazines such as <span class="italic">Newsweek</span> and <span class="italic">Time</span> dismissed the British boxer as a shell of a man who had wound up as a cook at his wife's caf&eacute;. The <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> (28 May 1966), however, recognized Turpin as &#145;the most exciting fighter raised in Britain for a generation&#146;. A bronze statue of him was unveiled in Warwick in 2001 bearing an inscription which recalled his historic victory over Robinson: &#145;In palace, pub and parlour, the whole of Britain held its breath&#146;.<br>
