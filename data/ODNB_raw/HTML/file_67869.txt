<span class="headword">Fagg,  Bernard Evelyn Buller</span>  (1915&#150;1987), <span class="occ">archaeologist and museum curator</span>, was born on 8 December 1915 in Upper Norwood, London, the son of William Percy Fagg, antiquarian bookseller, and his wife, Lilian (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Buller). His brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51030/', "William Buller Fagg")</script>. He went to school at Woodford and at Dulwich College, and then entered Downing College, Cambridge, where he read classics in part one of the tripos and archaeology and anthropology in part two (in those days archaeology and anthropology could be read only in part two). He became one of that band of Cambridge undergraduates who &#145;took archaeology to Africa&#146;.<br>
<br>After taking his degree at Cambridge, Fagg was accepted as a cadet for the colonial administrative service and did his colonial service training course at Oxford. In July 1939 he was posted to the provincial administration of Plateau province in Nigeria, stationed at Jos. On the outbreak of war he enlisted in the 1st field company of the west African engineers, and served in east Africa. He used his army leave there to work with Louis and Mary Leakey. Through them he met Mary Catherine Davidson (<i>b</i>. 1915), a teacher, whom he married in 1942. He was recalled in 1943 to Nigeria, where he was assigned to an administrative department in Jos formed to promote the production of tin, which the allies urgently needed following the occupation of the Malayan tin sources by the Japanese.<br>
<br>At Jos, Fagg devoted all his spare time to field research into the prehistoric remains of the area in the form of finds and field monuments, and in this was ably assisted by his wife, who had been trained by working with Mary Leakey in east Africa. His first preliminary excavation was at the Ropp rock shelter, where he discovered a late Stone Age occupation containing microliths.<br>
<br>It was fortunate that Fagg's job kept him closely in touch with tin production, because it was from the diggings for this mineral that a remarkable series of terracotta figurines was being unearthed. As soon as one of these terracotta figurines came to Fagg's notice in 1943, he recognized its importance and uniqueness, and its similarity to one found in 1928 near the village of Nok. Following the archaeological practice of the time, Fagg assigned the name of this first find place to the culture which had produced the figurines. In subsequent years many more figurines in the same style came to light and Fagg was responsible for their preservation. He subsequently wrote more than a dozen articles about them in scientific and art journals, and in 1977 a beautifully illustrated book, <span class="italic">Nok Terracottas</span>, was published by Ethnographica and the National Museum, Lagos, which enabled the public to appreciate their beauty and significance. Fagg succeeded in dating the Nok figurines to the last centuries <span class="smallcap">BC</span>, which greatly added to their interest. He also discovered and excavated the site of Taruga, where figurine material was associated with iron smelting furnaces. These were dated to the last half of the first millennium <span class="smallcap">BC</span> and were at the time the earliest such known from sub-Saharan Africa.<br>
<br>Soon after the end of the Second World War, Kenneth Murray had persuaded the Nigerian government of the importance of preserving the country's rich heritage of material culture, and he was appointed to the newly created post of surveyor of antiquities. In 1947 Fagg was appointed his number two as assistant surveyor of antiquities. When Murray retired in 1957 Fagg was appointed director of the new department of antiquities, covering the whole of Nigeria. He appreciated the urgent need to house the growing collections of traditional material culture and prehistoric remains, and to provide facilities for their study, conservation, and display. He himself designed, and built with direct labour, the Jos Museum, opened in 1952, only the second public museum in British West Africa. It was soon to be followed by the establishment of the Ife Museum (1954), the Nigerian Museum in Lagos, the Oron Museum, the Gidan Makama Museum in Kano, and the Museum Gallery in Kaduna in 1959. Fagg realized the need for trained staff for museums throughout tropical Africa, and in collaboration with UNESCO and with the support of the federal government of Nigeria he established at Jos a bilingual (English-French) training centre for museum technicians. In 1961 he was elected president of the Museums Association of Tropical Africa, and in 1962 he was made an MBE.<br>
<br>In 1963 Fagg was appointed curator of the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford. The university recognized that the museum, although having unique collections, was seriously overcrowded and suffered the constraints of the provisions of its founder. Fagg was chosen to overcome these difficulties and to create a worthy modern museum. He came up with a clever design to reconcile Pitt Rivers's testamentary request for the continuation of his typological principles with the advantages of geographical arrangement. This innovative idea was given effect in Pier Luigi Nervi's design for a new museum to be located on a site on the Banbury Road. Unfortunately the university lacked the necessary money. During this period Fagg spent most of his energies trying to reconcile the dissensions the plan had aroused and to raise the necessary funds, but no wealthy benefactor was found to solve the financial problem within the time limit set by the university. The strain told on Fagg and in May 1968 he suffered a severe stroke which confined him thereafter to a wheelchair. So, sadly, Nervi's plans became a historical relic of a noble plan that failed. Bernard Fagg retired in 1975; he died at his home, 45 Woodstock Road, Oxford, on 14 August 1987 and was cremated at Oxford crematorium. He was survived by his wife.<br>
