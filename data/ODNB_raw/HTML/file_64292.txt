<span class="headword">Ward,  Caesar</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1710, <em>d.</em> 1759), <span class="occ">bookseller and historian</span>, was baptized on 2 June 1710 in the parish of St Sepulchre, Holborn, London, the son of Caesar Ward (1675&#150;1712), apothecary, and his wife, Ann. He married first Mary Kilsha (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1715) of Clothall, Hertfordshire, on 29 February 1736, but she evidently died within the year. His second marriage, in or before 1738, was to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56213/', "Ann Ward (1715/16&#150;1789)")</script>, about whose early life little is known.<br>
<br>Ward was apprenticed in 1725 to Robert Gosling, bookseller and father of the bookseller&#150;banker Sir Francis Gosling. About the time of his freedom of the Stationers' Company in September 1732, Ward set up business at the sign of the Ship between the Temple Gates, Fleet Street, in a shop formerly occupied by the bookseller James Lacy. His brother-in-law and partner Richard Chandler joined him soon after this, and by 1734 the partnership had a second shop in Scarborough, at the corner of Long Room Street.<br>
<br>Ward was admitted to the freedom of the city of York by purchase in 1736, and by 1737 he and Chandler had added a third shop to their business, one formerly occupied by Mr Mancklin in Coney Street, York. At about the same time they moved their London shop to the Strand, at the Ship without Temple Bar. Parish accounts suggest that Richard Chandler was the main tenant at this address until 1742, when he was replaced by the bookseller William Sandby, probably elder brother to Edward Sandby, apprenticed to Ward in York in 1744. William Sandby acted as Ward's London agent until Ward's death.<br>
<br>The partnership seemed to prosper in this unusually enterprising arrangement. Ward and Chandler maintained valuable connections with the London trade, regularly buying and selling books and copies (that is, shares) in books at numerous London trade sales in the 1730s and early 1740s. They published a wide range of books, including <span class="italic">Popery Confuted by Papists</span> (1736), Thomas Cox's <span class="italic">Magna Britannica</span> (1738), Defoe's <span class="italic">Colonel Jack</span> (1739), and Cervantes' <span class="italic">Persiles and Sigismunda</span> (1741). The proximity of their London shops to the inns of court and Chancery Lane probably lay behind the preponderance of law books in their list, including the <span class="italic">Attorney's Compleat Pocket-Book</span> and the <span class="italic">Law for and Against Bankrupts</span> (both 1743). The wording of the imprint of one of their books&#151;James Anderson's <span class="italic">New Book of Constitutions of the Antient and Honourable Fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons</span>, &#145;printed for Brothers C&aelig;sar Ward and Richard Chandler&#146; (1738)&#151;suggests that both were freemasons. In January 1739 the partners took over the proprietorship of the <span class="italic">York Courant</span> (established in 1725) from Alexander Staples, as well as his printing house in the former Bagnio, Coney Street.<br>
<br>The downfall of the partnership lay in Richard Chandler's over-investment in the multi-volume <span class="italic">History and Proceedings of the House of Commons from the Restoration to the Present Time</span> (1742&#150;4). While the venture initially seemed successful&#151;Frederick, prince of Wales, gave the <span class="italic">History</span> some encouragement&#151;the financial burden evidently became too much for Chandler and he killed himself in 1744. As Thomas Gent describes it, this was<blockquote>an action that for awhile seemed to obumbrate the glory of C&aelig;sar, who found such a deficiency in his partner's accounts, so great a want of money, and such a woful sight of flowing creditors, that made him succumb under the obligation to a statute of bankruptcy. (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 192)</blockquote>To make matters worse, Ward was called before the bar of the House of Commons on 5 April 1745, accused of illegally publishing the proceedings of the house in the <span class="italic">York Courant</span>. The accusations were undeniably true, and Ward was reprimanded by the speaker and fined. Printing parliamentary proceedings was a common offence among the newspaper trade of the day, but the timing of this case was particularly damaging for Ward. His bankruptcy notice appeared in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> in June 1745.<br>
<br>Although Ward had the help of friends, including the York historian Francis Drake, his recovery had much to do with his own determination: he announced in the <span class="italic">York Courant</span> of 25 June 1745 that he had been obliged to sell his printing house to meet his debts; Richard Bucktrout, a former employee, made a further announcement in the same paper that the newspaper and printing business would continue as usual. That was followed early the next year (27 February 1746) by a London sale where Ward's remaining book stock&#151;bound and in quires&#151;as well as his shares were auctioned to his book-trade colleagues for the benefit of his creditors. Somewhat unusually for one of these events, a selection of Ward's silver plate was also offered. Ward was still concerned to repay the partnership's outstanding debts when he wrote his will in October 1756: he directed that his executor should, within three years of his decease, divide &pound;200 among the remaining creditors.<br>
<br>Although Ward took up business again, his book-trade career had changed. Before the bankruptcy he had bookshops in three locations, he was running a successful newspaper, and most of the books in which his name appeared were ones in which he had a financial share. The London shop was in William Sandby's possession before the bankruptcy and Ward spent most of his time in York. The proprietorship of the <span class="italic">York Courant</span> now passed out of his hands, at least for some years. He was listed as the paper's printer again in mid-1747, and he continued to print books for others, even though he no longer held many shares. He printed minor verse, such as Thomas Comber's <span class="italic">Ode to Frugality</span> (1758), and documents for local institutions, but most of his surviving works are sermons. In 1750 he printed Laurence Sterne's <span class="italic">Abuses of Conscience, Set Forth in a Sermon</span>. (Sterne was to turn to Caesar Ward's widow, Ann, when he needed a printer for <span class="italic">Tristram Shandy</span> in 1759.) A further typical example was a two-volume collection of sermons preached by another local, Richard Warneford, vicar of St Martin's, Coney Street, which Ward printed for Warneford's subscribers in 1757.<br>
<br>But one printing job led to the major achievement of Ward's career, the secret co-editorship with Francis Drake of the <span class="italic">Parliamentary or Constitutional History of England</span> in twenty-four volumes (1751&#150;61). As Ward describes the evolution of the <span class="italic">History</span> to Charles Lyttleton, then dean of Exeter,<blockquote>The first 8 Vols. I did little more than soften some Expressions; but the last ten was such a Skeleton of a History, that I can say, with great Truth, I have bestow'd as many Hours, at least, upon it as Mr. D. himself. I do not mean hereby to claim any Share of Honor as an Author&#151;Profit is more suitable to the Circumstance of a Man who has a Wife &amp; 6 Children; and You will please to observe that, <i>by Agreement</i>, I am to disburse the whole Charge of Paper &amp; Print &amp;c. And (this paid) we are to divide the Profits. (Ward to Lyttleton, 13 Jan 1755, BL, Stowe MSS)</blockquote>These claims to motivation notwithstanding, Ward writes with the pleasure of a gifted historian about the work that took up much of his last ten years, tracking down and borrowing manuscript material from collectors such as Horace Walpole, collating originals with printed sources, and including a profitable &#145;three Days Confinement in a Garret of Old Pamphlets&#146;  (Ward to Lyttleton, 18 Sept 1754, BL, Stowe MSS). Drake readily acknowledged Ward as his &#145;Fellow-Labourer&#146;  (Drake to Lyttleton, 25 Aug 1755, BL, Stowe MSS), whose work on the project continued until its near completion at Ward's death on 24 April 1759 of &#145;a violent fever which carried him off in a few Days; to which his over-great Attachment to Business did not a little contribute&#146;  (Drake to Lyttleton, 28 April 1759, BL, Stowe MSS). He was buried at St Martin's, Coney Street, York, on 27 April 1759. The <span class="italic">History</span> was successful enough to go into a second edition in 1762, but, by design, neither editor's name ever appeared on the title-page.<br>
<br>When Ann Ward took over the business after her husband's death, she reassured readers of the <span class="italic">York Courant</span> that the paper would<blockquote>be carried on with the same Diligence and Impartiality as before; under the Conduct of the same Person, who, for some Years last past, has had the principal Management of it; Mr. Ward's own Time being mostly taken up in carrying on a large Work of another Nature. (<span class="italic">York Courant</span>, 1 May 1759)</blockquote>Of the seven children who survived their father, the younger Caesar (<i>b</i>. 1741) also followed the printing trade in London, but the relationship between father and son seems to have been uneasy. In his will Caesar Ward notes that his son should receive &#145;Five Pounds and no more he having already by his Extravagance cost me his proportion&#146;. His daughter Mary married George Peacock, who was to carry on the York printing and bookselling business after the death of Ann Ward on 10 April 1789.<br>
