<span class="headword">Farman,  Henry</span>  (1874&#150;1958), <span class="occ">aviator and aircraft manufacturer</span>, was born in Paris on 28 May 1874, though both of his parents were British. His father, a journalist, had long been resident in France, so that the first language of his three sons was French. Henry (a name by which he liked to be known by his friends, although he adopted the spelling Henri for wider use) was the second of the sons. All three were educated at home and had more freedom to follow their own interests than was usual among their contemporaries. Henry's earliest ambition was to be an artist, and he studied oil painting at the academies Colarossi and Julian in Paris, and in the studio of Gustave Courtois. He soon turned his attention to cycling, and became a champion in the craze sweeping Europe in the early 1890s, riding in competition for the Panhard von Paris Vienne trophy. He then took up motor racing and trained as an engineer. Having entered into a partnership with his brother Richard (Dick), they established the largest motor agency in Paris, the Palais de l'Automobile, dealing in Delauney-Bellevilles, Panhard-Levassors, and Renaults.<br>
<br>However, a near-fatal accident soured Farman's interest in automobiles. His brother Maurice A. Farman (1877&#150;1964), a keen balloonist, had given him his first taste of aeronautics, and he now decided to explore the possibilities of powered flight. He crowned his new interest by purchasing in 1907 a biplane from Gabriel Voisin, who had achieved controlled flight himself only that same year. Farman took delivery of Voisin's biplane in September 1907. Convinced that aviation offered a niche for his talents, he set himself to solve the problem of gaining improved lateral control by discarding the vertical curtains rigged between the wings in the manner of a child's box-kite, replacing them with simple struts and their associated wing-warping controls with movable flaps at the rear of the wings&#151;the precursors of modern ailerons. He undertook a series of experimental flights at Issy-les-Moulineaux, Paris.<br>
<br>Simultaneously Farman worked on an aeroplane of his own design. His name rapidly became associated with competition flying, and his early achievements included an absolute speed record, which was confirmed by the F&eacute;d&eacute;ration A&eacute;ronautique International, of 32.73 m.p.h, and the closed circuit distance record. Then on 13 January 1908, after a number of attempts over four months of endeavour, he succeeded in winning the 50,000 French francs prize for the prix Deutsch Archdeacon by flying a return distance of 1 km, rounding a flagpost placed 500 m from the starting point without landing. He used the greater part of the prize moneys which he amassed through his flying achievements for aviation research and design. During the early months of 1908 he visited both Belgium and the United States on exhibition tours, claiming to be the first man to fly in New York.<br>
<br>Farman's early records had been captured by aircraft powered either by Antoinette or Vivinius liquid-cooled motors, power plants which delivered inadequate power to weight ratios. After adopting the new Gnome rotary motor, an engine developed by his friend Laurent Seguin and capable of giving greater power for less weight, he won further laurels. On 31 October 1908 he took first place in the contest for the grand prix de Rheims, flying the 27 km from Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne to Rheims in twenty minutes. This was the first cross-country flight made in Europe, and one which was made in friendly rivalry with Louis Bl&eacute;riot and outshone his friend Leon Delagrange, the wealthy Parisian sculptor who was also a pioneer of aviation.<br>
<br>In 1909 Farman paid a visit to Great Britain, chiefly to compete at the flying meeting at Blackpool (20 October 1909). Although he won the prizes both for distance (some 47 miles) and speed (36.38 m.p.h.), he proved something of a disappointment to thrill seekers in the crowd, who expected something of the panache they had witnessed from Hubert Latham, who had competed in a gale. Flamboyance was not Farman's way. Always a cautious pilot, he carefully lapped the course with steady precision, leaning slightly forward in the cockpit and keeping low, often with only some 20 feet beneath his wheels, seeming almost to caress the ground with a wing-tip as he rounded a pylon. In November 1909 he achieved a distance record of 137 miles, flying for over four hours.<br>
<br>Farman described his early flying achievements in <span class="italic">The Aviator's Companion</span> (1910), which he co-wrote with his brother Dick. In 1912, with his brother Maurice, also an aviation designer, he founded the firm of Henri et Maurice Farman, which became firmly established at 167 rue de Silly, Billancourt (Seine). After the outbreak of war they were operating at full stretch to construct their pushers of the Longhorn and Shorthorn type. They were used during the early days of the war in Flanders, but thereafter were confined mainly to training use at the schools of the Royal Flying Corps. Their appellations referred to the absence or not of a front elevator, although legend has it that the bovine reference stemmed from a remark from Major John Higgins on seeing a row of these machines: &#145;Voil&agrave;! Les vaches m&eacute;caniques&#146;. Their popularity with military pilots, both British and French, was attested by Air Vice-Marshal Amyas Borton, who recalled that by 20 September 1914 he had completed fifty hours flying at the front in a machine which he had collected from the Farman factory on 24 August.<br>
<br>After the war the Farmans successfully entered the civil aviation market. In 1937 nationalization of the French aviation industry forced the firm to merge with the Hanriot organization, and, having no wish to become mere employees of the state, Henry and Maurice retired. Henry later founded and became the first president of the Association des Amis du Mus&eacute;e de l'Air. He was slightly under average height and with dark good looks, sartorial elegance, and a neat, imperial beard; he was frequently taken to be of Gallic origin, although he did not become a naturalized French citizen until 1937. He died at his home, 55 avenue Foch, Paris, on 17 July 1958.<br>
