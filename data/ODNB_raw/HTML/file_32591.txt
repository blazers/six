<span class="headword">Cousin <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cundell]</span>,  Anne Ross</span>  (1824&#150;1906), <span class="occ">poet and hymn writer</span>, only child of David Ross Cundell, an assistant surgeon of the 33rd regiment at Waterloo, and his wife, Ann, was born in Hull on 27 April 1824. Her family moved soon after to Leith, Midlothian. Educated privately, she became an expert pianist under John Muir Wood. Although raised as an Episcopalian, she became a Presbyterian. In 1847 she married the evangelical minister William Cousin (who was born at Leith in 1812 and died at Edinburgh in 1883). Cousin was called from the Chelsea Presbyterian Church to the Free Church at Irvine, Ayrshire, in 1850, and in 1859 to Melrose. He retired to Edinburgh in 1878.<br>
<br>Described as &#145;a lady of scholarly tastes and artistic temperament&#146;  (<span class="italic">MT</span>, 30), Cousin began publishing anonymous poems in the <span class="italic">Christian Treasury</span> in 1845. The intensity of her poems reflects contemporary religious turbulence in Scotland. Her best-known work is the joyous, visionary hymn &#145;The sands of time are sinking&#146; of 1854. &#145;I wrote it&#146;, she said, &#145;as I sat at work one Saturday evening, and though I threw it off at that time, it was the result of long familiarity with the writings of Samuel Rutherford, especially his Letters&#146;. It appeared first as &#145;The Last Words of Samuel Rutherford&#146; in nineteen stanzas in the <span class="italic">Christian Treasury</span> in 1857. It did not become generally known until J. Hood Wilson (1829&#150;1903) of the Barclay Church, Edinburgh, introduced a version of five verses (only the fourth and fifth of which correspond with the now popular version) into a hymnal, <span class="italic">Service of Praise</span>, in 1865. It achieved wide circulation by its inclusion in many hymnals, including the <span class="italic">Song-Book of the Salvation Army</span> (1953). In Britain it is usually set to the hymn tune &#145;Rutherford&#146; by Chr&eacute;tien Urhan (1790&#150;1845), while in America it is sung to a setting by the American evangelist Ira D. Sankey (1840&#150;1908).<br>
<br>Cousin wrote other popular hymns, including &#145;O Christ, what burdens bowed Thy head&#146; (from the poem &#145;The Substitute&#146;) and &#145;King eternal! King immortal&#146; (from &#145;Adoration&#146;). &#145;To thee and to thy Christ, O God&#146; (from &#145;To God and his Christ&#146;) was included in <span class="italic">Hymns Ancient and Modern</span> (1875).<br>
<br>The refrain of &#145;The Sands of Time&#146; gave the title to Cousin's <span class="italic">Immanuel's Land and other Pieces</span> (1876; 2nd edn, 1896). In this volume of 107 poems she demonstrates her versatility and proficiency, ranging from early Christianity and Scottish history to the anguish of a child's death and other bereavements. <span class="italic">An Anthology of Scottish Women Poets</span> (ed. C. Kerrigan, 1991) includes &#145;Christ within the Veil&#146; and &#145;The Double Search&#146;. The future reputation of the &#145;Scottish Christina Rossetti, with a more pronounced theology&#146;  (Campbell, 147) may depend on compositions neither intended nor adapted for public worship, and Cousin may be appreciated at least as much for expressions of human suffering and aspiration as for celebrations of divine grace.<br>
<br>Anne Ross Cousin had four sons and two daughters. John William Cousin (<i>d</i>. December 1910) included his mother in his <span class="italic">Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature</span> (1910). Twenty-three years a widow, she died in Edinburgh on 6 December 1906. In 1910 a memorial window to Cousin and her husband was placed in St Aidan's United Free Church, Melrose.<br>
