<span class="headword">Collins,  John</span>  (1632?&#150;1687), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, born in England but educated in America, was the son of Edward Collins (<i>d</i>. 1689), a deacon of the Congregational church at Cambridge, Massachusetts. Collins graduated from Harvard College in 1649, proceeding MA in 1652, and was incorporated MA at the University of Cambridge in 1654. He was a fellow and tutor at Harvard for some eighteen months in 1651&#150;3. In the latter year he returned to Britain and was appointed to preach in Scotland and was given &pound;50 for his journey and an income of &pound;200 for the first year. In 1659 he was acting as chaplain to General Monck, whom he accompanied from Scotland to London. Collins was present in a neutral capacity when Monck interviewed the Independent deputies from London, following which in March 1660 Monck dismissed his Independent chaplains and turned to the presbyterians.<br>
<br>Collins held no preferment at the time of the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> of 1662, but is included by Edmund Calamy among the silenced ministers. Subsequently he succeeded Thomas Mallory, who had been ejected from the lectureship of St Michael, Crooked Lane, as pastor of an Independent church in Paved Alley, Lime Street, London. In 1669 Collins is recorded as preaching in Bell Lane, Spitalfields, and on 29 May 1672 he was licensed as a congregational teacher at Duke's Place, Aldgate. He was also one of the six original Pinners' Hall lecturers appointed in 1672, and was obviously very popular among his congregation: Cotton Mather related how when Collins was on his deathbed Matthew Mead &#145;poured out before God for his recovery&#146; and there &#145;was hardly one dry eye to be seen in the great congregation&#146;  (Mather, <span class="italic">Magnalia</span>, 4.200). Nathanael Mather wrote of him, &#145;Hee is one of the best preachers in or about London as most agree; some say the best&#146;  (&#145;Letters&#146;, 68). Edmund Calamy described him as &#145;a man mighty in the scriptures, and one of a sweet temper, and very charitable to all good men, without confining himself to a party&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.838).<br>
<br>Collins maintained strong links with Massachusetts. In 1672 he added a personal recommendation to the collective one of London Independents which he had signed in favour of Leonard Hoar's candidacy as president of Harvard, later having cause to draw attention to the caveats in the original endorsements when Hoar proved a less than successful choice. He also acted as an unofficial agent for the colony, receiving and disbursing funds on its behalf and relaying back to the governor news of court politicking around the New England colonies. He paid, and later stopped on his own authority, the retainer to John Rushworth to represent the colony at court. When plans were in train in early 1675 to purchase the propriety of Maine and New Hampshire for the duke of Monmouth, Collins acted vigorously in investigating the matter on behalf of Massachusetts. Collins informed Governor John Leverett<blockquote>if my owne industry, with the help of Major Thomson [the East India merchant Maurice Thomson], had not sifted this busines, about which I have taken many a step, [Rushworth] had not the least crevise of light into this busines; all he hath and what now hee prosecutes is upon my information. (<span class="italic">Hutchinson Papers</span>, 2.206&#150;7)</blockquote>Collins himself had an interview with the earl of Anglesey, the lord privy seal, over the business. However, Collins continued, his own situation, especially as the renewal of the persecution of dissent loomed, limited the direct influence he could wield for the colony: he had &#145;not bin at Whitehall but twice in many years; and persecution is pretty hot, and if it goes on I may expect a prison for my living in the towne&#146;  (ibid.). In 1683 Collins was rewarded by the Massachusetts general court for his services for the colony when it lacked an official agent with the grant of 500 acres of land in Quenetusset in the Nipnuck country.<br>
<br>Collins apparently wrote very little. A sermon on <span class="roman">Jude</span> was published in 1663 in <span class="italic">A Compleat Collection of Farewell-Sermons</span> by silenced ministers, in which he discussed how to retain and manage faith. Another sermon, &#145;How the religious of a nation are the strength of it&#146;, was published anonymously in Samuel Annesley's <span class="italic">A Continuation of Morning-Exercise Questions and Cases of Conscience</span> (1683). He also wrote two prefatory epistles, one to Ralph Venning's <span class="italic">Venning's Remains, or, Christ's School</span> (1675) and the other to a work by the New England divine Jonathan Mitchel, <span class="italic">Discourse of the Glory to which God hath called Believers</span> (1677).<br>
<br>Collins was subject to recurring bouts of ill health. At the beginning of August 1687 Nathanael Mather reported that<blockquote>Mr Collins is in a weak &amp; wasted condicon as to his bodily health (by a scorbuticall diarrhoea as the physicians agree which hath hung upon him these many years). He is now at Tunbridg, by which waters he hath formerly had reviving many times. (&#145;Letters&#146;, 67&#150;8)</blockquote>On this occasion, however, the cure had little effect. Collins died less than four months later, of a dropsy, and was buried at Bunhill Fields on 22 November 1687. His will, made three weeks earlier, gave his residence as St Giles Cripplegate; his mother and father, as well as his wife (whose name we do not know), were all alive at that point. Collins's only daughter had died in 1674; of the four sons named who survived, two&#151;Thomas and John&#151;entered the ministry. Nathanael Mather, who provided a Latin epitaph for Collins, succeeded him as pastor of the Lime Street congregation, and was in turn succeeded by Collins's son Thomas, who was elected co-pastor in 1697.<br>
