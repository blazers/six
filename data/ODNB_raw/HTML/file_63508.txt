<span class="headword">Gregory,  Robert</span>  (1729?&#150;1810), <span class="occ">director of the East India Company and politician</span>, was born in co. Galway, Ireland. Little is known of his background other than that he was the son of Henry Gregory of Galway and his wife, Mary, daughter of Robert Shaw of Newford, also in Galway. His family, who had been established in Ireland under Cromwell, had sufficient influence to obtain for him a licence from the East India Company to trade as an independent, or &#145;free&#146;, merchant in India, and he arrived in Bengal about 1747. After a long and successful career in India he was described by Robert Clive, then governor of Bengal, as a &#145;great Merchant having acquired a Fortune of one hundred thousand Pounds sterling in Trade in the most Honourable Manner, his Integrity &amp; Abilities are unquestionable &amp; his Character a very respectable one&#146;  (Clive to J. Walsh, 5 Feb 1766, BL OIOC, MS Eur D546/1, fol. 131).<br>
<br>Gregory returned from India in 1766. He acquired Coole Park in his native Galway and Valence in Kent, and it was at the latter that he settled. Seeking election to parliament, he approached Lord Rockingham, leader of the main opposition party. He made a good impression on Rockingham who described him as a &#145;gentleman of good fortune &hellip; and whose character and abilities I think well of&#146;  (Rockingham to Newcastle, 4 March 1768, BL, Add. MS 32989, fols. 29&#150;30). Gregory sought Rockingham's help in finding a seat but was concerned that &#145;where he stood it might be with the countenance of the neighbouring gentlemen and some old and known interest, as thinking that ground was better and freer from the accusation of coming as an adventurer&#146;  (ibid.). With Rockingham's help he stood for Maidstone on the interest of Lord Aylesford and was elected comfortably. In parliament Gregory voted consistently with the opposition, but built a reputation for independence of party in Indian matters. During debates in 1773 on Lord North's bill to regulate the company's Indian administration, he declared that:<blockquote>most of the gentlemen now in India are my particular friends, but I am willing to do all I can for the ease of the inhabitants of India. A place without law can never be happy. I prefer the happiness of seventeen million of souls to the emoluments of my friends. (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1754&#150;90</span>)</blockquote>Gregory was elected to the company's court of directors in 1769 and here too he professed to put the interest of the company before his own. He became closely involved in the company's campaign to defeat North's <span class="roman">East India Regulating Bill</span> and continued to act in this with Lord Rockingham who retained the &#145;Highest opinion&#146; of his integrity and knowledge in Indian matters  (Rockingham to Edmund Burke, <i>post</i> 13 Dec 1773, quoted in Sutherland, 2.497). But Gregory did have more personal interests in Indian affairs, particularly through longstanding business connections with Maharaja Nandakumar. Nandakumar had once enjoyed power and influence at the court of the nawab of Bengal, a puppet of the company by the 1760s, but had been removed during the governorship of Robert Clive. Gregory had taken Nandakumar's case to Clive, and later, when a company director, acted as his London agent (Khan, 290, 300&#150;01; &#145;Letters of Richard Barwell&#146;, 107). When Laurence Sulivan, Clive's powerful rival for control of the company, was re-elected to the court of directors in 1771, Gregory supported him in ordering the dismissal of Clive's allies in the company's Bengal administration who stood in the way of Nandakumar's return to power. There seems little doubt that Nandakumar's involvement in the political intrigues in Bengal against the governor-general, Warren Hastings, in the 1770s influenced Gregory's own views of Hastings's governorship. Hastings was told by a friend, Francis Sykes: &#145;I dined yesterday with Gregory &hellip; and others and find that Nundcomar writes them everything wch happens and something more, by every ship. This is a fact for I found they had everything from him&#146;  (Khan, 300&#150;01). Nandakumar was brought to trial in Bengal for his intrigues, and executed, and Gregory joined the growing party at East India House calling for Hastings's recall.<br>
<br>Gregory lost his parliamentary seat in the 1774 election but was returned after a contest at Rochester. He opposed the American war and voted against the North government on all but Indian issues, where he committed himself to vote with the government in any legislation that represented the mutual interests of the public and the company. When Edmund Burke pledged himself, Gregory, and the opposition to support the government in any such measure, Gregory refused to be bound by such a pledge, saying that he &#145;stood connected with no party, nor with the honourable Member &hellip; he would give his opinion freely, and his support where he thought it due &hellip; being as independent in his principles and his seat as any man in the House&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1754&#150;90</span>).<br>
<br>Following a ballot in the House of Commons for membership of a committee of inquiry into the war in the Indian Carnatic, Gregory's reputation and stature ensured that he came top of the poll, receiving support from both sides of the house. In the following year he was elected chairman of the East India Company. Although professedly more sympathetic now to Hastings's governorship after the committee of inquiry's findings, Gregory found it difficult to take the company's line in defence of Warren Hastings when the Pitt government tried to have him removed. He was described to Hastings by a friend as &#145;your shifting friend (the backward way) &hellip; upon the whole against You, altho pretends a great deal of candour&#146;  (J. Woodman to Hastings, 24 June 1782, BL, Add. MS 29154, fol. 479).<br>
<br>In 1782 Gregory had a serious illness and resigned his chairmanship of the company. Such was his reputation that he was still named as one of the commissioners for Indian affairs in Fox's <span class="roman">East India Bill</span> in 1783. His last parliamentary speech was in support of the bill later that year. He did not stand in the 1784 general election. With his wife, Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nimmo, the daughter of an East India merchant, Gregory had a daughter and three sons, the youngest of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11474/', "William Gregory (1762&#150;1840)")</script>, was under-secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland. Three children of Robert Gregory were baptized at Calcutta on 3 February 1766; their mother's name is given as Johanna in the official records, possibly a clerical error. Gregory died in Berners Street, London, on 1 September 1810, aged eighty-one.<br>
