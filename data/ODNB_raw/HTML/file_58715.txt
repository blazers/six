<span class="headword">Abbott,  Peter Harriss</span>  (1774/5&#150;1850), <span class="occ">accountant and official assignee</span>, was born on the island of St Christopher in the West Indies, the son of Peter Abbott and Jane Dijett. Abbott's early career remains obscure, but it is known that by 1812 he was in business as a merchant working from 121 New City Chambers, Bishopsgate Within, in the City of London. There are many examples of merchants developing commercial skills and subsequently setting up in business as public accountants, and this was the route followed by Abbott, who was listed as an &#145;accountant&#146; in the <span class="italic">Post Office London Directory</span> for 1823. Abbott has been described as &#145;the leading public accountant of the day&#146;  (Bywater, 791), and, in the years that followed, William Quilter and John Ball&#151;individuals who played leading roles in the formation of a professional accounting body in London in 1870&#151;trained in his office. Indeed one of Quilter's obituarists described Abbott as the &#145;practical founder of the profession of public accountants in this country&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Accountant</span>).<br>
<br>It was as a public accountant expert in bookkeeping matters that Abbott was first called in to advise the government. The state of central government financial accounting and control was the subject of vitriolic attack in parliament during the 1820s, particularly from radicals led by Joseph Hume. The prime minister, Wellington, appointed a parliamentary finance committee in 1828 that called for the establishment of a &#145;commission of experts, whose duty it would be to examine the wasteful system of Public Accounts and recommend judicious improvements&#146;  (Bartle, 113). Abbott and two civil servants were appointed Treasury commissioners for that purpose. It was not a successful liaison.<br>
<br>The civil servants, Thomas Constantinus Brooksbank and Samuel Beltz, were determined to ensure that reforms built on the long-established system of central government bookkeeping. Abbott was equally keen to impose on civil servants the commercially oriented &#145;mercantile&#146; system of bookkeeping, an early attempt to apply what would today be described as a private sector solution to a public sector problem. Brooksbank and Beltz won a debate that descended into sharp attacks by each party on the other, but this reversal does not appear to have harmed Abbott's stock with the government. In the course of giving evidence to a select committee in 1837 Abbott revealed that he had been frequently consulted and employed by the government and had recommended the introduction of &#145;the commercial system of double entry&#146; into each of the twenty-eight government offices he had surveyed. He also claimed to be in the process of introducing reforms at the excise department that &#145;would get rid of at least 700 volumes of books&#146; and result in estimated savings of &#145;300,000<i>l</i>. a year in the administration of the department&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1837, 7, questions 1312&#150;13). Confirmation of Abbott's continuing involvement in the reform of public accountancy was provided by John Bowring, who in 1844 reported the results of an inquiry into changes made in the system of bookkeeping in government offices since 1831. Abbott's enduring interest in central government finances is further reflected in his pamphlet <span class="italic">On the Public Debt, with a Plan for its Final Extinction</span> (1839).<br>
<br>When Abbott was in his mid-forties his career moved in a new direction. The availability of bankruptcy and liquidation work, particularly during periods of economic distress, was a major source of profitable employment for many accountants during the nineteenth century. The <span class="roman">Bankruptcy Act</span> of 1831 was a significant milestone in the history of the accounting profession since it made provision for the appointment of accountants to the newly created position of official assignee. The lawyer Arthur Woolf, writing in 1912, believed that this &#145;first official recognition of accountants by the State &hellip; must have done much to increase the prestige of the profession&#146;  (Woolf, 174). Abbott's appointment proved reasonably lucrative, giving him an average annual remuneration of &pound;694 10<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. But this proved woefully inadequate to meet Abbott's financial requirements. In the spring of 1841 he absconded to Brussels with, allegedly, &pound;82,196 &#145;in his hands&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1850, 19, question 167). He was adjudged bankrupt in April of that year, with sources reporting claims outstanding against his estate of up to &pound;100,000. Only about &pound;1200 was collected and, probably due to expenses involved, this was deemed insufficient to enable a dividend to be paid to the creditors.<br>
<br>A possible explanation for this perhaps aberrant behaviour on the part of Abbott is contained in a letter written to the former lord chancellor, Lord Brougham, in 1845. Brougham drew the House of Lords' attention to Abbott's claim that &#145;the grave offence for which he had suffered&#146; had been perpetrated because he had been defrauded of the whole of his property. Although no justification for Abbott's behaviour, Brougham felt it to be &#145;a palliation of his conduct&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard</span> 3, 78, 3 March 1845, 232). Whatever the reasons for his need of the money, it is certain that Abbott showed little regard for the regulations applying to his position as official registrar. Contrary to these, he &#145;engaged in several speculative trading companies&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1850, 19, question 176). When Abbott's legal representatives had attempted to stifle proceedings against him in the court of bankruptcy Sir John Cross described it as &#145;a lamentable case, in which a public officer, who was bound not to trade, had set the restriction at nought, and mixed himself up in various commercial dealings&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>).<br>
<br>Abbott died in Brussels on 9 May 1850. His death certificate describes him as &#145;directeur de la banque anglaise&#146; and further reveals the fact that he was the widower of Catherine Hodges. He had been respected within government circles, and raised the profile of the accounting occupational group with the state, thereby helping to pave the way for the closer links between central government and the accounting profession that gained pace in Victorian and Edwardian Britain and blossomed during and after the First World War. Even in disgrace he left his mark: his defalcation was of such proportions as to require a major strengthening of the regulations relating to the apprehension of bankrupts, the seizure of their assets, and the actions and accountability of official assignees.<br>
