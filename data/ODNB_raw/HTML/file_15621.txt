<span class="headword">Kingsley,  William</span>  (1698/9&#150;1769), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the son of William Kingsley (1669&#150;1705), army officer and landowner, of St Anne's parish, Westminster, and his wife, Alice, daughter and heir of William Randolph of Maidstone, Kent. He was a direct descendant from William Kingsley, archdeacon of Canterbury (1584&#150;1647), who established the Kingsleys, who were of Lancashire origin, as a Kentish landed family in the mid-seventeenth century; from him Charles Kingsley the novelist also traced his descent.<br>
<br>Kingsley's father, William, was an ensign in Sir Edward Dering's regiment of foot (later the 24th foot) which was raised in Kent in March 1689 for service in William III's Irish campaign. He remained in service in Ireland and Flanders, latterly in Colonel William Selwyn's regiment of foot, until he retired on half-pay in 1697. Kingsley's mother had brought her husband considerable property in Maidstone including a residence thenceforward known as Kingsley House, as well as an estate in the parish of Kennington, near Ashford, in Kent.<br>
<br>Kingsley matriculated at St John's, Oxford, on 19 November 1717, aged eighteen, but he did not take a degree. On 24 June 1721 he was commissioned lieutenant and captain in the 3rd foot guards (later the Scots Guards) in the company commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Wolfe, father of General James Wolfe. He was promoted captain-lieutenant in the same regiment in 1743; captain and lieutenant-colonel in 1745; brevet colonel in 1750; and regimental major, with the rank of colonel of foot, on 29 January 1751. He was aide-de-camp to his colonel, John Murray, second earl of Dunmore, at Dettingen, and was present with the 1st battalion of his regiment at the battle of Fontenoy, where a cannon-ball passed between his legs and killed four men behind him, on 11 May 1745. When the collected grenadier companies of the several regiments of guards marched from London for the north in the following December (the &#145;march to Finchley&#146;), he was one of the officers sent ahead into Northamptonshire by the duke of Cumberland to obtain information of the enemy's movements. He was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the Scots guards in 1752. On 22 May 1756 Kingsley was made colonel of the Lancashire Fusiliers. James Wolfe, then lieutenant-colonel of the regiment at Devizes, wrote of him: &#145;Our new colonel is a sensible man, and very sociable and polite&#146;  (Smyth, 37n.).<br>
<br>Kingsley was with his regiment in the Rochefort expedition of 1757, and afterwards went to Germany as major-general (commission dated 20 January 1758). He greatly distinguished himself at the battle of Minden on 1 August 1759, at the head of a brigade composed of the 20th (Kingsley's), 25th (Home's), and 51st (Brudenell's) foot, which was very prominently engaged. &#145;Kingsley's grenadiers&#146;, as the 20th was popularly called, is said to have marched through some gardens or hedges where the men put roses in their buttonholes, a circumstance subsequently commemorated by the regimental custom of wearing &#145;Minden roses&#146; in the caps on each anniversary of the day. The successful advance of the &#145;Minden battalions&#146; is still regarded as a feat of bravery and endurance without parallel in the campaigns of the British army in the eighteenth century. The regiment had six officers and eighty men killed and eleven officers and 224 men wounded, and was excused from all further duty on account of its losses. In his general order of 2 August, Prince Ferdinand complimented both Kingsley and Waldegrave, his fellow commander, &#145;for their great courage, and the good order in which they conducted their brigades&#146;  (Smyth, 57). On 4 August a countermanding order announced: &#145;Kingsley's regiment of the British line will resume its share of the duty at its own request&#146;. Kingsley was afterwards engaged at Ziezenberg and elsewhere. He was appointed governor of Fort William on 22 March 1760 but did not reside there. He became a lieutenant-general in December 1760, and was appointed to the command of a secret expedition, with William Draper as his quartermaster-general. The force was at first destined for eastward of the Cape, but was afterwards ordered to rendezvous at Quiberon for an attempt on Belle &Icirc;le on the coast of Brittany. The death of George II and other circumstances delayed the expedition, and Kingsley's orders were eventually countermanded. He was not actively employed again.<br>
<br>Kingsley was an outspoken, independent Englishman, extremely popular with his soldiers, and an active freemason. He was over seventy years of age and unmarried at the time of his death at Kingsley House, Stone Street, Maidstone, on 9 October 1769. He was buried in the family vault at St Mary's Church, Kennington, near Ashford, Kent. Upon inheriting the family estates he had bequeathed most of the property, for life, to his sister, Alicia, who married Stephen Otway, of Maidstone. However, she died before him in 1761. His other sister, Caroline, a spinster, died in 1756. By his will of 16 March 1764 (proved on 26 October 1769) Kingsley House and his estates in Kennington, Patricksbourne, and elsewhere, passed to his first cousin, Charles Kingsley, of London. The mansion remained in the family's possession until sold for building sites in the mid-nineteenth century. It was demolished in 1855.<br>
