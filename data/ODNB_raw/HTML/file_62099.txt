<span class="headword">Robinson, Sir  Kenneth</span>  (1911&#150;1996), <span class="occ">politician and public servant</span>, was born on 19 March 1911 at Latchford House, Warrington, Lancashire, the son of Clarence Robinson, medical practitioner, and his wife, Ethel Marion, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Linnell. Robinson himself was a forlorn <i>m&eacute;decin manqu&eacute;</i>. He was devotedly ambitious to follow his father's work, although he knew the disruptive effects on family life of a GP's professional obligations. But that dedicated hope was cruelly destroyed when his adored father died while he was still at school, at Oundle, aged fifteen. His mother could not afford for him to go to university, and he was forced to take a job as an insurance broker at Lloyds, where he developed an understanding of financial affairs, but did not enjoy the work. In a freak of fortune the war released him from his unloved desk. He enlisted in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as an ordinary seaman. He served in the Mediterranean and Far East and emerged as a lieutenant-commander. On 18 April 1941, while on leave, he married Helen Elizabeth Edwards (<i>d</i>. 1993), daughter of Frederick Hartnoll Edwards, an interior decorator. She was at that time working as a claims examiner in the War Damage Commission. There was one daughter of the marriage.<br>
<br>Robinson had long been concerned with the inequalities of life, and had joined his local Labour Party in St Pancras. But he was surprised to receive a telegram while in service in India from St Pancras asking him if he would agree to be a candidate for the local council in 1945. This was the cusp of his life. He arrived at the first post-war statutory meeting of the St Pancras borough council still in his service uniform, and he stayed in public service for ever. His main contribution as a councillor was the setting up of the St Pancras Arts Council (now Camden Festival). He had a passion for sharing the good life&#151;he wanted the engine drivers from King's Cross, Euston, or St Pancras, who either left or arrived in the dawn (while their wives were setting off to clean the lavatories in the trains before they took their children to school), to have fair access to some enjoyment and a lift to their minds and spirits. The area had endured a tough, damaging war and the new councillors faced many problems and demands.<br>
<br>Robinson had gone back to daily work as a company secretary, and had never referred to any other political ambitions. But there was no surprise in the area that when George House, MP for North St Pancras, died in 1949, Robinson was nominated as Labour candidate. On 10 March 1949 he polled 16,185 votes to the 11,118 of the Conservative candidate, and thus started the next phase of his life. At first in parliament he was modestly quiet. He was made a whip and looked on as a safe pair of hands. However, that was not for long. Because he joined Aneurin Bevan in a revolt in 1954 of sixty-four MPs against the British manufacture of the H-bomb without parliament's consent, he was temporarily in disgrace and expelled to the back benches. Freed from the whips' rules of silence in the chamber, he became noticed as one of the most liberal and progressive members, who took on many of the least popular causes. He was chairman of the mental health committee of the North-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. In the house, when he obtained time for a private member's motion, he introduced the first debate in over twenty years on mental health. He and others continued to crusade for improvements, which led to the passing of the <span class="roman">Mental Health Act</span> of 1959. He worked successfully for a bill which ended suicide or attempted suicide being a common-law crime. In 1961 he introduced his own bill to reform the abortion law. Although it was talked out, it was one more step on the way. He was also active in debates on the Wolfenden report in 1960. He spoke movingly on the plight of homosexuals. He called for the government to legislate for the reforms recommended in part 2 of the report. He was defeated; but he collected ninety-nine votes, twenty-two of them from Conservatives. It was another step on the way to another liberalization.<br>
<br>It was no surprise when Gaitskell, who did not always agree with him, appointed Robinson number two to Dr Edith Summerskill, the shadow minister of health, in 1961. In 1964 Wilson appointed him minister of health (after Summerskill had gone to the Lords), but without a seat in cabinet. He worked hard and was admired and popular both in the house and with the medical profession&#151;not an easy achievement. He was always courteous, with a quiet wisdom and an independent mind. But machinations were under way in the Labour Party. Richard Crossman, ambitious and arrogant at times, persuaded the cabinet that it would be a good idea to combine the ministries of Health and Social Security, with himself as minister of both. Robinson was of course aware of the proposals. His good manners and even temper prevailed&#151;on the surface. But he was bitterly disappointed, and so were his friends and many colleagues. He invited Crossman to the twentieth anniversary of the National Health Service, held in the Banqueting Hall in July 1968. Crossman wrote in his <span class="italic">Diaries</span>:<blockquote>He [Robinson] did have the courtesy to introduce me to the Secretary of the BMA and one or two other bigwigs. When I get into my new job I shall find myself in a completely new world, nothing like local government. Nobody knows me by sight and I don't know them. What's worse, they all know that I am working Kenneth Robinson out of a job and by all their tests he was an excellent Minister. (Crossman, 118)</blockquote>Wilson created a job for Robinson as minister for planning and land under Tony Greenwood, but it was obviously an ungracious sop. Within a few months the new job was abolished by mutual consent and he spent his last few months on the back benches, often reading in the library between divisions, and enjoying the leisure time for the arts and various charities.<br>
<br>In 1969 Robinson left parliament. He took a job on the board of the British Steel Corporation, first as director of social policy and then as managing director of the personnel and social policy division, which he felt was a real and demanding position at a time when the industry faced many growing pains. In 1975 he was offered the chairmanship of the London Transport executive and he stayed until 1978, when he was forced to retire ten months early, following a bitter controversy with Horace Cutler, leader of the Conservative majority on the Greater London council, over the level of subsidies. Meanwhile, in 1977 he had become chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain. The wheel had come full circle from the St Pancras arts festival. He had long managed much voluntary work&#151;he had assisted the National Trust and the Carnegie Council on Arts and Disabled People, and had been chairman of English National Opera and the Young Concert Artists Trust. He had also written <span class="italic">Policy for Mental Health</span> (1958), <span class="italic">Patterns of Care</span> (1961), and <span class="italic">Look at Parliament</span> (1962), as well as an elegant life of Wilkie Collins (1951). He was also a much appreciated trustee of the Imperial War Museum. He was its commissioner for works of art and had the job of obtaining paintings of British forces on duty all over the world. He was often helpful in advising the museum how to deal with Whitehall. Robinson was happy in his last job. His interests were shared by his wife, Elizabeth, who was also a councillor in St Pancras at the same time and was a talented amateur artist.<br>
<br>After he retired in 1983 Robinson was knighted. Many people&#151;not only friends&#151;hoped he would be elevated to the House of Lords. He deserved it more than some, and would have been more use than many. With his caring, sympathetic concern for other people's disadvantages, and his sense of the personal responsibility of everyone to do something about the deprivations which disfigured society, he contributed a civilized element to public life&#151;in or out of parliament. But the selfishness of politics does not often reward the unselfish. Robinson's enjoyment of his retirement was marred by the death of his wife in 1993. Robinson himself died of a heart attack at the Royal Free Hospital, Camden, on 16 February 1996. He was survived by his daughter.<br>
