<span class="headword">Banks,  John</span>  (1652/3&#150;1706), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born in obscurity. Before embarking upon a career as a playwright, he enrolled at the New Inn court of chancery where he was trained in the law. However, following the success of Nathaniel Lee's <span class="italic">The Rival Queens</span> at Drury Lane in March 1677, Banks turned his attention to the stage. His first tragedy, <span class="italic">The Rival Kings</span>, was performed at Drury Lane in June 1677 and published shortly afterwards. In November 1678 a second tragedy, <span class="italic">The Destruction of Troy</span>, was acted at Dorset Garden, with the text of the play published the following January.<br>
<br>After the failure of his third play, <span class="italic">Cyrus the Great, or, The Tragedy of Love</span> (written in 1681), which was rejected by the actors, the playwright revised his style. Abandoning the bombastic language of his early tragedies, Banks produced a series of dramas based upon episodes drawn from English history. In May 1681 the company at Drury Lane staged <span class="italic">The Unhappy Favourite, or, The Earl of Essex</span>, which appeared with a prologue and epilogue by John Dryden. A further historical tragedy, <span class="italic">Vertue Betray'd, or, Anna Bullen</span>, was staged at Dorset Garden in March 1682. In 1684 the playwright's third attempt at exploring Tudor history, <span class="italic">The Island Queens, or, The Death of Mary, Queen of Scotland</span>, was banned from the stage, presumably on account of its contentious portrayal of the rivalry between Elizabeth I and her Catholic cousin. Although Banks's sympathetic portrayal of Mary Stuart met with the approval of the Catholic duke of York, the ban on the play remained in force, obliging Richard Bentley to publish a quarto text of the tragedy &#145;in Defence of the Author and the Play&#146; in 1684. This failure of <span class="italic">The Island Queens</span> to reach the stage appears to have impoverished the playwright, Robert Gould noting in 1685 that Banks was now &#145;in Tatters&#146; as a result of his &#145;bad Poetry&#146;  (Gould, 2.241).<br>
<br>Following the death of Charles II Banks resumed his legal career, and on 21 February 1691 he married Elizabeth Thompson (<i>c</i>.1662&#150;1702) at St Paul's, Covent Garden. However, his name continued to be connected with the theatre. In 1694 Bentley published Banks's <span class="italic">The Innocent Usurper, or, The Death of the Lady Jane Gray</span>, a dramatization of the Tudor succession crisis of 1553. Although Banks claimed to have written the play ten years earlier, an attempt by the United Company to stage the play in the 1692&#150;3 season was thwarted by the lord chamberlain, who noticed in Banks's tragedy a series of reflections upon the accession of William and Mary in 1689. In December 1695 the playwright's <span class="italic">Cyrus the Great</span> was finally produced at Drury Lane. However, the tragedy enjoyed only four performances, its run being cut short by the death of the actor William Smith. Following the death of his wife in May 1702, Banks began work on an adaptation of his earlier play, <span class="italic">The Island Queens</span>, striving to offer the censor a more sympathetic portrait of Elizabeth I. The resulting tragedy, <span class="italic">The Albion Queens</span>, proved popular with the Drury Lane audience, running for seven nights in March 1704, although the text of the play remained unpublished until the end of Queen Anne's reign. Despite this success, Banks again appears to have fallen into debt. He died in April 1706, owing money to two principal creditors. On 9 April 1706 he was buried at St James's Church, Westminster.<br>
<br>Although Banks's early heroic plays were soon forgotten, his historical tragedies, with their protracted scenes of sadness and distress, proved influential. In <span class="italic">Vertue Betray'd</span> and <span class="italic">The Albion Queens</span>, Banks pioneered the &#145;she-tragedy&#146;, a dramatic form peculiar to the late Restoration. This genre of tragedy, which abandoned the concept of poetic justice in favour of a persistent emphasis upon the suffering of an innocent heroine, was later popularized by Nicholas Rowe.<br>
