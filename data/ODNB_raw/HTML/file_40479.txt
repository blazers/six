<span class="headword">Price <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Maude]</span>,  (Lillian) Nancy Bache</span>  (1880&#150;1970), <span class="occ">actress and author</span>, was born on 3 February 1880 at Rockmount in the small village of Kinver on the Worcestershire/Staffordshire border, the daughter of William Henry Price and his wife, Sarah Julia Mannix. Her father was &#145;an aristocrat by birth and choice&#146;, a pillar of the local church community, but a remote parent. She had a stronger bond with her mother, who encouraged her artistic talents. Following the death of her elder sister, May, at the age of five from diphtheria, Nancy was brought up as an only child. She sketched, wrote diaries, and played the violin until her father, who was worried about her health and posture, stopped her from doing so, according to one of her several accounts. She attended the village school at the age of nine, before being sent away to a boarding-school, Malvern Wells, which she hated.<br>
<br>Nancy Price had an independent streak in her character. One teacher called her &#145;not naughty but rather wild&#146;  (Price, <span class="italic">Into an Hour Glass</span>, 16). She liked to think of herself as a vagabond, as in the titles of her later books, such as <span class="italic">Vagabond's Way</span> (1914) and <span class="italic">The Heart of a Vagabond</span> (1955). She was thought by her parents to be a sickly child, but she liked riding and walking. Her childhood memories of the midlands landscape delighted her readers, among them Lord Dunsany, who described her tribute to the Lake District, <span class="italic">Shadows on the Hills</span> (1935), as the &#145;book of my choice&#146;.<br>
<br>Nancy Price decided to become an actor at the age of fourteen, a choice of profession which her father deplored for moral and economic reasons. She joined F. R. Benson's company in her last term at school and made her non-speaking stage d&eacute;but at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham, in September 1899. Benson staged the summer Shakespeare seasons at Stratford upon Avon, one of the best training grounds for young actors in the United Kingdom. He was also famous for his love of sport and Nancy Price suspected that she was chosen for her skills at golf, tennis, and hockey, as well for her acting. But she was talented enough to attract the attention of the actor&#150;manager Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, whose premi&egrave;res at His Majesty's Theatre then provided the high points of London's theatre seasons.<br>
<br>Tree cast Price as Calypso in Stephen Phillips's <span class="italic">Ulysses</span> (February 1902), a four-hour epic, described in <span class="italic">The Times</span> as &#145;a majestic enterprise&#146;  (3 Feb 1902). Samuel Coleridge-Taylor composed the incidental music and the sculptor Auguste Rodin designed the sets. Nancy Price was described as &#145;authentically Homeric&#146;, and also as &#145;the nymph with braided tresses&#146;, and her success led to further West End roles. A. W. Pinero wrote for her the part of Hilda Gunning, the shop-girl with airs above her station, in <span class="italic">Letty</span> (1904), a forerunner of Bernard Shaw's Eliza Doolittle. Max Beerbohm concluded of her performance that &#145;every sentence rang phonographically true&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 April 1970). She played several seasons with Tree's company and Sir Henry Irving wanted her to play Portia to his Shylock, but she had a prior engagement and turned him down. Nancy Price joined the Pioneer Players at the Kingsway Theatre in 1911 in a season which included &#145;feministic&#146; plays. In 1913 she appeared as India in Sir Edward Elgar's <span class="italic">Crown of India</span>.<br>
<br>On 17 May 1907 Nancy Price married Charles Raymond Maude (1881/2&#150;1943) at a register office; he was an actor who came from a family distinguished for its army and stage connections. His grandmother was Jenny Lind, the &#145;Swedish nightingale&#146;. Their marriage lasted until his death in 1943 and they had two daughters, Joan and Elizabeth, who both became actresses. According to her memoirs it was not an easy relationship. She had many &#145;affairs of the heart&#146; and complained that in art as well as life her husband was a perfectionist. He was a member of Harley Granville Barker's repertory company at the Duke of York's Theatre in 1910, a season distinguished for new-wave drama, including Granville Barker's <span class="italic">The Madras House</span> and <span class="italic">Waste</span>. But his acting career was short. In the First World War he applied for a commission and rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel; but he retired from the stage after the war and never acted again.<br>
<br>During the war Nancy Price continued to act but also raised money for war charities, worked with the blind, and in one bizarre episode, joined a ship's crew off the east coast as a cook, which provided some vivid descriptions for her book, <span class="italic">The Gull's Way</span> (1937). During the 1920s she was an established leading lady, if not of the first rank, playing in Sutton Vane's <span class="italic">Outward Bound</span> (1924), Pirandello's <span class="italic">Henry IV</span> (1925), and opposite Mrs Patrick Campbell in Ibsen's <span class="italic">John Gabriel Borkman</span> (1928). She lectured on Shakespeare and illustrated her talks with extracts, and led a remarkably active social life in which (from her memoirs) she seems to have met almost every famous person in western Europe from Cork in Ireland (where she had relatives) to Rome, where she met Mussolini. She was committed to many of what were then good causes, among them anti-vivisection and state subsidies for the theatre. &#145;Even the half-starved Serbian peasant&#146;, she wrote in 1940, &#145;pays tribute to the upkeep of the theatre&#146;  (Price, <span class="italic">Nettles and Docks</span>, 33).<br>
<br>The aim was to establish subsidized repertory companies along the continental lines. Shaw and Granville Barker campaigned for a national theatre, while Lilian Baylis at the Old Vic claimed that hers was the true national theatre. In 1930 Nancy Price joined forces with the playwright&#150;manager J. T. Grein, to found the People's National Theatre, which produced eighty-two plays in various theatres over a period of twenty years. Grein, who died in 1935, soon left the company, but Price became its honorary director. Under her leadership the company presented a worthy repertory of history plays by such writers as Clifford Bax and John Drinkwater, poetic dramas including those of W. B. Yeats, and &#145;realist&#146; plays in the style of Ibsen and Shaw. Her most popular role was as the grandmother, Adeline, in Mazo de la Roche's <span class="italic">Whiteoaks</span> (1936), which ran for two years. &#145;Amazing!&#146;, wrote Shaw, &#145;There has been nothing like it in London since Irving captured it with <span class="italic">The Bells</span>!&#146;  (Price, <span class="italic">Into an Hour Glass</span>, 183), which she took as a compliment. Her finer performances were held to be as Mrs Jones in Galsworthy's <span class="italic">The Silver Box</span> (1931) and as Edith Cavell in <span class="italic">Nurse Cavell</span> (1934).<br>
<br>As Adeline, Nancy Price had an on-stage parrot, Boney, with whom she became very friendly. Her interest in all kinds of birds, mammals, and natural landscapes is a feature of all her books, which numbered over twenty. She was a founder of the Council of Justice to Animals. A talented amateur naturalist, she wrote with equal enthusiasm about the wildlife in London's parks as about the Sussex Downs. At first she disliked the cinema, but appeared in some non-starring film parts, and edited a theatre magazine called <span class="italic">Pedlar's Pack</span>. In their day, Nancy Price's books were popular and widely read. Through them she scattered names in short but not very revealing anecdotes. She drove with Sir Malcolm Campbell and recalls the &#145;many delightful hours I spent with Elgar in his studio&#146;, without relating what happened in either car or studio. Her style evoked the world of P. G. Wodehouse.<br>
<br>Nancy Price was indisputably what Wooster would have called &#145;a good egg&#146;. In his foreword to <span class="italic">Nettles and Docks</span> (1940) Norman Birkett described her as &#145;a fighter on the side of all things which are honourable and true and of good report amongst men&#146;. She was made a CBE in 1950 for her services to the theatre and died on 31 March 1970 at 145 Rowlands Road, Worthing, Sussex.<br>
