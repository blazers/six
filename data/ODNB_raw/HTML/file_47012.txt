<span class="headword">Friswell, Sir  Charles Ernest Hain</span>  (1871&#150;1926), <span class="occ">motor car distributor and manufacturer</span>, was born on 30 December 1871 at 17 Buckingham Street, Marylebone, the son of George Friswell, advertising agent, and his wife, Jane Street. He received a private education, but little is known about his personal life. Friswell married Edith Kate Frewer in 1905; they had no children.<br>
<br>Like many others, Friswell entered the world of the automobile from that of the cycle, at first combining an agency for cycles with other business interests. Friswells Ltd was established in London in 1896 with a capital of &pound;40,000 and specialized in the imported French Peugeot car. Such was his success and prominence that in 1901 Friswell was selected by the Automobile Mutual Protection Association Ltd to fight a test case against H. J. Lawson's monopolistic British Motor Traction Company Ltd. The claim, that Friswell had infringed Maybach's float feed patent by selling a car so fitted, was dismissed and an appeal dropped. By this time he was operating on a large scale: Friswell's Automobile Palace Ltd, a five-storey building, could accommodate hundreds of vehicles in garage and showroom space, with repair and paint shops, accessory sales and auction facilities, and other provisions for the convenience of the clientele.<br>
<br>A logical progression from the motor trade was into manufacturing, and Friswell moved into production after visiting the stand of the Standard Motor Company of Coventry at the Olympia Motor Exhibition in November 1905. He was made sole distributor for Standard cars and became chairman of the Standard Motor Company Ltd (founded 1903), a position he held until November 1912. To strengthen its financial position Friswell organized a guaranteed overdraft with Barclays Bank and the company acquired additional premises, as coachworks and repair and service centres. For nearly six years (four of which are recorded in a volume of detailed board decisions) Friswell dominated the company, both in strategy and in the detail of production. This dominance in production could be construed as undue interference and was probably a major factor contributing to his break from Standard at the end of 1912.<br>
<br>The board decisions show that Friswell was usually present at meetings, unless abroad, and that he was closely involved in detail as well as broad policy, for example in relation to quality control, production, and publicity. The needs of his agency seem to have impeded production runs and his attendance at morning meetings was often followed by a walk around the works before his return to London. Despite this over-close involvement, he was aware of the need to make a formal separation between manufacturer and agent, and decisions affecting his agency were transmitted in writing, even when Friswell was present at the board meeting in question.<br>
<br>In the wider world Friswell put his skill as a publicist to good use. In 1909 he played a prominent part in entertaining delegates to the Imperial Press Conference, attended by newspaper proprietors and editors from across the empire. In recognition for this, and also for his having arranged for hundreds of London's horse-cabmen to be retrained as motor car drivers at his own expense, he was knighted in November 1909. In 1911 his publicity secured for Standard the contract to provide all motor transport, involving some seventy vehicles, for the coronation durbar held in Delhi. During Friswell's absence in India, however, a financial crisis developed at Standard following difficulties in collecting Friswell's account for November 1911. His company subsequently dishonoured its bill for goods supplied in January 1912. Standard survived, but on short time in mid-1912 and Friswell's sole agency agreement was terminated with effect from 30 September. The ending of Friswell's connection with Standard followed soon thereafter, his offer to buy out Reginald Maudslay, founder of Standard, having failed in the face of a successful counter-bid.<br>
<br>In consequence, Friswell left the motor industry; his reconstructed dealership, Friswells Ltd, went into voluntary liquidation in November 1915. Friswell pursued his other business interests, in South Africa and in Sheffield, where he had manufacturing silversmiths works. He died on 15 December 1926 at Eagle House Nursing Home, Woodford Green, Essex. He was survived by his wife.<br>
