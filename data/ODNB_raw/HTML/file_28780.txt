<span class="headword">Warren,  John Byrne Leicester</span>, third Baron de Tabley  (1835&#150;1895), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 26 April 1835 at Tabley House, Knutsford, Cheshire, the eldest son of George Warren, second Baron de Tabley (1811&#150;1887), and Catherina Barbara, daughter of Jerome, Count de Salis-Soglio, by his third wife, Henrietta, daughter of William Foster, bishop of Kilmore. The grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16369/', "John Fleming Leicester, first Baron de Tabley (1762&#150;1827)")</script>, Warren travelled widely with his mother in Italy and Germany during his childhood.<br>
<br>On his return to England, Warren received his education at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford (matriculating on 20 October 1852, and graduating BA in 1859 and MA the next year). While at Oxford he became good friends with a fellow collegian, George Fortescue, whose death by an accident in 1859 had a powerful effect on him. A short time before this event the friends had jointly published a small volume of <span class="italic">Poems</span> under the pseudonym George F. Preston. <span class="italic">Ballads and Metrical Sketches</span> (1860), <span class="italic">The Threshold of Atrides</span> (1861), and <span class="italic">Glimpses of Antiquity</span> (1862) followed under the same pseudonym, but met with no critical success. More power was evinced in <span class="italic">Praeterita</span> (1863), <span class="italic">Eclogues and Monodramas</span> (1864), and <span class="italic">Studies in Verse</span> (1865), all published under the pseudonym William Lancaster. The blank verse poems of which these volumes chiefly consist are Tennysonian in style and substance.<br>
<br>After leaving Oxford, where he gained a second class in classics and history, and a brief interlude of unpaid diplomatic work under Lord Stratford de Redcliffe at Constantinople, Warren was called to the bar from Lincoln's Inn in 1860, but probably never had any serious intention of following the law. In 1856 he became an officer of the Cheshire yeomanry, and in 1868 unsuccessfully contested Mid-Cheshire as a Liberal. On his father's second marriage in 1871, he took up his residence in London.<br>
<br>Warren's <span class="italic">Philoctetes</span>, a tragedy, published anonymously in 1866, was considered by contemporary critics to be the most powerful of his works. It departs from the Greek model in the introduction of a female character and in its pessimism, features which prevented it from being a mere copy of Sophocles. The principal character seems in not a few respects a portrait of the author himself. <span class="italic">Orestes</span>, published anonymously in 1868, attracted little attention. A volume of poems entitled <span class="italic">Rehearsals</span> (1870), the first published under Warren's own name, indicates that the influence of Tennyson, though still strong, was yielding to that of Browning and Swinburne. <span class="italic">The Strange Parable</span>, however, and <span class="italic">Nimrod</span>, both written in blank verse, strike an original note. Another miscellaneous collection, <span class="italic">Searching the Net</span> (1873), is mainly concerned with the description of nature and the expression of subjective feeling. Warren then unfortunately gave his time to the composition of a very long and entirely undramatic tragedy. Not one copy of <span class="italic">The Soldier's Fortune</span> (1876) was sold, and Warren's disappointment paralysed his activity as a poet for a long time. He began to retreat into an increasingly reclusive existence in London, although he retained his regard for many old friends, including Edmund Gosse, Theodore Watts-Dunton, and Sir Mountstuart Grant-Duff.<br>
<br>Warren's pursuits were many and interesting; he was a skilled numismatist, and by 1863 had written an essay on Greek coins as illustrative of Greek federal history. He was also an enthusiastic botanist, which accounts for much of the minute description observable in his poems, and was one of the earliest amateurs of the pursuit of collecting book-plates, on which he produced a standard work, <span class="italic">A Guide to the Study of Book Plates (ex-libris)</span> (1880). His <span class="italic">Flora of Cheshire</span> was prepared from two posthumous manuscripts by Spencer Moore, and was published in 1899 with a prefatory memoir by Sir Mountstuart Grant-Duff. He was also a keen ice-skater.<br>
<br>In 1887 Warren succeeded to the title of Baron de Tabley by the death of his father, and at once found himself immersed in a multitude of business cares which made writing more difficult than ever. An impulse, however, was at hand from an unexpected quarter. In 1891 A. H. Miles published in his <span class="italic">Poets of the Century</span> a selection from de Tabley's poems, with an appreciative criticism. De Tabley was then persuaded by Watts-Dunton and John Lane to republish the best of his poems with additions. The volume, entitled <span class="italic">Poems Dramatic and Lyrical</span> (1893), obtained full public recognition for one who had seemed entirely forgotten. A succeeding volume, issued in 1895, demonstrated that much might still have been expected from the author if his physical powers had not begun to forsake him. His health undermined by an attack of influenza, he died somewhat suddenly on 22 November 1895 at Sandringham House, Ryde, on the Isle of Wight, where he had gone to recuperate. He was buried at St Oswald's churchyard, Little Peover, Cheshire. He was unmarried, and the peerage became extinct; his baronetcy devolved on a distant cousin.<br>
