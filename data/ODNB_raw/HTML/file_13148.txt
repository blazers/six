<span class="headword">Hewitson,  William Chapman</span>  (1806&#150;1878), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born in Percy Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 9 January 1806, the second son of Middleton Hewitson (<i>d</i>. 1845). His early education began at Kirkby Stephen, and was completed at York, where he was articled to John Tuke, a land surveyor. About 1828 or 1829, he returned to Newcastle to pursue his career.<br>
<br>Hewitson was devoted to the study of natural history, a subject for which he had developed a taste during childhood. His friends included a number of like-minded natural history enthusiasts such as the marine zoologist Albany Hancock (and his brother, John), the zoologist Joshua Alder, and the geologist William Hutton. With his fellow students, Hewitson founded a society for the study of natural history (the Natural History Society of Northumberland, Durham and Newcastle upon Tyne), which first met on 19 August 1829. He was a member of the society's committee and honorary curator of its entomological department.<br>
<br>In early life, Hewitson had formed collections of British coleoptera and lepidoptera; he then devoted attention for some years to the study of birds' eggs. In 1831 he began his work <span class="italic">British Oology</span> (1833&#150;42), and in 1832 he undertook a journey to the Shetland Islands, and in 1833 went on an expedition to Norway to discover the breeding places of some migratory species. He was accompanied on this trip by his friends John Hancock and Benjamin Johnson, with the aim of gathering plants, birds, and insects. During their visit to the Arctic circle, they were forced by the harshness of their circumstances, to live on the birds they shot. Hewitson's diary of this expedition was used for pieces on ornithology which appeared in Sir William Jardine's <span class="italic">Magazine of Zoology</span>.<br>
<br>Hewitson moved from Newcastle to Bristol in 1840, where he was employed under George Stephenson on the railway between Bristol and Exeter, as a surveyor. However, by the end of April 1845, two uncles and his father had died, leaving him as their heir, and considerably wealthy. He took up residence at Hampstead, and devoted his life to scientific research, his poor health also playing a role in his decision to give up business.<br>
<br>From about this time, Hewitson's attention became focused again on lepidoptera. He travelled with his friend John Hancock to Switzerland and the Alps, where he gathered a fine series of diurnal lepidoptera. He bought specimens from travellers and naturalists all over the globe, whose expenses he often paid, forming in the process what was probably the most complete collection of diurnal lepidoptera of his time. He published <span class="italic">The Genera of Diurnal Lepidoptera</span> in conjunction with the entomologist Edward Doubleday (1846&#150;52), followed by <span class="italic">Illustrations of Diurnal Lepidoptera</span> (1863&#150;78). He also wrote on the same subject in a number of journals. His other best-known works include the <span class="italic">Illustrations of New Species of Exotic Butterflies</span> (1851&#150;76) and his <span class="italic">Descriptions of some New Species of Lycaenidae</span> (1868). Hewitson was also accomplished as an artist and draughtsman, and as a pictorial describer of butterflies and birds' eggs, he was considered unrivalled.<br>
<br>About 1848 Hewitson married, but his wife died soon after. They had no children. In the same year he purchased part of Oatlands Park, Surrey, where he lived for thirty years, in a house designed for him by the architect John Dobson. Having joined the Entomological Society in 1846, he also became a member of the Zoological Society (1859) and the Linnean Society (1862).<br>
<br>When Hewitson died on 28 May 1878 at Oatlands, there was no heir to his fortune. He made a bequest of &pound;10,000 to the Newcastle Infirmary, and left his library of works on natural history, with a legacy of &pound;3000, to the Natural History Society of Northumberland, Durham and Newcastle. He also left a large sum to the M&uuml;ller Institute, Bristol. The rest of his fortune he bequeathed to various charities, and &pound;20,000 in legacies was divided among fifty-eight of his friends. His estate at Oatlands was bequeathed to his closest friend, John Hancock, while to the British Museum was left his butterfly collection, some pictures, and watercolours, in addition to his stuffed birds. He was buried at Walton-on-Thames.<br>
