</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lofft,  Capel</span>  (1751&#150;1824), <span class="occ">radical editor and writer</span>, was born on 14 November 1751 in London, the only son of Christopher Lofft, a former private secretary to Sarah, duchess of Marlborough, and his wife, Anne Capell, who was the sister of the Shakespearian scholar Edward Capell. He was educated at Eton College from 1759 to 1769, when he matriculated from Peterhouse, Cambridge. He did not take a degree and in 1770 was admitted to Lincoln's Inn, whence he was called to the bar in 1775. At Peterhouse, the college of John Jebb and John Disney, he encountered a spirit of theological heterodoxy which influenced him for the rest of his life. He did not acquire a large legal practice, but in 1776 edited a compilation of reports of cases in king's bench, including several decisions of Lord Mansfield which were not recorded elsewhere. Lofft's report of Mansfield's crucial decision in the case of James Somerset&#151;that the laws of England did not recognize slavery&#151;allowed the nascent anti-slavery movement to derive a considerable political advantage. Thereafter Lofft was associated with movements for constitutional, legal, and religious reform. He was a strong critic of the British government's attempt to re-assert control over the North American colonies by force.<br>
<br>In 1778 Lofft married, as his first wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1801), daughter of the architect <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8791/', "Henry Emlyn")</script>; they had three children, of whom the second, Robert Emlyn Lofft (<i>d</i>. 1847), became an officer in the Bengal army. In 1781 Lofft inherited from his uncle Edward Capell substantial estates at Troston and Stanton in Suffolk, and for many years Troston Hall was his principal residence. He was now able to live independently of any profession; he became a prominent figure in Suffolk society, serving as a magistrate, and devoted his energy to writing and campaigns for reform. He was a founder member of the Society for Constitutional Information in 1780, organized a reform petition from Bury St Edmunds in 1783, and wrote many articles in favour of reform for the <span class="italic">Bury Journal</span>. James Boswell, who met Lofft in 1784 in company which included Dr Johnson, described him as &#145;a most zealous Whig&#146;, with &#145;a mind &hellip; full of learning and knowledge&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 4.258). Lofft indeed became something of a polymath, with a serious interest in English literature, history, classics, foreign languages, botany, and astronomy. He represented the best of the amateur tradition in learning, exemplified by the financially independent country gentleman.<br>
<br>Although brought up in the Church of England, by the 1780s Lofft had come to embrace Unitarian doctrines. In a letter to Joseph Parker in 1790 he described himself &#145;not as a Member of the Establishment but as a Dissenter so far removed from it as to be out of the Protection of the <span class="roman">Act of Toleration</span>&#146;  (&#145;Letters and remains of Capel Lofft&#146;). He gave strong support to the campaign for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span> in 1787&#150;90, contributing a <span class="italic">History of the Corporation and Test Acts</span> (1790), which included a valuable list of the minority of MPs who had voted for repeal on 8 May 1789. He remained convinced of the need for complete civil equality for protestant dissenters, but, as he told his fellow reformer Christopher Wyvill in 1809: &#145;I must acknowledge I scarcely can expect religious Freedom to come but as a consequence of a Reform in the Election &amp; Duration of Parliament&#146;  (N. Yorks. CRO, Wyvill of Constable Burton MSS, ZFW 7/2/210/13).<br>
<br>During the 1790s Lofft vehemently opposed the ministry of the younger Pitt, especially in its war and taxation policies. He moved towards the more radical wing of the reform movement, arguing for the Society for Constitutional Information's programme of universal male suffrage and urging Wyvill himself to adopt a more radical approach. He used his influence in Suffolk in this cause, addressing several public meetings, and in 1800 his name was removed from the list of magistrates when he publicly opposed the imposition of the death penalty upon a young girl  (<span class="italic">The New Suffolk Garland</span>, 52&#150;4). A few years later he joined the Society for the Diffusion of Knowledge upon the Punishment of Death, which campaigned against capital punishment.<br>
<br>Anne Lofft died in 1801. On 10 March 1802 at St Benedict's, Cambridge, Lofft married, as his second wife, Sarah Watson (1780&#150;1855), daughter of Joseph Finch of Cambridge. She was an author and poet in her own right. They had a son and two daughters; the son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16931/', "Capell Lofft (1806&#150;1873)")</script>, became a miscellaneous writer of some note. Lofft himself maintained a high literary output, which included editions of Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> (1792) and of Virgil's <span class="italic">Georgics</span> (1803), together with a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">On the Revival of the Cause of Reform in the Representation of the Commons in Parliament</span> (1809) and a collection of Shakespearian aphorisms (1812). He was the patron of the poet Robert Bloomfield, to whose <span class="italic">Farmer's Boy</span> he contributed a preface (1798). During the Regency period he maintained his radical political opinions; his closest associates were literary figures&#151;S. T. Coleridge, W. Hazlitt, H. Crabb Robinson&#151;who were also critics of the regime. Like Hazlitt, Lofft was a warm admirer of Napoleon Bonaparte. While remaining committed to strictly constitutional methods of proceeding, he refused to be deflected by a fear of popular pressure. As he told Wyvill in 1809: &#145;No violence, even of Mr Cobbett, shall make me other than a Friend to right Principles whencesoever they come&#146;  (N. Yorks. CRO, Wyvill of Constable Burton MSS, ZFW 7/2/208/48). In 1818 he embarked on a continental tour before settling at Turin four years later. Early in 1824 he moved to nearby Moncalieri, where he died on 26 May of the same year. He was buried in the protestant church of St Germain, Piedmont, and was survived by his wife, who died on 11 July 1855.<br>
<br>In its obituary the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> offered a description of Lofft's appearance: &#145;His figure was small, upright, and boyish; his dress&#151;without fit, fashion or neatness; his speaking&#151;small-voiced, long sentenced, and involved; his manner&#151;persevering, but without command&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 94/2, 1824, 184). His rather dishevelled person is captured, probably accurately, in S. Knight's cartoon <span class="italic">A View Near Bury&#150;Suffolk</span>. He was a perfect example of a Cambridge-educated whig, brought up in a tradition of Anglican latitudinarianism and subsequently a Unitarian. He expressed a vigorously libertarian mentality, while not challenging the fundamental property relationships of the society within which he occupied an eminent position. According to Wyvill, he &#145;knew how to temper the ardour of his zeal with candour, moderation, and the most conciliatory prudence&#146;  (Wyvill, <span class="italic">Political Papers</span>, 5.88 n.). His energy was distributed over too many areas of interest for him to become an outstanding expert upon any particular subject, but he none the less established a secure niche within the second rank of literary and political figures of his age.<br>
