<span class="headword">Denewulf</span>  (<em>d.</em> 908), <span class="occ">bishop of Winchester</span>, has a bad reputation which does not seem to have been fully deserved. In the period of the tenth-century reformation he was castigated for allowing estates belonging to his cathedral (Old Minster) in Winchester to fall into lay hands. His denigration in Winchester tradition is epitomized by the legend, reported by William of Malmesbury, that he was in origin a swineherd whom Alfred had met in a wood while on the run from the vikings. It is true that a number of Winchester estates were either leased to laymen or lost during Denewulf's episcopate (878/9&#150;908), but it would appear that Denewulf had little choice in the matter and that considerable pressure was placed on him by Alfred and his son and successor, Edward the Elder, to surrender estates to them. When King Edward compelled the community at Old Minster to lease him an estate at Beddington (Surrey), the bishop felt obliged to request that &#145;you desire no more land of that foundation for it seems to them an unwelcome demand; so that God need blame neither you nor us for the diminishing in our days&#146;  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1444).<br>
<br>Even when Winchester had a seemingly inviolate claim to an estate, the kings could drive a hard bargain. Before Denewulf's episcopacy an estate belonging to Old Minster at Alresford had been leased to the family of a nobleman called Alfred. In the reign of King Alfred this nobleman was found guilty of adultery and his possessions were forfeit to the crown. In spite of Old Minster's prior claim, Denewulf was able to recover Alresford from the king only by payment of the very substantial sum of 120 mancuses of gold. The bishop was also unsuccessful in obtaining lands left to Old Minster in the will of King &AElig;thelwulf, in spite of surrendering another large estate to Alfred to secure the reversion. King Edward subsequently used one of the reversionary estates to endow his foundation of New Minster in Winchester and Old Minster had to take a rather smaller estate instead. Land in Winchester also had to be sold to the king for the new foundation, which was built immediately adjacent to the Old Minster church. However, Denewulf was not always so unfortunate in his dealings with the royal house. An exchange with the king of the episcopal estate at Portchester (probably desired by the king for its defensive potential) for the former monastic site at Bishop's Waltham was a transfer of estates of very similar size and Denewulf received the gift of an estate at Ruishton (Somerset) from King Alfred with no apparent strings attached.<br>
<br>Of Denewulf's other activities as bishop little is known. He was presumably meant to be included in Alfred's criticisms of his bishops in the preface of his translation to Pope Gregory's <span class="italic">Pastoral Care</span>, and the absence of any specific benefaction to Denewulf or Winchester in Alfred's will could be seen as another indication that Denewulf was not closely involved with Alfred's reforming policies. The <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> records his death in 908; he presumably died and was buried at Winchester.<br>
