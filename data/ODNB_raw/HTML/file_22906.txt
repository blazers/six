<span class="headword">Purver,  Anthony</span>  (1702&#150;1777), <span class="occ">biblical translator and Quaker preacher</span>, was the son of a farmer at Hurstbourne Tarrant, Hampshire. He was a promising pupil at the village school. While apprenticed to a shoemaker, he read <span class="italic">Rusticus ad academicos</span> by the Quaker Samuel Fisher. Fisher's argument that scripture is &#145;corrupted, vitiated, altered and adulterated in all translations&#146;  (S. Fisher, <span class="italic">Rusticus ad academicos</span>, 1660, fol. A4<i>v</i>), contributed to Purver's belief &#145;that he was called and commanded&#146; by the divine spirit to translate the scriptures  (Coleridge, 717). At twenty he opened a school. Three or four years later he went to London. He became a Quaker, and preached at meetings in London, Essex, and elsewhere. John Wesley, who met him several times in 1739, described him as &#145;one of much experience in the ways of God&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Wesley</span>, 25.637). About 1739 he married Rachell Cotterel, mistress of a girls' boarding-school at Frenchay, Bristol. There he lived, taught, and was clerk to the meeting until returning to Hampshire in 1758. Besides his <span class="roman">Bible</span>, he published <span class="italic">Youth's Delight</span> (1727), a popular verse broadside, <span class="italic">Counsel to Friends' Children</span> (6th edn, 1785), and <span class="italic">Poem to the Praise of God</span> (1748).<br>
<br>Purver studied Hebrew during his apprenticeship, and also learnt Aramaic, Syriac, Greek, and Latin. He read voluminously in biblical criticism (including rabbinic commentary), in the earlier English translations and in literature. All this finds its way into his translation and the accompanying notes. He began the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> about 1733, often shutting himself up for days seeking inspiration for difficult passages. About 1742, when &#145;Ester&#146;, &#145;the Poem of Solomon&#146; and some of the minor prophets were complete, the Bristol printer, Felix Farley, issued the work in parts as <span class="italic">Opus in sacra Biblia elaboratum</span>. Dr John Fothergill recommended it in an advertisement in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1746), but the venture was unsuccessful and only a few numbers appeared. Wesley was much disappointed in his &#145;old friend's&#146; work, finding &#145;the text flat and dead&#151;much altered indeed, but commonly for the worse&#151;and the notes merely critical, dull, and dry, without any unction, or spirit, or life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Wesley</span>, 20.81&#150;2). In 1763 the work, including important &#145;introductory remarks&#146; and appendices criticizing the scholarship and English of the King James <span class="roman">Bible</span>, was complete. Fothergill paid Purver &pound;1000 for the copyright and published it at his own expense as <span class="italic">A new and literal translation of all the books of the Old and New Testament; with notes, critical and explanatory</span> (2 vols., 1764).<br>
<br>In its renderings and its language, the &#145;Quaker's <span class="roman">Bible</span>&#146; sometimes anticipates later versions, but it was rarely appreciated. Not only was the language constantly unlike that of the King James <span class="roman">Bible</span> but it was often decidedly colloquial. However, the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> did note &#145;no small share of erudition. This is a work to which we should have thought very few individuals equal, however great and extensive their abilities; and we cannot help admiring the man who hath intrepidity enough to attempt it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 1st ser., 32, 1765, 194).<br>
<br>Purver died at Andover in July 1777, and is buried in the Quaker burial-ground there.<br>
