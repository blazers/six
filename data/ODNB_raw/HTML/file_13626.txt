<span class="headword">Holyman,  John</span>  (1495&#150;1558), <span class="occ">bishop of Bristol</span>, was a native of Cuddington, near Haddenham in Buckinghamshire. He was admitted a scholar at Winchester College in 1506, aged eleven, and then went to New College, Oxford, where, in 1512, he became a fellow. He graduated BA in 1514, MA in 1518, and BTh in 1526. He left his college about 1526, and became rector of Colerne, Wiltshire, but for the sake of books and literary society settled in Exeter College, Oxford, where he was charged for the rent of a room in 1525&#150;6 and 1534&#150;5. There he soon acquired a great reputation for learning and sanctity, and was university preacher on Easter day in both 1527 and 1530. In 1530 he took the degree of DTh. A letter of December that year from Hugh Farindon, abbot of St Mary's, Reading, in support of Holyman's supplication that a sermon preached by him at Paul's Cross, London, might count in place of a statutory sermon preached in St Mary's, Oxford, was misunderstood by Anthony Wood as suggesting that Holyman had become a monk of that abbey. He opposed the divorce of Henry VIII from Queen Catherine, advocating the validity of their marriage by writing and preaching and being described as &#145;an enemy to the King's cause&#146; in a letter of Richard Croke to Thomas Cromwell of 26 January 1534  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 7, no. 101). He was obliged in consequence to remove to Handborough, near Woodstock, of which he was rector, living partly there and partly in Exeter College. He became vicar of Wing, Buckinghamshire, on 3 May 1546.<br>
<br>Following Mary's accession Holyman was promoted to the bishopric of Bristol, and was consecrated in the chapel of the bishop of London on 18 November 1554. The temporalities were restored ten days later. Little is known of his episcopate, from which no register survives, but Holyman, who was firmly committed to the Catholic cause, appears to have been a satisfactory bishop. He was included with John White and James Brooks in a commission to try Ridley and Latimer for heresy, and took part at Oxford in the disputation with Cranmer (1554) and in the trial of Bishop Hooper. He appears to have shown no great zeal for prosecuting heretics, and few burnings took place in his diocese. He is not mentioned by Foxe as present when William Dalby, his chancellor, sent three men to the stake at Bristol for their religious beliefs. Anthony Wood attributes a number of works to him, including &#145;Tractatus contra doctrinam M. Lutheri&#146; and &#145;Defensio matrimonii Reginae Catharinae cum Rege Henrico octavo&#146;. These are not known to have survived.<br>
<br>Holyman died on 20 December 1558 and was buried not in his cathedral but in the chancel of Handborough church. By his will, dated 4 June 1558, and proved on 16 February 1559, he bequeathed &pound;20 to New College, Oxford, and to Winchester College the writings of St Augustine, St Jerome, St Cyprian, and other works of church history, which were afterwards chained in the library.<br>
