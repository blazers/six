<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mantell,  Gideon Algernon</span>  (1790&#150;1852), <span class="occ">surgeon and geologist</span>, was born on 3 February 1790 at his family's home in St Mary's Lane, Lewes, Sussex, a middle child among the eight of Thomas Mantell (1750&#150;1807), a shoemaker, and his wife, Sarah Austen (1755&#150;1828), originally from Kent. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18005/', "Joshua Mantell")</script> was a younger brother. Precluded from attending grammar school and the universities by his father's well-known political and religious views (radical whig and Methodist, respectively), he was educated by John Button in Lewes and by his uncle George Mantell in Wiltshire. In 1805 he was apprenticed in Lewes to James Moore, a surgeon, with whom (following six months at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London) he entered into partnership. In 1816 Mantell married Mary Ann Woodhouse (1795&#150;1869) of Maida Hill, London, the daughter of one of his first patients, and further established himself in Lewes, eventually buying out his partner, Moore. The four surviving children of his marriage were Ellen Maria (1818&#150;1892?), who married John W. Parker, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53960/', "Walter Baldock Durrant Mantell (1820&#150;1895)")</script>, Hannah Matilda (1822&#150;1840), who died unmarried, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53961/', "Reginald Neville Mantell (1827&#150;1857)")</script>.<br>
<br>Although Mantell contributed several medical publications to <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> and other journals, he is notable primarily for his work in geology and palaeontology, fields that had attracted him in childhood. This work earned him the nickname &#145;Wizard of the Weald&#146;. His assiduous investigations of the strata and invertebrate fossils of eastern Sussex culminated in <span class="italic">The Fossils of the South Downs</span> (1822), his first book (of twelve), with lithography by his wife. Having by then explored the rich vertebrate deposits of Tilgate Forest (near Cuckfield), he announced in February 1825 the discovery of <i>Iguanodon</i>, one of the various kinds of dinosaurs (not yet so called) with which he was subsequently associated. Although his earliest evidence consisted of teeth only, these were sufficient to establish the, at the time unique, identity of <i>Iguanodon</i> as an extinct gigantic herbivorous reptile and to secure for Mantell entry into the Royal Society. He had been admitted to the Geological Society of London as early as 1818 and in 1835 became the second recipient (after William Smith) of its Wollaston medal on the basis of his saurian discoveries.<br>
<br>In 1827 Mantell published <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Geology of Sussex</span>, which was devoted to the vertebrate fossils of Tilgate Forest and is the earliest book of any to deal primarily with dinosaur remains. His <span class="italic">Geology of the South-East of England</span> (1833) then combined text from his books of 1822 and 1827 with a Geological Society paper in which he announced his discovery of a second kind of dinosaur, <i>Hylaeosaurus</i>. Heavily armoured, <i>Hylaeosaurus</i> confirmed that dinosaurs walked on solid ground and were not amphibian, as had earlier been thought.<br>
<br>Mantell's discoveries, honours, and books, together with a private geological museum he had established, brought him much-sought-after recognition, and even friends among the aristocracy, his lowly social origins notwithstanding. His lifelong hunger for respectability, whetted by a generous grant of &pound;1000 from the very rich third earl of Egremont, led Mantell to abandon Lewes for nearby Brighton, which the king and his retinue visited every winter. Mantell failed to achieve a viable medical practice there but by expanding and eventually institutionalizing his geological museum, he became the local leader of scientific and other learned endeavour. In 1834 his American correspondent Benjamin Silliman of Yale (whom he was not to meet until 1851) secured for Mantell an honorary LLD. On the strength of this blatantly solicited honour, Mantell chose ever after to be known as Dr Mantell, though his distinction was literary rather than medical.<br>
<br>It was also in 1834 that Mantell acquired his most famous specimen, the Maidstone <i>Iguanodon</i>, which was bought for him from its discoverer by friends. As one of the two most nearly complete dinosaur fossils then known (his <i>Hylaeosaurus</i> being the other), it considerably increased available knowledge and became the chief attraction of his museum. Forced by economic necessity to buy a medical practice (in Clapham Common), and needing money, Mantell sold his fossils to the British Museum in 1838 for &pound;4000. His wife and elder son left him the next year and his favourite daughter, Hannah Matilda, died of tuberculosis in 1840.<br>
<br>After months of despair over his quadruple loss, Mantell recovered his tenacity of spirit and began a decade of remarkable creativity, during much of which he was assisted by his remaining daughter, Ellen Maria, who contributed drawings by herself to several of his books, including the very popular <span class="italic">Wonders of Geology</span> (1838), <span class="italic">Medals of Creation</span> (1844, opposing evolution), and <span class="italic">Thoughts on Animalcules</span> (1846, on microscopy). His last books on geology, <span class="italic">A Pictorial Atlas of Fossil Remains</span> (1850) and <span class="italic">Petrifactions and their Teachings</span> (1851), include contributions on rare or recently extinct New Zealand birds by his son Walter.<br>
<br>The word &#145;dinosaur&#146; was coined only in 1842 by Richard Owen, a brilliant but unscrupulous comparative anatomist whose envy of Mantell's original discoveries spoiled what should have been a congenial relationship between them. It was Mantell, not Owen, who first emphasized (in 1831) what Cuvier had affirmed earlier&#151;that there had been an age of reptiles preceding the age of mammals. Besides <i>Iguanodon</i> and <i>Hylaeosaurus</i>, Mantell's dinosaur finds included <i>Megalosaurus</i>, <i>Cetiosaurus</i>, <i>Regnosaurus</i>, <i>Pelorosaurus</i>, and the later-named <i>Hypsilophodon</i>. He also discovered dozens of other prehistoric creatures: new fossil fishes, further vertebrates, and a very large number of invertebrates, together with microspecies and plants.<br>
<br>By the end of his remarkable career (blighted from 1841 on by a painful spinal condition), Mantell had won the royal medal of the Royal Society (1849) and numerous domestic and foreign honours. He contributed importantly to stratigraphy, palaeontology, evolutionary biology, ornithology, microscopy, archaeology, and local history; his medical knowledge and astute detective work once saved the life of a local woman, Hannah Russell, who had been falsely accused of poisoning her husband. Though a popular writer and lecturer, most of his publications were specialized, highly technical papers for either the Geological Society or the Royal Society. Mantell died in bed at his final home, 19 Chester Square, London, on 10 November 1852, possibly from an overdose of opium taken to assuage his continual spinal pain. He was buried four days later in Norwood cemetery beside his favourite daughter, Hannah Matilda, the only member of his immediate family who (in his eyes) never rejected him.<br>
