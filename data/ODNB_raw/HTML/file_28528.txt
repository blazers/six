<span class="headword">Wall,  Richard</span>  (1694&#150;1778), <span class="occ">politician and diplomatist for Spain</span>, was born in 1694, probably at Coolnamuck, co. Waterford, Ireland, where a branch of that family was settled. He is first heard of in 1718, when he served as a volunteer in the Spanish fleet which was defeated off Sicily by George Byng, Viscount Torrington. In 1727, as a captain of dragoons, he went to St Petersburg as secretary with the duke of Liria, the eldest son of the duke of Berwick and grandson of James II, who had been appointed Spanish ambassador to that city. They had an interview on their way with the Old Pretender at Bologna, and halted also at Vienna, Dresden, and Berlin. Despite the trust placed in him by Liria, Wall returned to Spain prematurely, apparently suffering from depression.<br>
<br>After rejoining the Spanish army, Wall served under Don Philip in Lombardy and under Montemar in Naples, and was next dispatched to the West Indies, where he conceived a plan for recovering Jamaica. In 1747 he was sent to Aix-la-Chapelle and London to negotiate peace, returned to Spain by way of France in February 1748 to report progress, and on the conclusion of the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in October 1748 he was formally appointed to the London embassy. Wall's priorities in Britain were to obtain diplomatic concessions for Spanish commerce while simultaneously using espionage to further Spain's economic recovery. Attempts were made, with limited success, to smuggle skilled men and equipment from Britain to Spain's dockyards and woollen industry. Wall, in conjunction with the Spanish secretary of state Carvajal in Madrid, successfully ended the <i>asiento</i>, obtained by Britain for forty years in 1713 and interrupted by war, by which she had won the right to import Africans as slave labour into Spanish America. Unfortunately they had to cede Britain other trade concessions in return.<br>
<br>In 1752 Wall was appointed lieutenant-general and in October of the same year was briefly recalled on account of his services being required at Madrid in settling commercial arrangements with the English ambassador, Sir Benjamin Keene. Although he had occasional differences with Keene and his successor, Lord Bristol, Wall was regarded as the head of the English party, and the French intrigued against him. He was finally recalled in April 1754, following Carvajal's death, when he succeeded the latter as foreign minister. He was reluctant to leave England, where he was very popular and had made the acquaintance of the elder Pitt and many others. That autumn, supplanting Ensenada, Wall became secretary of state. His administration was compromised by internal conflicts revolving around centralizing policies, such as the campaign against the Jesuits, and the aristocratic conservatism of his courtier colleagues.<br>
<br>Wall had reached an understanding with the queen dowager, Elizabeth Farnese, and enjoyed enduring good relations with her son the king of Naples. Nevertheless, when on the death of Ferdinand VI in 1759 the king of Naples acceded to the Spanish throne as Charles III, Wall began to be eclipsed in Madrid. The king preferred a more belligerent foreign policy, leading to an alliance with France and the other Bourbon states in December 1761 and entry into the war with Britain. Wall's handling of the conflict was half-hearted and of mixed success, and after many attempts he was allowed to resign in August 1763. Some of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s remained in office, and Charles III continued to consult him on some matters. Among his labours in office had been the restoration of the Alhambra, which he incongruously roofed with red tiles.<br>
<br>On his retirement, Wall received a pension of 100,000 crowns, the full pay of a lieutenant-general, and the possession for life of the Soto di Roma, a royal hunting seat near Granada, later presented to the duke of Wellington. This he decorated with English furniture. He also drained its 4000 acres of fields and woods, made new drives, and improved the economic condition of his tenants. He resided there from October to May, attended the court at Aranjuez for a month, and spent the summer at Mirador, a villa near Granada. Henry Swinburne (1743&#150;1803) visited him at Soto di Roma in 1776, and was delighted with his sprightly conversation, for which he had always been noted. He died in 1778.<br>
