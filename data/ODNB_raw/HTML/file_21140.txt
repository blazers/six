<span class="headword">Pakenham, Sir  Richard</span>  (1797&#150;1868), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 19 May 1797 at Pakenham Hall, Castlepollard, co. Westmeath, Ireland, the fifth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21141/', "Admiral Sir Thomas Pakenham (1757&#150;1836)")</script> and his wife, Louisa, daughter of the Rt Hon. John Staples. He was a cousin of General Sir Edward Pakenham (1778&#150;1815), who was killed at the battle of New Orleans in 1815. After attending Trinity College, Dublin, Pakenham began his diplomatic career on 15 October 1817, as attach&eacute; to his uncle the earl of Clancarty, at The Hague. On 26 January 1824 he was assigned to Switzerland as secretary of legation. He was promoted and transferred on 29 December 1826 to Mexico, where he spent the next sixteen years of his life, first as secretary of legation and then from 12 March 1835 as minister-plenipotentiary. He was a friend of Sir Charles Vaughan (1774&#150;1849), minister to the United States from 1827 to 1835, with whom he corresponded while in Mexico. Pakenham never married, although it was said he had been engaged intermittently to Luz Escand&oacute;n, sister of Manuel Escand&oacute;n, a prominent Mexican businessman.<br>
<br>Pakenham was a very astute and effective diplomat, dealing mainly with the commercial and financial questions that formed the basis of Britain's connection with Mexico at a time of great political instability caused by years of revolutionary upheaval. He spoke perfect Spanish, often wore Mexican dress, and by contemporary accounts was well liked and respected by government, diplomatic, and commercial &eacute;lites in Mexico. He was instrumental behind the scenes in effecting a settlement between France and Mexico in 1839 after the French attack on Vera Cruz (1838) over claims against the Mexican government. Less successful was the attempt to mediate a settlement between Mexico and Texas, who were at war after 1836, when Texas overthrew Mexican rule and established an independent republic. The Texas question preoccupied Pakenham for the remainder of his stay in Mexico, which lasted until 1842, when he took a leave of absence in England. On 13 December 1843 he was sworn of the privy council, and the next day he was appointed envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary to the United States.<br>
<br>Two important issues were pending upon Pakenham's arrival in Washington on 13 February 1844: the annexation of Texas and the Oregon boundary dispute. The former question was especially delicate, as the American secretary of state, John C. Calhoun, accused Britain of having promoted the abolition of slavery in Texas to undermine the institution in the United States. The two exchanged diplomatic notes on the subject, later known as the Calhoun&#150;Pakenham correspondence. Although the correspondence is better known for Calhoun's defence of slavery, Pakenham's deliberate avoidance of a continuing debate on Britain's official anti-slavery position enabled him to defuse the attacks against Britain during the annexation crisis.<br>
<br>More threatening to the Anglo-American peace, however, was the Oregon boundary crisis resolved in 1846, during which Pakenham suffered a profound crisis of confidence in his diplomatic abilities. He received a reprimand from Lord Aberdeen, the foreign secretary, for having rejected outright an American counterproposal and thereby precipitated a temporary suspension of the negotiations. Pakenham asked to be recalled over the incident since &#145;the little confidence that I ever possessed in my own judgment is now so completely shattered that I shall no longer be able to proceed&#146;  (Pakenham to Aberdeen, 28 Oct 1845, BL, Add. MS 43123). Aberdeen reassured him and the crisis ended peacefully, but Pakenham felt that the American government mistreated him. He wrote of James Buchanan, Calhoun's successor, &#145;if you knew what it was to be pitied by such a man as Mr. Buchanan, you would understand that I could not but take the thing [the Oregon negotiations] a little to heart&#146;  (Pakenham to Aberdeen, 29 Dec 1845, BL, Add. MS 43123).<br>
<br>Pakenham returned to Britain on leave in May 1847 and, rather than return to his post in the United States, took an early retirement. He was made KCB in 1848. The Foreign Office asked him to resume his career however, and on 28 April 1851 he was assigned to Lisbon as envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary. In May 1855 he returned to Britain on leave and on 28 June he retired on pension. His last assignment was a brief special mission to Lisbon from August to October 1855. He was awarded a diplomatic pension of the second class and retired to his family home at Castlepollard, co. Westmeath. He died at Coolure, near Castlepollard, during the last week of October 1868: there is uncertainty over the precise date, but 28 October seems most likely.<br>
