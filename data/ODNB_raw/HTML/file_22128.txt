<span class="headword">Philips,  Peter</span>  (1560/61&#150;1628), <span class="occ">musician and composer</span>, was born of unknown parents. He was brought up by the noted Roman Catholic recusant <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70101/', "Sebastian Westcote (c.1515&#150;1582)")</script>, almoner and choirmaster of St Paul's Cathedral: Philips was a chorister there, and was eventually a beneficiary of Westcote's will, dated 3 April 1582. Philips's first dated piece is the <span class="italic">Pavana</span> of 1580, which is marked &#145;the first [that] ever Phi[lips] mad[e]&#146;; it became extremely well known, and was much copied and arranged all over Europe.<h2>
<a name="Earlytravels"></a>Early travels</h2>Philips left England for ever early in August 1582 &#145;por la foy Catholique&#146; and &#145;to live after his conscience and to sie Italie where he had harde that there were excellent men of his facultie&#146;, as he later pointed out during his trial at The Hague. He went first to the English College at Douai, staying for a short time from 18 August onwards, and arrived in Rome in October 1582, being admitted to the Jesuit English College on 20 October. He entered the service of Cardinal Farnese, and became organist of the English College, spending three years in Rome. Its music&#151;Marenzio, Palestrina, Felice Anerio (whom he possibly knew), and Victoria were active there&#151;had a lasting effect on his vocal (though not on his instrumental) style. Here in 1585 he met Thomas Paget, third Baron Paget, and entered his service as a musician, travelling with him to Spain via Genoa (October 1585) and France (where he arrived in 1586). He was in Paris for most of 1587 and the first half of 1588, though he made a short trip to Brussels about March 1588, probably in connection with Paget's younger brother Charles Paget's move from Paris to Brussels. Philips seems to have been an eyewitness in Paris when Henri III fled to Chartres at the building of barricades by demonstrators on 12 May 1588.<br>
<br>Philips left Paris with Lord Paget for the Low Countries in the middle of 1588. Paget died in 1590 (Philips's <span class="italic">Pavana &amp; galliarda Pagett</span> probably commemorates him), and Philips, left without a patron, went to Antwerp. There he married that year (his wife's name is unknown) and made a living by teaching children to play the virginals, also acting as a music editor for the publishing house of Pierre Phal&egrave;se. His first publication, <span class="italic">Melodia Olympica</span> (1591), was a compilation of madrigals by many composers including himself: the music was chosen so as to avoid the outrageously chromatic, dissonant, or virtuoso. From then on Philips had close ties with Phal&egrave;se, whose firm issued all his remaining volumes except for <span class="italic">Les rossignols spirituels</span>. His consort music and keyboard music, more English in style, remained in manuscript; it was his (published) vocal music that formed the heart of his output. Nevertheless, the instrumental music in BL, Egerton MS 3665 indicates that he was associated with an instrumental ensemble, perhaps at the Brussels court.<h2>
<a name="Arrestandtrial"></a>Arrest and trial</h2>Philips went to Amsterdam in 1593, as he later claimed, &#145;to sie and heare an excellent man of his faculties&#146; (probably Sweelinck, whom he is known to have admired). On his way home he fell ill, and decided to break his journey at Middelburg. Here he was arrested, taken to The Hague, and imprisoned on a charge of high treason. He was accused of taking part in the burning of an effigy of Elizabeth I at the time when the barricades were put up in Paris. The association with Charles Paget, a notable and dangerous double agent, had aroused suspicions which it took some time to allay; such associations were particularly suspect in the years following the Spanish Armada. After a lengthy exchange of letters between the northern states of the Netherlands and England, and a deposition from Philips himself (the document in which he tells us much about his early life), the charge was dismissed and he was released late in October 1594. His long stay in prison produced the keyboard <span class="italic">Pavana &amp; galiarda doloroso. Treg[ian]</span> &#145;composta in prigione&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Madrigals"></a>Madrigals</h2>Philips's <span class="italic">Il primo libro de madrigali a sei voci</span> was published in 1596. A daughter, Marie, who eventually became a Benedictine nun, was probably born in the same year, but Philips's wife seems to have died before 1597. In that year the composer went to Brussels, where his certificate of residence that year states him to have been thirty-six. In Brussels he entered the service of the Archduke Albert, who ruled the Low Countries for Spain; Philips retained the post of court organist until his death thirty-one years later. There was a regular choir in the court chapel, and the organists employed made it one of the most musically outstanding in Europe. <span class="italic">Madrigali a otto voci</span> was published in 1598; the fact that it was reissued in 1599 and 1615 makes it his most successful book of madrigals. The dedication was to William Stanley, described by Philips as &#145;Collonello d'un Regimento Inglesi &amp; Walloni&#146;; the dedication to a man whose efforts were put to the service of Spain against England and the United Provinces is a fair indicator of the strength of Philips's Roman Catholic allegiance. Thomas Morley published a madrigal by Philips (&#145;The Nightingale&#146;, a setting of a sonnet by Petrarch which has not survived in its presumed original form of &#145;Quel rosignuol&#146;) in his <span class="italic">Madrigals to Five Voyces. Celected out of the Best Approved Italian Authors</span> in London in 1598. Even at this early stage Philips was acknowledged as something other than an English composer, and was ranked along with the greatest Italians.<br>
<br>In 1599 Albert brought his bride, Isabella, to Brussels (they had been married by proxy at Ferrara in November 1598), and Philips took part in the splendid celebrations. To judge from the texts his six-voice madrigal &#145;Qui sott' ombrosi&#146; and the eight-voice motets <span class="italic">Ecce tu pulchra es</span> and <span class="italic">Quae est ista</span> were written for and performed at these celebrations. The first of these was later included in <span class="italic">Il secondo libro de madrigali a sei voci</span> (1603); the dedication, appropriately enough, was to the archdukes Albert and Isabella (as they liked to be known). This was Philips's last book of madrigals: from this point onwards his publications were entirely of church music, as was the case with the late output of many other composers whose lives were bound up with the Counter-Reformation (and with the Jesuits in particular). The 1603 volume came just after a terrible outbreak of plague in the Netherlands, and it is possible that Philips's five-voice <span class="italic">Media vita</span> was written at this time.<h2>
<a name="Churchandcourtservice"></a>Church and court service</h2>It has been customary to suggest that the nine years between the publication of <span class="italic">Il secondo libro de madrigali a sei voci</span> and the next publication, the <span class="italic">Cantiones sacrae &hellip; quinis vocibus</span>, were those in which Philips undertook theological studies and entered the priesthood. In fact, in spite of the title &#145;Canon&#146; which appears alongside the composer's name in nearly all his publications after 1612, he was never a priest, but was given the title so that he might draw part of his salary from the church, so short of money was the Brussels court during the prolonged war against the protestant northern provinces. His first canonry was at St Vincent in Soignies; he took it up on 9 March 1610, and it must have been purely nominal. It is more likely that these barren years saw the preparation of his first three volumes of church music, which were to appear in 1612&#150;13.<br>
<br>In 1611 Philips, with other members of the court chapel, went to Mechelen to inaugurate a new organ in the church of St Rombault; the accounts suggest that Philips played the new instrument at the solemn Easter procession. In the same year Philips was present at the funeral of the Archduchess Mary of Austria, which took place in Brussels on 12 and 13 December.<h2>
<a name="Churchmusic"></a>Church music</h2>Philips's first volume of church music, <span class="italic">Cantiones sacrae &hellip; quinis vocibus</span>, was published in 1612 when he had just entered his fifties. Although it is conservative in style it is one of his finest productions, consisting of sixty-nine motets for the church's year. In 1613 a companion volume, <span class="italic">Cantiones sacrae octonis vocibus</span>, appeared. The thirty motets in double choir format show no influence of the <i>cori spezzati</i> of Venetian music; the choirs are almost invariably of similar make-up, and there are no obligato instruments. Indeed, the style is much more attuned to that of Rome. In the same year <span class="italic">Gemmulae sacrae</span> was issued. It is the first volume published by any Englishman to include a <i>basso continuo</i> part. In this, and in the use of music for two and three voices only, Philips was up to date, though its musical language bears no traces of the &#145;new music&#146; of Italy. The volume may have been intended for one of the local fellowships which met in order to venerate the blessed sacrament. From this point onwards all Philips's vocal music (except <span class="italic">Les rossignols spirituels</span>) includes a <i>basso continuo</i> part. Indeed the <span class="italic">Cantiones sacrae &hellip; quinis vocibus</span> was supplied with a continuo part in 1617, and <span class="italic">Cantiones sacrae octonis vocibus</span> was reissued with a <i>basso continuo</i> in 1625. Some minor pieces by Philips appeared in Salomon de Caus's <span class="italic">Les raisons des forces mouvantes</span> published at Frankfurt in 1615. Caus had been engineer to the archduke from 1605 to 1610 and probably commissioned the composer to make his arrangement of Striggio's <span class="italic">Che fera</span>, which is used to demonstrate a type of mechanical organ. It is possible that Gerard Philippi, who succeeded Caus as hydraulic engineer at the court, was Peter Philips's son.<br>
<br>In 1616 two more volumes of Philips's church music were published. <span class="italic">Deliciae sacrae</span>, a companion volume to <span class="italic">Gemmulae sacrae</span>, is for two and three voices with continuo, and may have been written for the Antwerp brotherhood of Romanists, to which only those who had visited Rome could belong. <span class="italic">Les rossignols spirituels</span>, also from 1616, is one of Philips's most fascinating productions, and the only one issued in his lifetime by a publishing house other than Phal&egrave;se (Vervlier, Valenciennes). The didactic nature of its contents (a catechism pocket book for children, with music less prominent than text), along with the fact that it constitutes Philips's only known attempt at setting French texts, makes it seem likely that the volume was the result of a commission, probably from Guillaume Marci, director of the <i>&eacute;cole dominicale</i> at Valenciennes, who may be the author of the (sometimes violently anti-protestant) texts. Philips's music is largely for soprano and bass, though he suggests that performers might add a keyboard background.<br>
<br>Plague was rife in the Netherlands in 1617 and 1618, and Philips probably wrote his two settings of plague prayers (<span class="italic">Haec est praeclarum</span> and <span class="italic">Stella coeli extirpavit</span>) at this time: both were later included in <span class="italic">Paradisus sacris</span>. There was another long period between Philips's publications of 1616 and the next volume of church music (1623). It must have been during these years that he was preparing the twelve litanies and the enormous volume of few voice motets which was to be his swansong. On 15 January 1621 he exchanged his canonry at Soignies for a perpetual chaplaincy in the church of St Germain at Tirlemont. The archduke died, childless, on 15 July 1621, and memorial ceremonies were held on 12 March 1622. Philips led the musicians of the chapel in procession, and is so drawn in Jacques Francquart's <span class="italic">Pompa funebris optimi potentissima principis Alberti Pii</span> (1623).<br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">Compleat Gentleman</span> (1622) Henry Peacham mentioned &#145;our rare countryman, Peter Philips &hellip; now one of the greatest masters of Musicke in Europe&#146;, noting that &#145;he hath sent us over many excellent songs, as well motets as madrigals: he affecteth altogether the Italian veine&#146;. At this stage Philips was just over sixty years old and had produced all his madrigals and some of his finest church music. His style would have appealed to his own countrymen, for like them he avoided the more forward-looking secular styles of Ferrara, Mantua, and Venice, and followed the musical language found in the less demanding pastoral type of madrigal.<h2>
<a name="Lateworks"></a>Late works</h2>
<span class="italic">Litaniae beatae Mariae virginis</span> (1623), twelve settings of the litany of Loreto for four, five, six, eight, and nine voices, has a title page that describes the composer as a canon of B&eacute;thune; the date at which he took up this canonry is not known, but the position was again probably a sinecure. The litanies, which do not survive complete, were Philips's last large-scale volume in the old Renaissance style. A volume of masses catalogued as belonging to the library of John IV of Portugal, and destroyed in the disastrous Lisbon earthquake and fire, is probably a mis-cataloguing of these litanies, as each begins with a <span class="roman">Kyrie</span> and has an <span class="roman">Agnus Dei</span> near the end; there is no surviving copy of any mass by Philips&#151;a surprising fact in view of his strong Roman allegiance.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1624 Philips approved Mathieu Langhedul's restoration of the organ in the court chapel. His last work was also his largest (107 motets for one, two, and three voices plus continuo): <span class="italic">Paradisus sacris cantionibus consitus</span>, 1628. It contains his most baroque music (and his only music for solo voice), as well as some that may have been written many years previously. In his early years in Rome he may have encountered such <i>concerti</i> for few voices and organ while they were being written by Viadana, or he may have come across them later, after publication. At any rate, the writing of motets for just a few voices had an obvious usefulness in a country ravaged by war and plague. Philips, it seems, was still developing in his last years.<br>
<br>According to John Southcote, Philips died in 1628; this must have been some time after the dating of the dedication of <span class="italic">Paradisus sacris</span> on 28 April. His places of death and burial are unknown. Philips was clearly a man devoted to the Roman Catholic obedience, yet there is little beyond this to illustrate his character. His style was untouched by the flow of Venetian music that resulted from the close ties between the publishing houses of Venice and Antwerp, and his own arrangements of Caccini's forward-looking <span class="italic">Amarilli</span> also seem to have had no immediate effect on his own style. But among Englishmen of the time his output was matched only by that of William Byrd, and he was one of the most prominent composers of continental Europe.<br>
