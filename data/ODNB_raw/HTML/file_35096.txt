</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Morant, Sir  Robert Laurie</span>  (1863&#150;1920), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born at Well Walk, Hampstead, London, on 7 April 1863, the only son of Robert Morant (<i>d</i>. 1873), designer of high-class furniture and silk fabrics, of Hampstead, and his wife, Helen, daughter of the Revd Henry Lea Berry, a former headmaster of Mill Hill School. Though his father died when Morant was ten his family managed to find the money to send him to be educated at Winchester College. When he went up to New College, Oxford, his financial difficulties compelled him to undertake paid tutoring work to enable him to complete his studies. He obtained a third class in classical moderations in 1882, but a first class in theology in 1885. As he decided not to go into the church but into education, the latter qualification was less useful to him than otherwise it would have been, and the undistinguished earlier performance initially excluded him from all but preparatory school teaching. He soon obtained a post at that level at Temple Grove School, East Sheen, Surrey, which he relinquished after a year, departing for Siam in 1886, and soon becoming tutor to the crown prince.<br>
<br>Morant involved himself in the reconstruction of the Siamese educational system, which led him to be called the Big Teacher. He emphasized European, and especially English, educational values, concentrating on the needs of the ruling &eacute;lite and of secondary education and teacher training. He also engaged in political activity in Siam, believing himself and his country to have a civilizing mission there, and he came to criticize the British legation for not being as active as he wanted in frustrating French imperial designs in Siam. He was seen by some as acting as if he was &#145;the Uncrowned King of Siam&#146;, and his political prominence eventually rendered his position untenable. In 1894 he returned to England where, though he pursued a career in the civil service, he was also to attract public controversy. Florence Nightingale's assessment of Morant as being &#145;a good genius&#146; was how many came to see him. This was true for Beatrice Webb, who none the less believed him to be &#145;a strange mortal, not altogether sane&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 98).<br>
<br>Mrs Webb wrote:<blockquote>We have known and liked Morant since he appeared as a student in the early days of the London School of Economics&#151;an abnormally tall and loosely knit figure, handsome in feature, shy in manner, and enigmatical in expression. At that time he was a little over thirty and at a loose end, having failed to keep an official position at the court of Siam. (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 97)</blockquote>On his return Morant took up both residence and a staff appointment at the Toynbee Hall settlement in the East End of London. During a period of poor health he was nursed by Helen Mary Cracknell, daughter of Edwin Cracknell of Wetheringsett Grange, Suffolk; they married in 1896 and had a son and a daughter.<h2>
<a name="BoardofEducation"></a>Board of Education</h2>From his base at Toynbee Hall, Morant secured an appointment as assistant director of special inquiries and reports in August 1895 in the recently created office of special inquiries and reports at the education department of the privy council. Though the education department did not anyway recruit its equivalent of first-division officials by means of the conventional civil service open competition, the office of special inquiries and reports was even more unusual in that specialized knowledge of foreign systems of education was a requirement. Too old to begin a civil service career otherwise, Morant was fortunate not only that such a tailor-made opportunity occurred, but also that the recently appointed director, Michael Sadler, was prepared to recruit an obviously gifted man, and thus a potential rival, as his deputy. It was a decision that Sadler lived to regret.<br>
<br>The office of special inquiries and reports was later described by Sadler as having been founded on the doctrine that it would &#145;tell the truth, disclose the strong and weak points of great educational policies, and behave with self restraint but unshakeable honesty in presenting matter to the Department of Education and in its published volumes of reports&#146;  (Sadler, 194&#150;5). This definition overstated the independence of the office, given that Sadler had concurred when in 1895 the vice-president of the committee of council on education, Sir John Gorst, had asked that research should be concentrated on areas specified by the Department of Education. Sadler later said that &#145;Morant had no use for scientific impartiality&#146;  (ibid., 195); but, when assistant director of the office, Morant had produced important research studies of the French and Swiss educational systems in 1897 and 1898 respectively.<br>
<br>Morant's involvement with the abortive <span class="roman">Education Bill</span> of 1896 seemed to renew his taste for politics, and brought him to the attention of Gorst, whose private secretary he became in November 1899. From this position Morant rose to become the acting permanent secretary of the Board of Education almost exactly three years later and, in April 1903, the substantive holder of that post. &#145;Morant was a very able, unscrupulous <i>arriviste</i> with a lot of educational enthusiasm, great energy, and a tongue that could be honeyed or rasping&#146;, Sadler wrote in the 1940s, adding: &#145;An Italian renaissance type I used to think then, but now I see in him an early arrival of the Fascist mentality&#146;  (Sadler, 195). This last observation seems excessive, born of the self-pitying bitterness of bureaucratic politics. It may be, as Sadler observed, that &#145;ambition, pecuniary and personal&#146; did come to characterize Morant  (ibid., 194), but, far from ruthlessly shouldering aside a much senior colleague, Morant was actually only two years younger than Sadler, and to become a permanent secretary as he did at the age of forty was not without precedent. Indeed, it could even be said to be unremarkable in circumstances in which the existing holder of the post, Sir George Kekewich, was sixty-two years old and openly opposed to government policy. As for Morant then ensuring that Sadler had no alternative to leaving the civil service in 1903, the issue between them, and between Sadler and the president of the board, Lord Londonderry, was whether Sadler could conduct independent educational research with what amounted to academic freedom. When denied this, Sadler, apparently forgetting the arrangement with Gorst eight years before, elected to resign. The main documents in this controversy were published in 1903 in a blue book entitled <span class="italic">Papers Relating to the Resignation of the Director of Special Inquiries and Reports</span>.<br>
<br>The <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1902 was politically primarily the work of A. J. Balfour, who became the Conservative prime minister during its passage, although many of the ideas behind the legislation were those of the eventually discarded Gorst. Morant was very important in the role of adviser, ever eager to apply the lessons of the Swiss model to the education system of England and Wales, and in recognition of his work he was made CB in 1902. The Liberal opposition to the legislation of 1902 derived most of its emotional force from the prospect that nonconformists would have to pay local rates which could be used to subsidize Anglican schools. The religious controversy tended to obscure the fact that the act importantly widened the opportunities for secondary education in England and Wales, as well as rationalizing the provision for elementary education. The act also changed the local educational administrative arrangements when it abolished the separate school boards which had been established by the Forster <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1870, making the counties and county boroughs into the local education authorities. The 1902 legislation was extended to cover London a year later, and opposition to the act elsewhere was eventually overridden.<br>
<br>Morant reorganized the Board of Education into an effective central instrument for the implementation of the act, which was characterized by a balance of power between the centre and the local authorities. The board made its presence felt with a series of regulations issued in bold type in publications with differently coloured covers for each type of institution. Thus, in 1903 Morant and his principal officials issued a green-covered document called <span class="italic">Regulations for the Instruction and Training of Pupil-Teachers</span>. In 1904 <span class="italic">Elementary School Code</span> was issued under a dark blue cover, and <span class="italic">Regulations for Secondary Education</span> was also issued, this time under a pale blue cover. <span class="italic">Regulations for Training Colleges</span>, issued under a plain white cover, and <span class="italic">Regulations for Evening Schools and Technical Institutes</span>, under a yellow cover, soon followed. Morant's official biographer was much impressed by the array of colours involved, but what mattered was that for the first time educational objectives were clearly set down. Morant appreciated that there was not much point either in making more formal provision for education or in issuing sets of regulations unless what was being done was evaluated. He therefore gave prominence to rationalizing the arrangements relating to his majesty's inspectorate for schools. Both at the time and subsequently <span class="italic">Regulations for Secondary Education</span> attracted most controversy for, among other things, assisting arrangements to be shaped by Treasury concerns about financial commitments, and the emphasis on general rather than vocational education proved to be a source of criticism. None the less, overall provision for secondary education increased as a result of the reforms with which Morant was associated.<br>
<br>The advent of a Liberal government in 1905 seemed to threaten the recently established educational system, but it survived. For nearly six years so did the politically contentious Morant, with his being made KCB in 1907 reflecting the respect he had earned from the Liberals for his vigorous style of administration. This was evident in the implementation of the <span class="roman">Provision of Meals Act</span> of 1906, which permissive measure led to the introduction of school meals for underprivileged children. The <span class="roman">Education (Administration Provisions) Act</span> of 1907 marked the beginning of a system of medical inspection and treatment of schoolchildren. Morant swiftly appointed Dr George Newman as chief medical officer of the board at the head of its medical department. In 1911 Morant established a university department within the board to administer the various grants that the board made for the training of teachers and for advanced science. This was the forerunner of the university grants committee. Morant was also a member of the Haldane royal commission on London University. These links with the universities proved helpful in establishing the broadly based Teachers' Registration Council. Such was Morant's commitment to the work of the Board of Education that he had refused when Lloyd George had offered him the substantially better-paid post of chairman of the Development Commission in 1909; but, two years later, the political controversy surrounding the memorandum circulated by E. G. A. Holmes, chief inspector of elementary schools, criticizing the calibre of local authority inspectors, led to Morant's position at the board being undermined. The greatest of the many achievements of the Morant years at the Board of Education was the expansion of secondary education which, by 1911, had been made available to 60 per cent of former elementary school pupils, at least in part because of the free places regulations of 1907 which Morant had put in place.<h2>
<a name="NationalinsuranceandtheMinistryofHealth"></a>National insurance and the Ministry of Health</h2>In November 1911 Morant resigned from the Board of Education and accepted an offer from the chancellor of the exchequer to become chairman of the National Insurance Commission for England. He had told Lloyd George that the only reason that he had taken on what the chancellor himself had described as the &#145;gigantic task&#146; of implementing the <span class="roman">National Insurance Act</span> was the opportunity it gave him of working towards the unification of the nation's health services, which had been his ambition ever since Newman and he had issued their first circular on the medical inspection of schoolchildren. The most immediate task was to ensure that the administrative arrangements were in place to ensure that by the set date of 15 July 1912 there was machinery to collect the contributions of 12 million people and their employers. At first Lloyd George supported Treasury objections to more than minimal staffing of the commission, but Morant told him forcefully that the legislation would fail unless he was given a free hand to recruit the people he needed, and the chancellor gave way. Government departments were more eager to get rid of their troublemakers than their most gifted administrators; but, however random the selection, this trawl for talent was the first time that the first division of the civil service had been treated as other than a collection of departmental &eacute;lites, and among the men who came to work with Morant were future stars of the higher civil service of the order of Warren Fisher, John Anderson, and Arthur Salter. The deadline for establishing the contributions machinery was met on time, but that still left another deadline, that which loomed on 15 January 1913, the date set for the introduction of the general practitioner service. The opposition of the medical profession was overcome, and this deadline was also met. Later in 1913 Morant made use of a provision in the act for the establishment of a fund for promoting medical research and the Medical Research Committee was established, which proved to be the forerunner of the Medical Research Council. Morant was the effective author of the <span class="roman">National Insurance Act</span> of 1913, which eliminated various flaws experienced in the working of the earlier legislation.<br>
<br>The coming of the First World War witnessed Morant being generous in releasing staff to other departments, but he was himself in little demand for other work, although he was an important member of the Haldane committee on the machinery of government of 1917&#150;18. When the Ministry of Health was created in June 1919, from a merger of the Local Government Board and the Insurance Commission, Morant became its first permanent secretary, having earlier acted as additional secretary to the former department. Morant set to work with what seemed to be his usual vigour, and soon introduced the reform that led to the registration of nurses and the establishment of the General Nursing Council, and began to devote himself to the subject of housing. However, years of overwork had undermined Morant's constitution, and an attack of pneumonia caused his death at his home, 17 Thurloe Square, London, on 13 March 1920. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>In 1917 Beatrice Webb observed:<blockquote>Morant is the one man of genius in the Civil Service, but he excites violent dislike in some men and much suspicion in many men. He is public spirited in his ends but devious in his methods &hellip; He certainly does not want social democracy&#151;he is an aristocrat by instinct and conviction &hellip; but in spite of his malicious tongue and somewhat tortuous ways, he has done more to improve English administration than any other man. (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 98)</blockquote>The passage of time has done nothing to undermine this assessment.<br>
