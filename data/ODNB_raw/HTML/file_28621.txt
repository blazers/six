<span class="headword">Walshe,  Walter Hayle</span>  (1812&#150;1892), <span class="occ">physician</span>, son of William Walshe, a barrister, was born in Dublin on 19 March 1812. He studied at Trinity College, Dublin, entering in 1827, but did not take a degree. In 1830 he went to live in Paris, and at first he studied oriental languages. However, in 1832 he turned his attention to medicine. He became acquainted in 1834 with the great morbid anatomist Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis, whose <span class="italic">Recherches sur la phthisie</span> he translated into English in 1844. Oliver Wendell Holmes and F. L. I. Valleix, the distinguished French physician, were his fellow students, and they became lifelong friends. Walshe moved to Edinburgh in 1835, graduated MD there in 1836, and in 1838 began practice in north London.<br>
<br>In 1839 and 1840 Walshe wrote many articles on pathology in William Birmingham Costello's <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia of Practical Surgery</span>. These contributions led to his election as professor of morbid anatomy at University College, London, in 1841. He lectured on morbid anatomy until 1846, when he was elected Holme professor of clinical medicine. In the same year he published a large volume, <span class="italic">On the Nature and Treatment of Cancer</span>, a collection of the then existing knowledge of new growths and hypotheses as to their origin. In 1848 he was appointed professor of the principles and practice of medicine, an office which he held until 1862. In his lectures he discussed points upon his fingers in the manner of schoolteachers, and he was fond of numerical statements of fact and of reaching a definite conclusion as a result of the denial of a series of alternative hypotheses. Sir William Jenner said that he had never heard a more able or clearer lecturer. Walshe was appointed physician at University College Hospital in 1844 and consulting physician in 1877. His clinical investigations were exhaustive, but his diagnoses were not always proportionately exact.<br>
<br>In 1843 Walshe published <span class="italic">The Physical Diagnosis of Diseases of the Lungs</span>, a complete and useful treatise, which was superseded before his death by Samuel Gee's <span class="italic">Auscultation and Percussion</span>. In 1851 Walshe published <span class="italic">A Practical Treatise on Diseases of the Lungs and Heart</span>, of which several editions appeared, and part of which was enlarged into <span class="italic">A Practical Treatise on the Diseases of the Heart and Great Vessels</span>. In 1852 he was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. He first lived in Upper Charlotte Street and afterwards in Queen Anne Street, and he had for some years a considerable practice as a physician. On 16 December 1869 he married Caroline Ellen (<i>b</i>. 1838/9), daughter of John Durand Baker, a clergyman; they had one son.<br>
<br>Walshe's pupils maintained that his was the first accurate description of the anatomy of movable kidney and of haemorrhage into the <i>dura mater</i>, known as haematoma; he was also the first to teach that patients with regurgitation through the aortic valves are likely to die suddenly. However, Sir Andrew Clark considered that he had little ability in the treatment of disease. Besides his books Walsh wrote many contributions to medical journals and transactions, and in 1885 he published <span class="italic">The Colloquial Linguistic Faculty and its Physiological Groundwork</span>. He was well read in acoustics, had a taste for music, especially Italian opera, and published in 1881 a short treatise, <span class="italic">Dramatic Singing Physiologically Estimated</span>. Walshe died at his home, 41 Hyde Park Square, London, on 14 December 1892. His wife survived him.<br>
