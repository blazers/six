<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wharton,  Philip James</span>, duke of Wharton and Jacobite duke of Northumberland  (1698&#150;1731), <span class="occ">rake and politician</span>, was born Philip Wharton at either Adderbury or Ditchley, Oxfordshire, probably on 21 December 1698, the only son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29175/', "Thomas Wharton, fifth Baron Wharton and later first marquess of Wharton and Malmesbury and first marquess of Catherlough (1648&#150;1715)")</script>, and his second wife, Lucy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Loftus (<i>d</i>. 1716). His godparents included William III and the future Queen Anne.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Educated privately under his domineering father's supervision, Wharton (known as Viscount Winchendon from 1706 to 1715) was groomed to perpetuate his father's political principles and cultivate similar oratorical prowess. Yet his propensity for disobedience was demonstrated in 1715 when he eloped with Martha Holmes (<i>c</i>.1700&#150;1726), the virtuous but relatively impoverished daughter of Major-General Richard Holmes. Their clandestine marriage on 2 March infuriated and embarrassed Wharton's father. Following the old marquess's death on 12 April 1715, Wharton's substantial estates were placed under the control of his mother and several of his father's whig associates. He then went to France and Switzerland to finish his education, supervised by an austere Swiss Calvinist tutor.<br>
<br>Stifled by his teacher's moralizing, Wharton abandoned him and visited James Francis Edward, the Stuart pretender to the British throne, in Avignon in August 1716, thus initiating a longstanding flirtation with the creed that had been anathema to his father. James created his impressionable visitor duke of Northumberland on 22 December 1716. By 5 December Wharton had returned to England, then proceeding to Ireland where, despite his conduct, he took his seat in the House of Lords as marquess of Catherlough on 27 August 1717, and was sworn of the privy council on 20 September 1717. His speeches and enthusiasm there sparked popular acclaim. He was created duke of Wharton in the British peerage on 28 January 1718, nearly two years shy of his majority, the youngest recipient of a dukedom, excepting close relatives of the monarch, since the fifteenth century. While it is tempting to surmise that the honour had been intended for Wharton's father, the circumstances and the peerage preamble suggest it was actually in recognition of his own merits and a desire to cement his allegiance to George I. He was introduced into the British House of Lords on his majority, 21 December 1719.<br>
<br>Hopes that Wharton would settle down as a member of the whig &eacute;lite were to be dashed; his reckless behaviour led to financial and personal crises. Prior to 1718 Wharton hardly cohabited with his wife. Following a brief reconciliation his only child, Thomas, was born in 1719, an event which brought him great joy. The child's baptism was attended by George I. Wharton's admonitions that his wife avoid London during a smallpox epidemic were ignored, and Thomas's death from the disease on 1 March 1720 precipitated additional indifference between them. Moreover, a profligacy perhaps unparalleled in Augustan England now began to demonstrate its effects. Wharton had evidently acquired loans from Jacobite bankers as early as 1718. After having sold off a sizeable portion of his Irish estates he returned from Ireland in 1720 with cash to invest in the South Sea Company. He suffered catastrophic losses of over &pound;120,000 in the subsequent crisis, partly prompting his famous diatribe against the ministry on 4 February 1721 which so infuriated James, Earl Stanhope, that it hastened Stanhope's death by stroke.<br>
<br>Wharton's social life seemed driven by a desire to take indulgence to extremes. From 1719 to 1723 he was the recognized founder and chairman of the notorious Hellfire Club, a secret organization open to members of both sexes that scandalized contemporaries with its reputed satanic rituals. Sometimes confused with a similar club later associated with Sir Francis Dashwood, Wharton's group seems to have been primarily concerned with promoting dissolute behaviour and sarcastic parodies of established religion. Wharton also served as grand master of the freemasons in 1722, sparking controversy by singing a strongly pro-Stuart ballad at a ceremony.<h2>
<a name="OppositionwhigorJacobite"></a>Opposition whig, or Jacobite?</h2>Wharton's opposition political activities and the origins and extent of his Jacobitism have long been controversial. He lent significant support to a small, determined opposition group in parliament which actively lodged protests from 1720 to 1723, and was reckoned among the group's more effective orators. He was mentored by its leader, the disgruntled whig and former lord chancellor William Cowper, first Earl Cowper. Yet Wharton's support for the opposition was, at best, fickle and inconsistent. In December 1721 he deserted his opposition friends for a bribe, and he supported the ministry in debates over the habeas corpus suspension in late 1722. His return to opposition was confirmed on 15 May 1723 by his remarkable speech defending the Jacobite conspirator Francis Atterbury, bishop of Rochester. Wharton delineated distinguishing features of each side's arguments with remarkable skill. The speech was so persuasive that it permanently established Wharton's oratorical reputation, and was printed and later included among his posthumously published writings. Less well known was Wharton's visit to Walpole the night before his speech, a visit undertaken on the pretext of seeking an overview of evidence suggesting Atterbury's guilt, so that he could speak the next day in support of the ministry's position. Wharton personally accompanied Atterbury to the ship that carried him into exile. His defence of Atterbury was followed by his publication of the <span class="italic">True Briton</span>. Printed by Samuel Richardson, who later supposedly modelled Loveless, his archetypal villainous rake, after Wharton, the <span class="italic">True Briton</span> was an influential anti-Walpole political journal published twice weekly until early 1724. Wharton composed many of its more notable essays, and the authorities lamented his public appearance as a leader of the Jacobites in the City of London, and his slanderous attacks on the government.<br>
<br>Wharton's mercurial nature and escalating indebtedness render assessments of the genuine extent of his Jacobitism quite problematic. Several studies argue that his Stuart adherence fluctuated until after 1723, while other historians see Wharton as a committed Jacobite from perhaps 1716 onwards. Whether intermittent professions of old whiggism along his father's lines were intended to sustain political influence and allow for the surreptitious provision of intelligence to the Jacobites, or merely exemplify erratic actions fogged by frequent revelries, remains uncertain. His behaviour after 1725 implies the latter, but Wharton exhibited scant inclination towards adherence to any firm principles. His most exhaustive and sympathetic biographer concludes that Wharton was largely indifferent towards Jacobitism after 1723, and engaged in its doctrines and undertook a Jacobite mission abroad merely because this was a convenient way to avoid creditors while remaining in the international limelight.<br>
<br>By 1725 Wharton was closely associated with Charles Boyle, fourth earl of Orrery, the <i>de facto</i> English Jacobite leader following Atterbury's banishment. Wharton and several other diehard ministerial opponents joined Orrery in vain attempts to maintain opposition activities from 1723&#150;5. Wharton verbally attacked the court in 1724, and protested against measures regulating City of London elections the following year. His interest in City politics reflected extensive personal influence and involvement, which was viewed as potentially valuable in a Stuart restoration, since few Jacobite politicians successfully encouraged disgruntled City politicians to oppose Walpole's ministry. Wharton also evinced sincere interest&#151;as his finances allowed&#151;in borough and county elections in areas such as Buckinghamshire and Cumberland where he possessed estates, even while abroad, but the disastrous condition of his personal affairs restricted his influence. He calculated his total debts in 1725 to exceed &pound;70,000. Anxious to flee his unhappy marriage and mounting debts, he therefore eagerly accepted appointment as Stuart plenipotentiary to the imperial court at Vienna in August 1725. Orrery, forced to lend Wharton &pound;500 to enable his departure, was named a trustee of his estates and supervised his affairs, endeavouring to sell off or mortgage estates to stave off his flamboyant friend's bankruptcy.<h2>
<a name="Jacobitediplomatist"></a>Jacobite diplomatist</h2>Wharton left for the Netherlands <i>en route</i> for Vienna in 1725. War in Europe appeared imminent. Although he was confident of success in procuring Habsburg assistance for a Jacobite invasion, his prospects were diminished by British government intelligence and his own personal habits. Prone to over-indulgence and lacking any diplomatic experience whatsoever, he publicly drank the Pretender's health before departing, and his indiscretion prompted Jacobites to fear their incrimination. Walpole's ministry rightly suspected a connection with Orrery's simultaneous trip to Paris, and soon verified the reasons for Wharton's journey. Wharton was advised by the Jacobite agent in Vienna, and eventually secured audiences with Austrian ministers and Austria's military commander, Prince Eugene of Savoy. Initial indications of co-operation in a landing of 4000 Austrian troops in England and James's dispatch to Brussels to reside under imperial protection, however, proved premature. Austrian suspicion about the strength of Jacobite support in Britain, and Wharton's dissolute behaviour, convinced the imperial council to reject his proposals outright in February 1726. Furthermore, the expulsion to Spain of Count Ripperda, an untrustworthy Austrian minister with whom Wharton had negotiated, and continuing negative publicity over the estrangement of James and his wife, hindered efforts abroad. Thus Wharton left Austria, stopping off briefly in Rome, where he received the Order of the Garter from James. He then proceeded to Madrid to confer further with Ripperda about the royal separation. There he was invested with his Jacobite KG by James Butler, second duke of Ormond, and proceeded pompously to display the order publicly.<br>
<br>In 1725 Wharton's own much maligned wife became desperately ill following a miscarriage. Languishing for months, she never fully recovered, finally expiring on 14 April 1726 at her house in Gerrard Street, Soho. The same week Wharton was summoned by privy seal order to return to England; he contemptuously discarded the document into a Madrid gutter. Ripperda subsequently betrayed to British authorities Wharton's elaborate plans for an Austro-Russian alliance with Spain to enthrone the Pretender, and his betrayal effectively alienated Wharton from other leading Jacobites in Spain. By the time he learned of his wife's death Wharton was already in love with a Spanish maid of honour, Maria Theresa O'Neill O'Beirne (1706?&#150;1777), daughter of a colonel in the Spanish service, Henry O'Beirne, and his wife, Henrietta O'Neill. Only after strenuous efforts could he persuade the Spanish queen to consent to their marriage; evidently a prerequisite was Wharton's conversion to Roman Catholicism. In the afternoon of 23 July 1726 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, following a long examination by Spanish inquisitors, Wharton married the object of his affections in a simple ceremony that immediately provoked gossip.<br>
<br>Wharton's conversion effectively ruined his remaining significance in Jacobite politics, yet it may have been designed to rally the support of Irish Jacobite exiles in Spain under his leadership. None the less sceptical observers generally interpreted his religious change as irrefutable proof of his untrustworthiness. It was thought that Wharton's conversion to acquire a wife meant he might &#145;exchange his Loyalty for the Means of Maintaining her for no body thinks that he has any fix'd Principles&#146;  (Stuart papers, 95/128). Jacobite leaders often concurred, infuriated by such conversions and anxious about resulting perceptions among British supporters. Although sympathetic, even Atterbury grimly concluded the conversion had irreversibly rendered Wharton a liability. Wharton vainly attempted to defend his conversion as a long contemplated step, but his actions and subsequent comments provide meagre evidence that religious precepts mattered greatly to him. When chided by Atterbury for his conversion Wharton responded that people might just as easily think he had mutated into a Turkish Muslim. Contemporaries believed he had intentionally scorned religion by engaging in clamorous Sabbath-day hunting on his estates. His lifestyle, and the fact that he frequently voiced aspirations such as serving as one of Satan's courtiers, hardly endeared him to religious leaders or popular opinion. He enjoyed flaunting his disdain for any form of authority or ideology; one Jacobite remarked that his &#145;slighting expressions of the Scriptures&#146; proved that Wharton's politics were as &#145;unsettl'd as his Principles of Religion&#146;  (ibid.).<h2>
<a name="Declineanddeath"></a>Decline and death</h2>After his marriage and conversion, opinions of Wharton deteriorated to new levels of ridicule. Astonished diplomats relayed how on his wedding night he had become &#145;drunk early&#146; and had &#145;produced, in the midst of the Grave Dons and their dames, what (to use his own expression) he told his bride <i>she was to have that night in her Gutts</i>&#146;  (TNA: PRO, State papers foreign, 78/184/230<i>v</i>), dispersing his wedding party in chaos. Jacobites who once esteemed Wharton their most influential adherent now lamented this &#145;wild, Giddy &amp; unaccountable Man&#146;  (Stuart papers, 95/110). If his licentiousness was not sufficiently outrageous, his desperate poverty provoked both humour and disgust. Dishevelled and reclusive, reduced to stealing food from acquaintances, he was now an impoverished, aristocratic pariah rejected by Spaniards and fellow Britons. He and his wife retired to a village to survive frugally and avoid harassment by omnipresent creditors. In defiance, he tried to resign his British dukedom and sold it for a pittance, returning a deed repudiating the title to George I. In 1726 and 1727 Wharton repeatedly requested he be allowed to return to Rome.<br>
<br>Increasingly ignored by his former master, Wharton was inspired by other Jacobite exiles and joined the Spanish army as it engaged the British in the war that erupted in 1727. Wharton was commissioned lieutenant-colonel in the Hainault regiment, composed of Irish exiles, and named aide to the Spanish commander of an expedition besieging Gibraltar. Here in May 1727 Wharton attempted to dispel his widely held reputation for cowardice. Emboldened by brandy, he approached British troops defending the fortress wall and taunted them with obscenities and huzzahs for the Pretender. In an ensuing bombardment a bursting shell partially shattered Wharton's foot. Although he recovered from the wound, he was unable to continue his active military career. More significantly, his actions in taking up arms against British forces prompted his indictment as a traitor, and on 3 April 1729 parliament passed an informal, though arguably not legally binding, resolution that was held to have outlawed him and made his estates and titles forfeit. Although he secured a brief clandestine interview with James at Parma, he was denied hope of further Jacobite employment.<br>
<br>With his trustees now prohibited from dispatching any additional funds, Wharton abruptly sought to reconcile himself to the British government. He travelled to Paris in 1728 and approached the Hanoverian regime via Walpole's brother Horatio, the British resident in France. In several letters and a personal visit, Wharton asked for clemency, insisting he had resigned from the Pretender's service over a year earlier. In exchange, he assured authorities he would reveal detailed Jacobite intelligence, yet only &#145;as far as was consistent with his honour&#146;  (Coxe, 2.633&#150;4). Consistent to his own nature, Wharton proceeded straight from the ambassador's house to dine with the attainted Atterbury. His haughty caveat hardly inspired government leniency. Since Walpole's spies already provided ample reports of Jacobite activities, including Wharton's, and he was judged so universally discredited as to nullify his political influence, the offer was curtly rejected by George II and his secretary of state, the duke of Newcastle.<br>
<br>Ensconced in modest lodgings in Rouen, growing ever more desperate, Wharton was now such an embarrassment to the Jacobites that he was firmly admonished not to journey to Rome. James enforced these warnings with a series of small bribes. By 1729 Wharton and his wife had returned to Spain, forced to subsist off his small regimental salary. In the following year his wife's mother's death terminated a pension from the Spanish court shared with her daughter and wayward son-in-law. At a formal ball he was insulted by the valet of the governor of Barcelona. After administering a fierce caning to the valet, he was briefly imprisoned and then banished from the city. He publicly renounced the Pretender and unsuccessfully requested another pardon in 1730. Years of drunkenness and subsisting largely on brandy rendered him exhausted and malnourished. After a brief recovery he was driven to seek relief at a Franciscan monastery near Poblet, where he died alone among strangers on 31 May 1731, and was buried the following day. He signed his will Philip James, the second forename presumably assumed to indicate his Jacobitism. Wharton's passing nearly went unnoticed among leading Jacobites. Perhaps secretly relieved, James lamented his widow's destitution, supplied her with a small pension, and employed Orrery to help secure her jointure, which was achieved with the proving of Wharton's will in 1736. Maria Theresa settled in London, where she enjoyed a long, modestly comfortable, secluded life until her death in Golden Square, Westminster, on 13 February 1777. She was buried in St Pancras old churchyard. After Wharton's death his titles almost certainly all became extinct, but despite this the barony of Wharton was successfully claimed by a descendant of one of his aunts in 1915. In 1733 Wharton's forfeited estates were settled on trustees for the payment of his debts, the surplus to benefit his sisters, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1761) and Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1739).<h2>
<a name="Literaryactivityandreputation"></a>Literary activity and reputation</h2>Wharton was intermittently involved in various types of literary and journalistic activities. In addition to the <span class="italic">True Briton</span> he briefly assisted Nathaniel Mist in composing anti-Walpole rhetoric from Rouen in 1728 that proved so effective that Walpole offered Wharton a complete pardon, preservation of his estates, and retention of all his titles, if only he agreed to abstain from such public attacks. Pride, arrogance, and stubbornness prevented his acceptance. After his death Wharton's writings were collected and released in several forms. <span class="italic">Select and Authentick Pieces</span> was published in France in 1731 and included his speech defending Atterbury and the 1728 attack on Walpole. A somewhat unconvincing argument for Wharton's actions, hinging upon his adoption of Jacobitism in the spirit of liberty and genuine pre-1714 whiggism, was contained in his 1728 essay <span class="italic">Reasons for Leaving his Native Country</span>, which was also the centrepiece of <span class="italic">The Life and Writings of Philip, Late Duke of Wharton</span>, published in 1732. A number of brief miscellaneous poems and parodies are also attributed to Wharton. Before his flight from England in 1725 Wharton was the object of numerous play dedications. Supposedly fluent in at least five languages, Wharton's Latin expertise was obtained through an intense friendship with Dr Edward Young, whose character Lorenzo in Young's <span class="italic">Night Thoughts</span> is thought to be modelled on Wharton, and whose intercession supposedly secured an unpaid &pound;250 bequest to All Souls, Oxford, for which Wharton was promised an inscription and honorary doctorate.<br>
<br>Accounts of Wharton's life generally take one of two approaches. Sympathetic writers strenuously attempt to explain away his groundless beliefs and apparent lack of moral and political principles, insisting that in his case &#145;strict logic &hellip; leads to the most hopeless confusion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Writings</span>, ed. Melville, 142). Others have adopted a more condemnatory tone. Unpredictable and unreliable, Wharton's juvenile outbursts of spiteful behaviour, his tendency toward inebriated self-denial and incessant protestations of unaccountability for his actions, his cowardice, and his profound deviation from his father's politics, coupled with an excessive perception of self-importance and arrogance, and strong ambition to be a party leader, ultimately cast him as an aristocratic master dissembler, shunned by friend and foe alike. His personality was characterized by audacity and eccentricity, and brief, fleeting glimmers of brilliance and wit, and contemporaries often chastised his fondness for prankish behaviour viewed as beneath his station. Indeed, most of his life lends itself to anecdotal narration, such as his hiring of musicians and a funeral hearse for processions commemorating the death of the South Sea Company.<br>
<br>Although much new information has emerged in the last century about specific aspects of Wharton's various activities, the salient features of his life remain those noticed by earlier biographers: reckless abandon seemingly driven by an utter inability for self-control and contemporary decorum, and a squandering of an undeniable stock of personal talent and an enormous fortune. Erratic political allegiances and intermittent Jacobite support inevitably raise questions of his sincerity for any creed or principles. Pope's &#145;Epistle to Sir Richard Temple&#146; portrayed Wharton as &#145;the scorn and wonder of our days&#146;, a gifted individual destined for greatness but who, &#145;wanting nothing but an honest heart&#146;, was &#145;Too rash for thought, for action too refined&#146;. Despite possible mitigating factors for his actions and his personality with its inherent flaws, it is extremely difficult not to conclude as did one Jacobite contemporary, that there were few examples &#145;of a Man who had so fair a Game in his hands &amp; that play'd it so ill&#146;  (Stuart papers, 96/8).<br>
