<span class="headword">Doxford, Sir  William Theodore</span>  (1841&#150;1916), <span class="occ">shipbuilder</span>, was born at Bridge Street, Bishopwearmouth, Sunderland, co. Durham, on 1 February 1841, the first of four sons in a family of ten children of the merchant shipwright William Doxford (1812&#150;1882) and his wife, Hannah (1814&#150;1895), daughter of Robert Pile, a glassworker. His father made several abortive attempts to set up in business as a wooden shipbuilder before finally succeeding during the 1850s; in 1858 he opened a shipyard at Pallion on the south bank of the River Wear, near Sunderland. Doxford began work there after being educated at Bramham College, and in 1863 he married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1916), daughter of Richard Wilkinson, a Sunderland shipbuilder. They had one son and five daughters.<br>
<br>Only after the decision was taken in 1864 to build iron ships did the Doxford shipyard make significant progress. The output of 3000 tons of shipping in 1864 had trebled to 9500 tons by 1872. In order to build their own marine engines the Doxfords erected engine and boiler shops in 1878, with a younger brother, Robert Doxford, in charge. When their father died in 1882, all four sons were involved in the management of the business. By this time Doxfords had probably the leading shipyard on the River Wear.<br>
<br>The Doxfords had an eye for technical innovation. In 1875 they built their first naval vessels, and twelve years later the firm installed oil-burning boilers in a torpedo boat. However, the Admiralty proved uninterested in this novel idea at that time. Doxford dominated the family management, and in 1891 the firm became a limited liability company with a capital of &pound;200,000, all owned by the Doxford family. In the following year the firm introduced its &#145;turret ship&#146;, a design which brought Doxfords both fame and fortune.<br>
<br>The turret ship was based on the American whaleback steamer then active on the Great Lakes. The hull bent inwards from a little way above the waterline to give a curved deck&#151;a whaleback&#151;across the top of the vessel. Steering platforms and other openings projected from the whaleback in vertical structures or &#145;turrets&#146;. One of these American vessels visited Liverpool in the early 1890s and attracted great interest. Doxfords was commissioned to build a similar vessel under licence. While it did so, A. H. Havers, the firm's chief draughtsman, prepared his own design for a turret ship, and it was patented in the name of Charles Doxford. The principal innovation was that there was now one long turret running the length of the ship.<br>
<br>The first Doxford turret ship appeared in 1892 and after some initial reluctance from shipowners the type soon became very popular, the Clan Line alone taking no fewer than thirty such ships. In all, between 1892 and 1911, Doxfords built 176 turret ships at Sunderland, while six others were built under licence in other British shipyards and one in Spain. In 1903 Havers sued the company, demanding recognition as the inventor of the turret ship. Doxfords showed that Havers had been handsomely rewarded by the firm, but the jury still awarded him damages of &pound;1250. Nevertheless, this was still only a small slice from the &pound;150,000 profit which Doxfords was said to have made by that time out of the turret ship.<br>
<br>Besides its inherent strength, helped by a cellular double bottom, the turret ship was also popular with shipowners in the bulk trades because its net tonnage (often used to calculate harbour charges) was low in relation to its deadweight tonnage (the actual weight of cargo carried). Also, the Suez Canal dues were based on the breadth of the upper deck, which on a turret ship was usually half the actual width of the vessel; however, the success of the turret ship led to the canal rules being altered. Between 1907 and 1909 a number of losses and accidents involving turret ships caused alarm, but these were found to be largely due to incorrect loading rather than to faults in the design of the ship. Nevertheless, the popularity of the turret ship waned and the last one was built in 1911.<br>
<br>The turret ship brought great prosperity to the Doxford shipyard. It launched over 100,000 tons of shipping in 1906 and while the totals for 1905 and 1907 were only about 90,000 tons, this was sufficient to make Doxfords the most productive shipyard in the world in those years. Such productivity was possible because in 1904 the shipyard had been rebuilt. The original five building berths were scrapped to make way for three berths of greater length, each capable of building a 12,000 ton ship. By 1914 the capital of William Doxford &amp; Sons Ltd was &pound;450,000 and it made a profit of &pound;160,000.<br>
<br>Doxfords also took the bold step of beginning the development of a marine diesel engine. At that time diesel technology was dominated by continental European firms, but, under the engineer K. O. Keller, Doxfords began research and design work in 1906. The first experimental engine was ready by 1912 and the first opposed-piston engine was built in 1913. The Doxford engine did not become a commercial success until after the First World War, but the basis had been laid before 1914 for the firm to achieve the distinction of being the only British company to produce a successful marine diesel engine.<br>
<br>As well as the technical side of shipbuilding, Doxford took a close interest in labour relations, being aware from his own family history of the hardships that could be caused by the fluctuations in the shipbuilding trade. He helped to make a success of the conciliation board established in Sunderland in 1885 and he was a witness to the royal commission on labour in 1892. He often represented Wearside on the National Federation of Shipbuilding Employers and was chairman of the Wear Shipbuilders' Association from 1908 to 1912.<br>
<br>Doxford was the first Conservative to be elected for Sunderland for forty years when he became a Unionist MP in 1895. Knighted in 1900, he retired from parliament in 1906. He was actively involved in local affairs, serving on the Sunderland town council and as a River Wear commissioner, in addition to being a magistrate in both the town of Sunderland and co. Durham. He was also a deputy lieutenant of the county. He was a foundation member and second president of the North-East Coast Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders. He joined the Institution of Naval Architects in 1878, and was elected a council member in 1896 and vice-president in 1908.<br>
<br>Still head of the family firm, Doxford died on 1 October 1916, at his home, Grindon Hall, Silksworth, Sunderland, co. Durham, a few months after the death of his wife. An obituary in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Institution of Naval Architects</span>, surveying Doxford's career, noted that he had been &#145;associated with all the principal developments in shipbuilding and marine engineering from the days of wooden ships&#146;  (49, 1917, 233).<br>
