<span class="headword">Herbert,  Henry</span>, second earl of Pembroke  (<em>b. </em>in or after 1538, <em>d.</em> 1601), <span class="occ">nobleman and administrator</span>, was the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13055/', "William Herbert, first earl of Pembroke (1506/7&#150;1570)")</script>, and his first wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70739/', "Anne Herbert (b. before 1514, d. 1552)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13055/', "Herbert, William (1506/&#150;1570)")</script>], daughter of Sir Thomas Parr and sister of Queen Katherine Parr [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4893/', "Katherine (1512&#150;1548)")</script>]. Lord Herbert, as he was known after his father's elevation to the earldom in 1551, first married, on 25 May 1553 when still a boy, Katherine Grey (1540&#150;1568) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25157/', "Seymour, Katherine")</script>]. This marriage was planned by John Dudley, duke of Northumberland, to gain Pembroke's support for the succession of his own daughter-in-law, Lady Jane Grey, Katherine's elder sister. After the failure of the plot and the accession of Mary, the marriage was annulled on the ground of non-consummation. Herbert in no way suffered as a result of his links with Dudley's plans. He was made a knight of the Bath at Mary's coronation on 29 September 1553 and later became a gentleman of the bedchamber to King Philip. When his father was appointed to lead the English forces to France in 1557, Herbert accompanied him and was present at the siege of St Quentin. In February 1563 he married for the second time; his new wife was Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1576), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26928/', "George Talbot, sixth earl of Shrewsbury")</script>; they had no children. She died in May 1576. Eleven months later on 21 April 1577 he married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13040/', "Mary Herbert, n&#233;e Sidney (1561&#150;1621)")</script>, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25520/', "Sir Henry Sidney")</script> and sister to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25522/', "Sir Philip Sidney")</script>. They had three children who survived infancy: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13058/', "William Herbert (1580&#150;1630)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13042/', "Philip Herbert (1584&#150;1650)")</script>, and Anne.<br>
<br>In 1570 Herbert succeeded his father in the earldom and was appointed lord lieutenant of Wiltshire, intermittently to begin with and permanently from 1586. The first earl had been granted large estates in Wiltshire and Glamorgan as a reward for services to the crown under Edward VI, and the principal family home was at Wilton, near Salisbury. With the decline of the older Wiltshire peers, Stourton and Hungerford, and the temporary eclipse of the Seymours, Pembroke was very much the dominant figure in the county, striving successfully to build up influence over parliamentary elections, but mostly standing aloof from the faction-fighting in the shire. He played a larger part in the political contests in Glamorgan, where he could count upon the support of his numerous Herbert cousins. Here, too, he wielded considerable influence over the return of men to parliament: his brother-in-law Sir Robert Sidney was knight of the shire in 1584 and 1593. The vigorous feuds in the county often revolved around the hostility of the major gentry towards Pembroke himself and his Herbert allies. His dominance was confirmed and extended when Pembroke was appointed to succeed his father-in-law, Sir Henry Sidney, as lord president of the council in the marches of Wales in 1586.<br>
<br>Pembroke had some advantages for the post over his predecessor. He could speak Welsh, had much experience of Wales, and was, indeed, described by a Welsh contemporary as <i>llygad holl Cymru</i> (&#145;the eye of all Wales&#146;; <span class="italic">DWB</span>, 351). On the other hand he had already made enemies. One of them, William Mathew of Radur, Glamorgan, bitterly attacked the appointment: &#145;I never harde it thought agreeable with the law of this or of any country whatsoever &hellip; that such a one should hear &hellip; our capital causes of whom &hellip; all our lands, especially within Monmouth and Glamorgan shires are holden&#146;  (Williams, <span class="italic">Council in the Marches</span>, 276). Pembroke was quick to make more enemies yet. He rightly saw that many abuses had crept into the council during Sidney's last years and set out to remedy them. Within a short time he had united against himself almost all the officers of the council, who had until then been quarrelling among themselves for years. By the middle of the 1590s Pembroke had also alienated the judges on the council, who successfully reduced his authority. From about 1595 he engaged in a bitter feud with Robert Devereux, earl of Essex, who was building up a rival faction in Wales: Pembroke's tactlessness equalled or even exceeded that of Essex himself, and it was soon reported from court that he &#145;hath very few friends or none left here, himself so careless of them when he hath them&#146;  (Collins, 1.382). In the 1570s and 1580s Pembroke had been an influential figure at court, Leicester and he referring to one another as father and son. But by the end of his life he had antagonized most of his friends, while his attempts to reform the council had ended in failure.<br>
<br>Pembroke's life at Wilton, however, was more positive, thanks largely to his wife. &#145;In her time&#146;, wrote Aubrey, &#145;Wilton House was like a college, there were so many and ingenious persons. She was the greatest patroness of wit and learning of any lady in her time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 1.312&#150;13). Principal among her guests was her brother Philip Sidney, who wrote much of the <span class="italic">Old Arcadia</span> there. But Pembroke himself played a role as patron, appointing Fulke Greville as secretary to the council in the marches and Abraham France as queen's solicitor there. His chaplain, Gervase Babington, probably owed his preferment to the see of Llandaff to Pembroke. In the theatre he patronized Burbage's company, known as Pembroke's men. During the last five years of his life his health declined: &#145;I dream of nothing but death, I hear of little but death, and &hellip; I desire nothing but death,&#146; he wrote to Sir Francis Hastings on Christmas eve 1595  (Brennan, 101). There were signs of dissension in the family. His son William asked Robert Cecil to secure for him the queen's permission to stay at Wilton with his father, otherwise the latter would give away all his money. Pembroke died at Wilton on 19 January 1601, &#145;leaving his lady as bare as he could and bestowing all on the young lord, even to her jewels&#146;, according to John Chamberlain  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 1.116). This is not, however, borne out by his will, in which he left the countess jewels and plate to the value of 3000 marks and substantial rents, both for her life or until she married again. He was buried in Salisbury Cathedral.<br>
<br>Pembroke emerges as intelligent, forceful, perceptive, but disastrously lacking in tact. He once sent a letter to the queen which his secretary refused to deliver, thinking it dangerous to have &#145;so passionate a letter delivered unto the Queen&#146;  (<span class="italic">De L'Isle and Dudley MSS</span>, 2.200). His persistent ill health seriously hampered his attempts to reform the council in the marches.<br>
