<span class="headword">Duncan,  Charles</span>  (1865&#150;1933), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born on 8 June 1865 at 93 Stockton Street, Middlesbrough, the son of Alexander Duncan, a ship's pilot, and his wife, Jane Dobson. The family had a comfortable lifestyle and Charles was able to attend the local church school until he was sixteen. He then served an engineering apprenticeship, joining the Amalgamated Society of Engineers (ASE) in 1888. He served as its district secretary for a time, and retained his membership of this skilled union for the rest of his life. In 1890 he married Lydia Copeland.<br>
<br>Duncan became a socialist in 1887, apparently primarily motivated by a concern to improve the lives of those less fortunate than himself, and this led to his active involvement in local welfare issues and his election to Middlesbrough town council as an Independent Labour Party member from 1895 to 1900. At the same time Duncan was a supporter of Tom Mann's campaign to reform the ASE and this led to his appointment as a full-time official of the new Workers' Union in 1898. Formed in the aftermath of the defeat of the engineers in the 1897 lock-out, this body was based on Mann's political ideals: it aimed to create a single union for all workers, devoted to industrial militancy and the promotion of Labour candidates in local and national elections. However, in 1901 the union still had fewer than 5000 members, and Mann emigrated to Australia in the course of that year. Duncan, who had been appointed general secretary the year before, became the dominant influence.<br>
<br>In Duncan's first years as leader, the Workers' Union faced a period of rising unemployment and falling membership, and he responded not only with rigid economies in administration but also with two fundamental departures from the organization's original aims. First, influenced by his own experiences in the ASE, he introduced elementary welfare benefits to provide individuals with a financial incentive for steady membership. Second, he gradually shifted recruitment towards semi-skilled workers with some security of employment. These departures helped to stabilize membership and finances, but not to develop internal democracy: patchy recruitment undermined the branch structure, and lack of resources inhibited district and national procedures. However, the union was now well-placed for explosive growth in the 1910&#150;14 boom when its membership rose from 5000 to over 140,000 members.<br>
<br>Despite Tom Mann's return after ten years and his appearance on the union's platforms as a prophet of syndicalism, Duncan retained the real control and maintained his cautious emphasis on financial strength and steady recruitment, especially among semi-skilled workers in light engineering in the midlands. This focus of recruitment became even more marked during the First World War when the expansion of munitions production led to a flood of new labour, including women, into the engineering industry and also into the Workers' Union, which by 1919 claimed to be the largest single union in the country with half a million members.<br>
<br>It was unlikely that this position could be maintained after the end of the exceptional wartime conditions, but the boom of the immediate post-war years encouraged optimism and Duncan introduced a more generous scheme of unemployment benefits late in 1920, in an effort to stabilize the still highly volatile membership. Unfortunately the almost immediate onset of heavy unemployment initiated a sharp downward spiral in which membership collapsed, income from subscriptions fell, and the insecurity of benefit provision led to further losses of members: by the end of 1922 the union had only 150,000 members and a deficit of &pound;30,000. Duncan's best efforts at rigid economy and new recruitment were unfortunately undermined by the general strike of 1926, which involved almost half of the union's members and cost almost &pound;60,000: in order to avoid terminal collapse he had to negotiate a merger with the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU) in 1929. Although its own history had thus come to a rather depressing conclusion, the Workers' Union was to have a major influence within the TGWU, giving it the skeleton organization to make a long-term shift away from dockers and transport workers into what were to be more dynamic fields of recruitment, above all in the motor industry.<br>
<br>In parallel with his career as a trade union leader, Duncan had a long, but not very distinguished, career in parliament. He was first elected as an MP for Barrow in Furness in 1906, sponsored by the ASE, and he held this seat until 1918, serving for a time as a Labour whip. He was an enthusiastic patriot during the First World War and a member of the British Workers' League, until it became clear that it would oppose Labour candidates in the 1918 general election. However, Duncan's resignation from the league was too late to save his seat. Keen to return to parliament he was unsuccessful in two by-elections in 1920, but held the safe Derbyshire mining seat of Clay Cross from 1922 until 1933. After the union amalgamation of 1929 he retained a nominal official position with the TGWU but was restricted mainly to a role as one of its parliamentary representatives.<br>
<br>Charles Duncan was a quiet, well-dressed man with an unusually alert and upright appearance, possibly due to prowess as an athlete in his youth. In addition to his trade union and parliamentary careers he was active in the Willesden co-operative society, and became a JP for Middlesex in 1919. After a long illness Duncan died in Manor House Hospital, North End Road, Hampstead, on 6 July 1933. He was survived by his wife.<br>
