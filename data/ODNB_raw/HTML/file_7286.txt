<span class="headword">Davis,  John Ford</span>  (1773&#150;1864), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Bath and educated at the school of the Revd Edward Spencer. He then studied medicine, first in London and afterwards in Edinburgh, where he graduated MD on 24 June 1797. His whereabouts between that date and 30 September 1808, when he became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in London, are not known, but there is indirect evidence that he was back in Bath, perhaps in dispensary practice, for at least part of the time. Certainly, very soon after he obtained his licence, he set up in practice in that city.<br>
<br>Davis's first hospital appointment was as consulting physician to the Bath Eye Infirmary in 1811, the year of its foundation. He was elected physician to the General Hospital at Bath in 1817 and held the office for seventeen years; he retired in 1834 as senior physician. His main published works were his graduation thesis, <span class="italic">Tentamen chemico-medicum inaugurale de contagio</span> (1797) and <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Symptoms and Treatment of Carditis or the Inflammation of the Heart</span> (1808). The thesis was based upon Y. Van Diemerbroeck's treatise on the plague, on James Carmichael Smyth's <span class="italic">Description of the Jail Distemper</span> (1795), and on several of the chemical works of the period. It contained no original observation on fever, and, excepting two or three chemical conjectures, was a mere compilation.<br>
<br>Davis's book on carditis, published very early in his career, described three cases of which Davis himself had seen only one; presumably he had been told about the others by friends and colleagues at Bath&#151;one of the patients had been under the care of John Haygarth, probably at Chester, more than twenty years before. The case histories were supplemented by an extensive review of previous writing, some as far back as the twelfth century, on inflammation of the heart. This somewhat slight publication is significant for two reasons. First, it was an early recognition that inflammation could involve the whole substance of the heart, resulting not only in pericarditis, a familiar pathological finding for centuries. Second, it was an example of the wrong choice being made in the debate, current at the time, on the cause of carditis. The possibility that this disease could be due to rheumatic fever had been under consideration in Britain for ten years or more, and some Bath physicians were familiar with the idea. Davis, however, and despite a suggestion by a colleague, John Sherwen, that his cases could be rheumatic, regarded this as no more than &#145;doubtful&#146;. His book was quite widely quoted in the following years but was rather roughly treated by reviewers; one wrote, in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal</span>, &#145;Dr Davis has seen but one case of carditis and, out of it he has manufactured a book&#146;  (<span class="italic">EMSJ</span>, 354&#150;5). By 1832 the situation was much clearer and that year Davis published a second short volume, entitled <span class="italic">Pericarditis or Rheumatism of the Heart</span>.<br>
<br>A third subject on which Davis wrote was the composition of the Bath waters. He has been quoted as describing, for the first time, vegetable matter floating on the surface of the water at certain seasons of the year. There is no suggestion in a publication on the Bath waters by R. W. Falconer that this finding was of any therapeutic&#151;or toxicological&#151;significance.<br>
<br>Davis was also active in the affairs of his native city. He was elected councillor for the first time in January 1811 and held several civic offices&#151;as chief constable, bailiff, and alderman. He was a justice of the peace from 1827 to 1830, and in the latter year was elected mayor. His last appearance at the council was in December 1835. Davis and his wife, Louisa, lived for many years at 13 Royal Crescent, Bath, where he died, on 1 January 1864, aged ninety.<br>
