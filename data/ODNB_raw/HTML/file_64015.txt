<span class="headword">Birk <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wilson]</span>,  Alma Lillian</span>, Baroness Birk  (1917&#150;1996), <span class="occ">politician and journalist</span>, was born on 22 September 1917 at 10 Belgrave Place, Brighton, the daughter of Barnett Wilson (formerly Woolfson) of Stamford Hill, London, and his wife, Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tosh. Her father ran a successful greeting-card company, and she enjoyed a comfortable upbringing. She was educated at South Hampstead high school and the London School of Economics (LSE). Her youthful socialism became more deeply rooted at the LSE, and after graduating she was involved in Labour politics in Finchley. She married, on 24 December 1939, at Hampstead Garden Suburb synagogue, Ellis Samuel Birk [<i>see below</i>], then a solicitor's clerk, of East Finchley. They had one son and one daughter. Alma and Ellis Birk shared a commitment to socialism and both supported the Fabian Society. While he was stationed in Wiltshire with the army during the war she unsuccessfully contested a seat on Salisbury city council. She later won a seat on Finchley borough council and served as leader of the small Labour group from 1950 to 1953. A woman of great energy, and matching ambition, she was involved with the Howard League for penal reform, the Hendon hospital group, and numerous organizations concerned with child welfare and the Jewish community. At the general election of 1950 she contested Ruislip-Northwood, a Conservative stronghold, for the Labour Party: she was a distant second. Her chances were better at Portsmouth West in 1951, where she lost narrowly. She was encouraged to stand again, only to lose by a greater margin in 1955. It was her last parliamentary candidacy.<br>
<br>Besides politics, Alma Birk's other great interest lay in journalism. She began with a column in <span class="italic">Forward</span>, a Labour weekly of Gaitskellite leanings, and from there she moved to the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>, which was acquired by the Mirror Group, to which her husband was legal adviser. Her journalistic career entered an exciting new phase when she became associate editor of <span class="italic">Nova</span>, a post she held from 1965 to 1969. <span class="italic">Nova</span> proclaimed itself as: &#145;The new kind of magazine for the new kind of woman&#146;. With Dennis Hackett, the editor, Birk assembled a team of writers who dealt frankly with social and sex problems. It was a radical departure from the &#145;standard diet of knitting patterns and home hints&#146;  (<span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, 2 Jan 1997). Birk contributed her own articles and made sure that <span class="italic">Nova</span> stood out on the news-stands with arresting covers. The magazine had a lasting influence, although within a few years of the arrival of <span class="italic">Cosmopolitan</span> it had folded, outpaced by a racier rival. By then Birk had moved on, her career firmly directed towards politics.<br>
<br>In 1967 Harold Wilson recognized Birk's political and public activities with a life peerage. She was to be a working peer, intended to strengthen the Labour element in the upper chamber. To some observers, though, it was a blatantly political appointment, since Ellis Birk was by now powerful in the Mirror Group, upon which the prime minister relied for press support. Alma Birk nevertheless proved a highly conscientious and effective member of the upper house, where her elegant dress, slim figure, and gold-auburn hair attracted special attention. She would remark self-deprecatingly, &#145;they call me the poor man's Barbara Castle&#146;, but to the friends who knew the extent of her husband's directorships &#145;she was more the rich man's Barbara Castle&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 31 Dec 1996). As chairman of the Health Education Council from 1969 to 1972 she impressed her chief, Richard Crossman, with her dynamism and executive ability, and she used to good effect the talents as a publicist that she had developed at <span class="italic">Nova</span>. In March 1974 she was made a government whip, and in October she became parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Department of the Environment, with responsibility also for transport and Treasury affairs. Shortly before the general election of 1979 she became minister of state in the privy council office.<br>
<br>Birk continued to give devoted service when Labour were in opposition. She was front-bench spokesman on the environment from 1979 to 1986 and on the arts, libraries, heritage, and broadcasting from 1986 to 1993, the role in which she was probably happiest. She and her husband were notable patrons of the performing arts and in particular of the open-air theatre at Regent's Park, from which she took her title. She was a member of the Theatres' Trust, a director of the British Film Institute, and president of the Association of Art Institutions (1984&#150;96). Her long list of public commitments included being a prison visitor at Holloway from 1967 to 1971, vice-president of the Council of Children's Welfare from 1968 to 1975, vice-president of Redbridge Jewish Youth Centre from 1970, and a member of the Holocaust Memorial Committee. Although frail from illness in her last days, Alma Birk would still respond to a three-line whip in the House of Lords, where she could be found &#145;walking with a stick &hellip; chatting her lively way through the division lobby&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 3 Jan 1997). She died of breast cancer on 29 December 1996 at her home, Flat 1, 34 Bryanston Square, Westminster.<br>

<a name="cosubject_93830"></a><span class="headword">Ellis Samuel Birk</span>  (1915&#150;2004), <span class="occ">lawyer and newspaper executive</span>, was born Elias Samuel Birk on 30 October 1915 at 3 Tankerville Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, the son of Barnett Birk, a successful financial agent, and his wife, Sylvia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Finkelstone; his parents were Orthodox Jews who had emigrated from Ritova in Lithuania. Birk was educated at Clifton College, at which time he became a socialist (he later described himself as a &#145;Gaitskellite socialist&#146;) and a lifelong member of the Labour Party. He studied classics and law at Jesus College, Cambridge, and served with the Royal Artillery during the Second World War. In 1946 he joined&#151;through his father's influence&#151;the City lawyers Nicholson, Graham, and Jones. There he met the shipping magnate Sir John Ellerman, who noted Birk's considerable ability as a lawyer and who, in 1950, appointed him as his nominee on the board of the <span class="italic">Sunday Pictorial</span>, part of the Mirror Group of newspapers, in which Ellerman had a large interest. In this capacity Birk met Hugh Cudlipp, who in 1951 became editorial director of the <span class="italic">Pictorial</span> and <span class="italic">Mirror</span> at the invitation of the group's new chairman, Cecil King. Birk and Cudlipp formed a close partnership (dubbed the Fire Brigade) that sought to oversee and control the actions of King during the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>'s heyday of the early to mid-1960s. Birk also made a significant, if obscure, contribution to King's downfall in May 1968 after the chairman had published an article, entitled &#145;Enough is enough&#146;, calling for the dismissal of the prime minister, Harold Wilson. Birk's insistence that King be sacked and that Cudlipp replace him as chairman was significant for the resulting transfer of power. In his youth Birk had reacted against his parents' religious orthodoxy and had become a member of the Jewish Reform community. However, in later life he returned to Orthodoxy and held a number of influential positions in Jewish life within Britain, sitting from 1956 as a director of the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span> (and from 1987 as chairman of its board), and as chairman of the Jewish Welfare Board; he was also a governor of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem. At the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> he remained an influential, though behind-the-scenes, figure until the group's takeover by Robert Maxwell in 1984. He died at Hammerson House, a residential care home in Bishops Avenue, Finchley, London, on 3 July 2004. He was survived by his two children.<br>
