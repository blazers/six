<span class="headword">Porter,  Sarah Ricardo</span>  (1790&#150;1862), <span class="occ">writer on education</span>, was born in London on 22 December 1790, the fifteenth child and sixth daughter of Abraham Ricardo and Abigail Delvalle Ricardo, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23471/', "David Ricardo")</script>. She married a schoolfriend of her brothers, the statistician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22567/', "George Richardson Porter (1792&#150;1852)")</script>, with whom she shared a talent for mathematics and a concern for education. Her writing was influenced by her experience with her own children. She died at West Hill, Wandsworth, London, on 13 September 1862.<br>
<br>Sarah Porter published her first book, <span class="italic">Alfred Dudley, or, The Australian Settlers</span>, in 1830: in its preface, as &#145;the Author well knows that young people do not read Prefaces&#146;, she assured &#145;judicious parents&#146; that the information presented through the fiction was drawn from a reputable source, Robert Dawson's <span class="italic">The Present State of Australia</span> (1830). The name Dudley reappeared as the fictional family's name in her next and more noteworthy book, <span class="italic">Conversations on Arithmetic</span> (1835). The book drew heavily upon her own practice to benefit mothers and others with limited mathematical experience; influenced by Locke, it was intended &#145;not so much to make [children] mathematicians as to make them reasonable creatures&#146;. Thus, Porter resisted the temptation to lay down rules, at least until the principles underlying particular problems had been explored and explained. When she published a revision of <span class="italic">Conversations</span> as <span class="italic">Rational Arithmetic</span> in 1852, she replaced the exploratory and often amusing dialogue with &#145;direct teaching and rules&#146; as more suitable for its intended use in schools as well as in private instruction.<br>
<br>Like at least four of her brothers, Porter was a member of the Central Society of Education, an association founded in 1836 as a corrective, in part, to the older societies dedicated to the education of the people, the British and Foreign School Society and the Anglican National Society. The Central Society differed from these in promoting the educational theories and practices of such continental authorities as Fellenberg, rather than the monitorial system and rote learning which had been the norm, and in arguing for a secular rather than a religious system of schools and instruction. Much of the Central Society's energies were dedicated to the collection, classification, and diffusion of information concerning the education of all classes &#145;in order to learn by what means individuals may be best fitted in health, in mind, and in morals to fill the stations which they are destined to occupy in society&#146;. Its chief means to this end was to bring a &#145;scientific character&#146; to the theory of education, in part through the statistical work of George Porter, who also served on the society's committee of management.<br>
<br>Sarah Porter's essay &#145;On infant schools for the upper and middle classes&#146;, published in the society's second collection of papers (1838), argues that what is good for working-class children is good for upper- and middle-class children: her recommendations owe much to Locke, but she acknowledges that it is the teacher, not the system, that is crucial to the success of early childhood education. This theme is worked out in more detail in her essay published by the society as one of five in <span class="italic">The Educator: Prize Essays on the Expediency and Means of Elevating the Profession of the Educator in Society</span> (1839); it echoes her mathematics books in its call for &#145;reflecting&#146; teachers who act from principles, rather than unreflecting ones who only follow the rules of a system. In line with the generally liberal aims of the Central Society of Education, Porter expresses the hope that education will be a power for good&#151;an individual as well as a social good&#151;though she fears it may be &#145;romantic to suppose that the whole can be made a thinking people&#146;, which was the purpose of both her theoretical and her practical writing on education.<br>
