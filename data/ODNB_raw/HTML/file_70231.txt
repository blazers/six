<span class="headword">Harrison,  John  Heslop-</span>  (1920&#150;1998), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born on 10 February 1920 at 181 Abingdon Road, Middlesbrough, North Riding of Yorkshire, one of the three children of John William Heslop Harrison (1881&#150;1967), a distinguished scientist who held posts variously at the universities of Newcastle upon Tyne and Durham in both zoology and botany, and his wife, Christian Watson (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Henderson).<br>
<br>Heslop-Harrison was educated at Chester-le-Street grammar school and King's College, University of Durham, where he read botany, zoology, and chemistry. In 1941, before being able to embark on an academic career, he was called up for war service in the army. He spent time on Orkney working on the development of radar, and later was attached to the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force, where he helped in the evaluation of the technical capabilities of the German armed forces. In 1945, at the end of the war, he returned to King's College as lecturer in agricultural botany, and then a year later moved as lecturer in botany to the Queen's University of Belfast, with a special interest in the reproductive physiology of plants; he obtained his PhD degree there. On 23 September 1950 he married Yolande Massey (<i>b</i>. 1918/19), a university lecturer in botany at Newcastle.<br>
<br>A move to University College, London, allowed Heslop-Harrison to develop research interests in modern plant systematics, and he became reader in taxonomy in 1953. In the following year he returned to Belfast to take up the chair of botany, where he remained until 1960. He was then appointed to the Mason chair of botany at Birmingham, where he was active in the establishment of the school of biological sciences, the first of its type in the country, with the integration of teaching and research across several biological disciplines. At Birmingham, too, he developed the then relatively new technique of electron microscopy, especially its application to plant reproductive studies.<br>
<br>Between 1967 and 1971 Heslop-Harrison was based at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He took whatever opportunities were open to him within the United States and internationally to promote his concerns about the erosion of biological diversity, and the importance of fostering environmentally sensitive agriculture.<br>
<br>In 1971 Heslop-Harrison returned to Britain as director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, a remarkable and significant appointment in many ways. Kew had long been a pre-eminent centre of taxonomic studies, albeit largely traditional, but with Heslop-Harrison as director it was suddenly at the forefront of the &#145;new taxonomy&#146;. At Kew he worked closely with his wife. He gradually found central government, then responsible for the funding of Kew, frustratingly unwilling to support fully his plans for the new direction in which he wished the Royal Botanic Gardens to go. Uniquely for a Kew director, therefore, he resigned in 1976 to become Royal Society research professor at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, based at the Welsh Plant Breeding Station. Freed of much administrative labour, there the Heslop-Harrisons made important and extensive studies of the fertilization process in plants and the interaction of the pollen tube with the female floral parts, work that was technically exacting as well as significant. Heslop-Harrison remained there until his formal retirement in 1985, when he continued his studies, at first in Aberystwyth and later from the basement of his home in Leominster.<br>
<br>Heslop-Harrison's legacy in the understanding of the flowering process and reproductive physiology in plants is immense, his publication list voluminous, and his students legion; many subsequently progressed to senior professional posts themselves. He had an immense grasp of the entire subject of botany, both modern and historic. He possessed the rare attributes of being a brilliant lecturer and highly gifted technically. His contributions were formally recognized in many ways, most notably with his election to fellowship of the Royal Society in 1970 and receipt of its Darwin medal in 1976 and its royal medal in 1996. Among other awards were the Linnean medal for botany from the Linnean Society in 1976, the Navashin medal of the Komarov Institute of the USSR Academy in 1991, the Erdtman international medal for palynology in 1971, and honorary doctorates from the universities of Belfast, Bath, Edinburgh, and Hull.<br>
<br>Heslop-Harrison was a big man, tall and physically very imposing, and in his company there was never any doubt that one was in the presence of a powerful and forceful intellect. Notwithstanding this, he was a man of much humour, who always had time for students, no matter how junior or inexperienced, and was always willing to listen carefully to the other's argument before making a decision or reaching a conclusion. John Heslop-Harrison died on 7 May 1998 following a heart attack at his home, The Pleasaunce, 137 Bargates, Leominster, Herefordshire; his wife survived him.<br>
