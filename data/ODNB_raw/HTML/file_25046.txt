<span class="headword">Seguin,  Arthur Edward Sheldon</span>  (1809&#150;1852), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 7 April 1809 in London, the son of (Ralph) Arthur Seguin (1781/2&#150;1865), who served as secretary at Her Majesty's Theatre for over fifty years, and was described as &#145;the Metternich of English Opera, the great negotiator between managers and prima donnas&#146;  (<span class="italic">New York Herald</span>, 7 Nov. 1844). He was of Irish descent; Seguin's mother was Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smythe. Known by the forename Edward, the younger Seguin was educated at the Royal Academy of Music, from which he narrowly escaped dismissal in 1827 for some breaches of discipline. In that year he attracted attention with his fine singing at a students' public concert in the Hanover Square Rooms. He first appeared in opera as Basilio in Rossini's <span class="italic">The Barber of Seville</span> at the first dramatic performance of the Royal Academy on 8 December 1828. He sang at the Exeter festival in 1829. On 6 November 1830 he took the part of Ismael in Lord Burghersh's opera <span class="italic">Catherine</span>, <a href="#cosubject_25046">Ann Childe [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who subsequently became his wife, filling the title role. In 1831 he sang Polyphemus in Handel's <span class="italic">Acis and Galatea</span> at the Queen's Theatre, Tottenham Street, under the management of George Macfarren, the elder. The following year Seguin was engaged at Drury Lane, where he appeared as Count Rodolfo in <span class="italic">La sonnambula</span> with Maria Malibran. He sang at Covent Garden (1833&#150;4, 1835&#150;7), and was extremely successful with his performance of Masetto in the revival of Mozart's <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span> in February 1833. From 1835 to 1838 he appeared at the King's Theatre and at Drury Lane. On 13 August 1838 he created the part of the Baron in George Macfarren's <span class="italic">The Devil's Opera</span> at the English Opera House.<br>
<br>Immediately afterwards Seguin, his wife, and their three children left England for America, where he made his d&eacute;but as the Count in W. M. Rooke's <span class="italic">Amilie</span> on 15 October at the National Theatre, New York. In America he formed an opera company, the Seguin Troupe, which toured successfully in both the United States and Canada. American newspapers reported that Seguin was elected a chief by an Indian tribe in August 1840, and given the name Wach n-Wachn, which signified an aquatic bird possessing a strong and harmonious note. He died in White Street, New York, on 13 December 1852. His younger brother William Henry (1814&#150;1850) was a bass singer; their sister, Elizabeth Eleanor, a soprano, was the mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21264/', "Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa")</script>.<br>
<br>Seguin's wife, <a name="cosubject_25046"></a><span class="headword">Ann  Childe Seguin</span>  (1811&#150;1888)<span class="occ"></span>, was born in London on 20 April 1811, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5294/', "James Waring Childe (1780&#150;1862)")</script>, miniature painter, and his wife Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Banfield, of Bath. She was Seguin's fellow pupil, and subsequently a sub-professor at the Royal Academy of Music. The couple were married about 1831. They sang together at the Westminster Abbey festival in 1834. She made her Covent Garden d&eacute;but in 1835 as Marcellina in <span class="italic">Fidelio</span>, supporting Malibran. She was second principal soprano at the King's Theatre for two or three seasons, and in 1837 she sang the part of Donna Anna at Drury Lane in the English version of <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span>. In America she continued to perform until her husband's death. After that she devoted herself to teaching music in New York, where she died in August 1888.<br>
