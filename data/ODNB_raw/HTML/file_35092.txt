<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Moore,  Temple Lushington</span>  (1856&#150;1920), <span class="occ">architect</span>, the eldest son of Captain George Frederick Moore (1818&#150;1884) and his wife, Charlotte (1826&#150;1922), youngest daughter of John Lushington Reilly, of Scarvagh House, co. Down, was born on 7 June 1856 at Tullamore, King's county, Ireland, where his parents were then living. His early education was at Glasgow high school, where his father, now a major, had become staff officer of pensioners for the army. In 1872 the boy, whose health was delicate, was sent as a pupil to the Revd Richard Wilton of Londesborough, Yorkshire. Three years later he was articled to the architect George Gilbert Scott junior, son of Sir George Gilbert Scott. Although nominally beginning in independent practice in 1878, Moore's career remained closely bound up with Scott for several years. Scott's mental health deteriorated and he became incapable of effective work for long stretches. Moore, therefore, faithfully completed many of his master's commissions, including the major church of St Agnes, Kennington, London, and all the income from such work went to support Scott's wife, Ellen, and her family. Moore's own career began slowly, partly because of these difficulties, and partly because it took time for his style and talents to mature.<br>
<br>In 1884, after a long engagement, Moore married Emma Storrs Wilton (1856&#150;1938), elder daughter of his former tutor. Family and clerical contacts in Yorkshire remained important to Moore and explain many commissions, especially during his early career. By about 1890 his reputation was growing rapidly and over the next twenty-five years he built some forty churches which established him as England's leading ecclesiastical architect from the mid-Edwardian years. As an Anglo-Catholic himself, much of his work was for high-church clients who required beautiful settings and fine furnishings for worship. He was a very private man who lived for his family and architecture and never sought the limelight by aggressive self-promotion or involvement in architectural institutions or politics. He chose to remain based in London but much preferred working at home than doing so from his office. Gradually it became apparent that Moore's artistic destiny was not to preserve an attenuating tradition but to bring to maturity a development which otherwise would have remained incomplete. The following are the more important new churches he designed: All Saints', Peterborough (1886&#150;1901); St Peter's, Barnsley (1891&#150;1911); Sledmere church, Yorkshire (1893&#150;8); St John's, Hendon, Middlesex (1895&#150;6); Carlton in Cleveland church, Yorkshire (1896&#150;1900); St Mark's, Mansfield (1896&#150;7); St Cuthbert's (1897&#150;1901) and St Columba's, Middlesbrough (1900&#150;02); All Saints', Tooting Graveney, London (1904&#150;6); St Wilfrid's, Lidget Green, Bradford (1904&#150;5); St Wilfrid's, Harrogate (1904&#150;14); St Luke's, Eltham (1906&#150;7); St Margaret's, Leeds (1907&#150;9); St Anne's, Royton, Lancashire (1908&#150;9); Uplands church, Stroud, Gloucestershire (1908&#150;10); Canwell church, Staffordshire (1910&#150;12); St James's, Clacton-on-Sea, Essex (1912&#150;13); and All Saints', Basingstoke (1915&#150;17). Moore designed the Anglican cathedral at Nairobi (1917&#150;18), the chapel at the Bishop's Hostel, Lincoln (1906&#150;7), and the nave of Hexham Abbey (1907&#150;8) and Pusey House, Oxford (1913&#150;18). He also carried out numerous church restoration and furnishing schemes.<br>
<br>Although primarily a church architect, Moore undertook over seventy commissions for other building types (especially during the early part of his career). Major works include South Hill Park, near Bracknell, Berkshire (1891&#150;8), the &#145;Eleanor Cross&#146; at Sledmere, Yorkshire (1896&#150;9), and the Hostel of the Resurrection, Leeds (1907&#150;28). He also gained great credit from his contemporaries for his restoration of Treasurer's House (1897&#150;1901) and of St William's College (1902&#150;11) at York. Among his miscellaneous works are some schools, parsonages, and parish halls, the court house at Helmsley, and a hospital at Woodhouse Spa.<br>
<br>Moore's work, like that of the younger Scott, is important in the history of English architecture not only for its beauty but also for its development of the Gothic revival. Assuming an essential incompatibility between medieval architecture and modern life, A. W. N. Pugin, the pioneer of the Gothic revival, had striven to lead people back to medievalism; his successor, like Sir Gilbert Scott, had striven to bring medieval architecture up to date. The school identified with the name of the younger Scott and pioneered by G. F. Bodley held that both of these processes were unnecessary, that the Gothic style was still the most natural medium for the church architect to employ, and that its resumption meant not the adoption but the abandonment of a restrictive convention. Moore, even more than Bodley and Scott, seems to have thought and built in Gothic without any effort at stylism. His designs are indistinguishable in kind from those of the middle ages, and as independent of exact precedent as they. The limits of his style were the limits of his predilections: his buildings, although purely Gothic, appear to have been designed with no constraint save that of his vigilant good taste. Everything depends, not on elaborate detail and ornament, but on subtle planning, fine vistas, and what a contemporary critic called &#145;good proportion and sweetness of line&#146;  (<span class="italic">Building News</span>, 82, 1902, 657). The church of St Wilfrid, Harrogate, and that of St Peter, Barnsley, show Moore's style at its grandest; the village churches of Carlton in Cleveland and Canwell reveal it at its most intimate and delicate.<br>
<br>Moore died at his home, 46 Well Walk, Hampstead, on 30 June 1920 and was buried at St John's, Hampstead. He had intended that his only son, Richard, who had been articled to him about 1913, should take over the practice. However, Richard died in 1918 when the SS <i>Leinster</i> was torpedoed, and the following year Moore took on his son-in-law Leslie Thomas Moore (1883&#150;1957). The partnership was known as Temple Moore and Moore, and Leslie continued in practice, often carefully adding to and furnishing the older man's works, until the mid-1950s. Among Temple Moore's pupils was, from 1899, Giles Scott, the son of his master.<br>
