<span class="headword">Bonde,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1530), <span class="occ">Bridgettine monk and author</span>, came from Northumberland and was educated at Cambridge University, where he taught before entering the Bridgettine monastery of Syon Abbey, Middlesex. At Cambridge he obtained his BA in 1500&#150;01 and MA in 1503&#150;4. In that year he became a fellow of Queens' College, and also <i>lector philosophiae</i>. In 1506&#150;7 he transferred to Pembroke College, where he was junior treasurer in 1507&#150;9. A contemporary fellow was John Fewterer, who later became confessor-general at Syon. In 1509&#150;10 Bonde was appointed university preacher while studying for a higher degree, which was unfinished when he entered religion.<br>
<br>Syon Abbey, the only English house of the order founded by St Bridget of Sweden in 1370, was a centre of religious reform from its foundation in 1415, and later of orthodox opposition to the Reformation. Bonde joined a dynamic group of highly educated priest brethren dedicated to serving the sacramental needs of a larger body of sisters, and to evangelizing through preaching and spiritual direction. Their aims were furthered by the use of the new medium of printing to disseminate a range of devotional books and pamphlets. Written in English, not Latin, these were aimed at an audience of educated lay people, and the religious, especially women. Bonde's two books contributed to the collective reputation of the house. The first, <span class="italic">The Directory of Conscience</span> (1527; <span class="italic">A Devote Treatyse</span>, 1534), was aimed at those in the early stages of religious life, and was also suitable for devout lay people. It addressed the problem of scrupulosity, over-anxious adherence to regulations through fear of God, common among the religious, and also melancholy, or depression. It offered clear guidance and practical remedies. The use of the holy name of Jesus, simple prayers, and meditations on his passion, were characteristic of the <i>devotio moderna</i>. The skill with which information was structured, the use of standard frames of reference, such as the seven deadly sins and examples from scripture and saints' lives, made it suitable for oral transmission, as well as private reading. The text itself contained numerous references to the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and writings of the doctors of the church, including more recent authorities Gerson and Nidar.<br>
<br>Bonde's <span class="italic">The Pylgrimage of Perfection</span> (1526; 2nd edn, 1531) was likewise heavily referenced and illustrated with devotional woodcuts. A far more complex work, it was written primarily for those with pastoral responsibility for others. It covered the same topics as elementary catechisms, but in great detail, including expositions of basic prayers, the mass, and the passion of Christ. In anticipation of St Ignatius, the Christian journey was divided into seven days, symbolic of spiritual progression. Bonde was concerned to describe methodically the path from the active religious life to the contemplative, which was reached on the sixth day. On the seventh day extracts from St Bernard and Herphius conveyed something of the joy of contemplation. In its orthodoxy and lack of innovation it refuted Lutheran heresies, and has been described as a &#145;<i>summa</i> of late medieval teachings on the religious life&#146;  (Rhodes, 22).<br>
<br>Bonde's written works contain all that is known of him as a personality. They reveal a man of great intellectual ability and deep knowledge of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and church doctors, an advanced spiritual practitioner, compassionate, and with an astute understanding of human psychology. The clarity with which he conveyed information attests to his vocation as preacher and teacher. Most of the twenty-nine works he bequeathed to the Syon brothers' library were by Thomas Aquinas, or were bibles and <span class="roman">Bible</span> commentaries. They show a somewhat old-fashioned orthodoxy, although the emphasis on biblical scholarship, advocated by St Bridget, was also fundamental to protestant Christianity. Bonde died at Syon Abbey on 18 July 1530 (and was buried there), before the abbey's stand against the English Reformation.<br>
