<span class="headword">Barton,  John</span>  (1836&#150;1908), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born at East Leigh, Havant, Hampshire, on 31 December 1836, sixth of the nine children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37160/', "John Barton (1789&#150;1852)")</script> and his wife, Fanny (<i>d</i>. 1842), daughter of James Rickman. After schooling at Bishop Waltham and at Cholmondeley School, Highgate, Middlesex, he entered Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1855, to read mathematics. He was a hardworking and laconic but sociable giant of a man, and an avid botanist, mountaineer, and hillwalker; he was also an invigorating secretary of the university's Church Missionary Union, none of which left much time for his studies. In 1859, after last-minute cramming, he graduated with honours in mathematics and natural science. In the same year he was accepted as a missionary by the Church Missionary Society (CMS), in March, and on 5 May he married Catherine Frances, daughter of Edward Wigram and sister of Frederic Wigram honorary secretary of the CMS. Of frail health, she died in May 1860, followed soon afterwards by their two-month-old daughter.<br>
<br>In December 1860 Barton arrived in Calcutta. He was ordained priest in the following February and posted up-country to superintend the CMS college at Agra and the nearby orphanage at Sikandra. In May 1863 he was transferred to the mission school at Amritsar. Here he met Emily Eugenia, second daughter of the Revd Charles Boileau Elliott; they married at Ludhiana on 12 October 1863. In March 1865, after a year's furlough, Barton became principal of the CMS's new university college at Calcutta. He had originally doubted the worth of missionary colleges but was now convinced that the prestige and respect they generated were crucial in persuading Indians to listen to what missionaries had to say.<br>
<br>Barton was plagued by dysentery and every hot season he left Calcutta for southern India, the foothills, or Burma. He returned to Britain in 1869 to recoup his health, and he worked as secretary under Henry Venn at Church Missionary House before returning to India in the autumn of 1871 as secretary of the CMS's Madras mission. Barton was neither doctrinaire nor conservative in matters of ritual and his two tours of the Madras missions, combined with his earlier travels, convinced him that church union was the only way forward for India's Christian community.<br>
<br>Barton left Madras in 1876. In 1877, with six sons and two daughters all in need of an education, he accepted the living of Holy Trinity, Cambridge, where he remained until 1893, with the exceptions of a four-month deputation to Ceylon in 1884 and a year as acting bishop at Tinnevelly in Madras in 1889. At Cambridge he was a founder council member of Ridley Hall Theological College, and a hugely successful popularizer of missionary endeavour; ninety-seven undergraduates were accepted as missionaries during his time in Cambridge.<br>
<br>Barton turned down the bishoprics of Travancore (in 1889), Tinnevelly (in 1889), and Japan (in 1893). In 1893 he became chief secretary of the Church Pastoral Aid Society, a body which handed out grants-in-aid to clergy needing extra curates and lay preachers. The job bristled with the politics of personality, and additionally Barton was too liberal for many of the evangelicals on his committee. He resigned in 1899. His active retirement was curtailed by a stroke in 1905 and he died at his home, Moorcroft, Weybridge, Surrey, on 26 November 1908, and was buried in the Weybridge parish churchyard on 1 December. A tablet and memorial window to him were placed in Holy Trinity Church, Cambridge.<br>
<br>Barton was survived by his second wife and eight children, one of whom, Cecil Edward Barton (1870&#150;1909), missionary in the Punjab, wrote&#151;but did not live to see published&#151;a memoir of his father (1910).<br>
