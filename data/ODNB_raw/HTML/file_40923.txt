<span class="headword">Chesser,  Eustace</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Isaac Chesarkie]</span>  (1902&#150;1973), <span class="occ">psychiatrist and social reformer</span>, was born on 22 March 1902 at 3 Dalkeith Road, Edinburgh, second son of Arthur Chesarkie, a jeweller, and his wife, Rebecca Solomon, whose families had fled Russian pogroms. He was educated at George Watson's School, Edinburgh, subsequently qualifying in medicine (LRCPEd, LRCSEd, LRFPS) at Edinburgh in 1926, by which time he had changed his surname to Chesser. His first marriage, to Rose Golda Morris (1904/5&#150;1960), daughter of Barnett Morris, took place in the same year, on 18 August. They had two children, a son (who also became a psychiatrist) and a daughter. Chesser spent some time in general practice in Cinderford and Manchester before moving to London in the early 1930s, where he took an extended sabbatical from medical practice, working for the London and Northern Medical Transfer Agency. As a clinical assistant at the Tavistock Clinic he underwent psychoanalysis, subsequently specializing in psychiatry, although his interpretation of Freudian concepts became increasingly liberal as he developed his own dynamic methods. He changed his name from Isaac to Eustace about 1937, and by 1940 was back in practice, first in Harley Street and subsequently in Wimpole Street, London.<br>
<br>In November 1940 Chesser published the first, and probably the most enduringly popular, of more than thirty books, <span class="italic">Love Without Fear: a Plain Guide to Sex Technique for Every Married Adult</span>, aimed at ameliorating the vast amount of matrimonial misery caused by sexual ignorance. It had already sold 5000 copies by 1942, when the director of public prosecutions proceeded against it for obscenity, and Chesser remarked when the summons was served, &#145;you have left it a long time&#146;. Instead of following the usual procedure of pleading guilty before a magistrate and paying a small fine, Chesser and his publisher chose to take the case before a jury, risking far heavier penalties. While Chesser presumably hoped to clarify the unsatisfactory state of the law on obscenity, there would have been unpleasant professional repercussions had he admitted his work to be obscene. An important concession was gained that the book should be judged as a whole rather than on the basis of isolated &#145;objectionable&#146; passages. Chesser and his witnesses made a good case, but the outcome owed much to the summing up by the judge. After less than an hour the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Chesser's medical qualifications were clearly a significant factor, and although he was personally vindicated the general state of the law remained unchanged until the 1959 <span class="roman">Obscene Publications Act</span>.<br>
<br>Chesser's other works are too numerous to mention in full; he also wrote extensively in the press and was a frequent radio and television broadcaster. He was the central moving spirit of the survey <span class="italic">The Sexual, Marital and Family Relationships of the English Woman</span> (1956). In an article for the British Medical Association annual booklet <span class="italic">Getting Married</span> (1959), &#145;Is chastity outmoded? Outdated? Out?&#146;, he queried conventional restrictions and suggested that pre- and extra-marital sex ought to be individual choices. The subsequent &#145;Doctors in free love storm&#146; in the press led the association to withdraw the entire booklet, though 20,000 copies had already been distributed.<br>
<br>Chesser championed many sexually progressive causes, openly supporting abortion law reform and the decriminalization of homosexuality when both were taboo. Though his battles were mainly fought during the 1950s and 1960s, his associates in the Society for Sex Education and Guidance during the 1940s reveal roots in inter-war sex reform circles. Besides arguing the theoretical necessity of abortion law reform he took advantage of the loophole supplied by the <i>R. v. Bourne</i> judgment (1938) to provide abortions at a nursing home in the Cromwell Road. In 1965 he admitted in an interview that &#145;the money played a bigger part&#146; in earlier years than following his success as an author  (Ferris, 194).<br>
<br>Chesser discarded the Jewish faith of his upbringing in favour of humanism, and supported voluntary euthanasia. A rebel, enemy to authority and unthinking conventional attitudes, Chesser's candour and hatred of hypocrisy sometimes embarrassed, but friends paid tribute to his passionate interest in human affairs, a power, warmth, and radiance &#145;as enriching as they were unforgettable&#146;, and &#145;kindness and generosity beyond measure&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 29 Dec 1973). Chesser's wife died in 1960 and he married Sheila Blayney-Jones in 1961. In 1969 he suffered a serious illness which left him incapacitated for the rest of his life, although in 1972 he appeared as an expert witness in an obscenity trial. He died on 5 December 1973 at his home, 17 Wimpole Street, Marylebone, London, and was survived by his second wife.<br>
