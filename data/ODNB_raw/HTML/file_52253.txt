<span class="headword">Soper,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1459), <span class="occ">administrator and merchant</span>, was the son of Robert and Clemency Soper. The family may have been connected with Salisbury: a John Soper traded with that city, and William himself had a house there <i>c</i>.1445; another possible place of origin is the area round Totnes in Devon. Soper was probably apprenticed in Southampton, where he is recorded as town steward in 1410, and for which he sat regularly in parliament, being returned thirteen times between May 1413 and February 1449. In 1413 he was appointed collector of subsidy and other royal dues at Southampton, continuing as customer there for thirty years. Also in 1413, his <i>annus mirabilis</i>, he stepped onto the ladder of royal service after a vessel of his captured a Castilian vessel, which became the royal ship <i>Holy Ghost</i>. He made this prize over to the crown, and his future career as a royal official at Southampton, and especially in connection with Henry V's navy, may have started from that transaction. Soper was certainly a key figure in the revival of the English navy under Henry V. In 1416 he administered the building of the <i>Gracedieu</i>, <i>Falcon</i>, and <i>Valentine</i>, all at Southampton. The <i>Gracedieu</i> weighed 1400 tons, and was the largest and most impressive of King Henry's ships. Facilities for its building at Southampton under Soper, who was appointed surveyor of the king's ships at 1<i>s</i>. a day in 1418, contributed to the creation of a dockyard workshop, which included a forge and storehouse costing &pound;200 and made of ragstone and &#145;holyngston&#146;. Southampton effectively replaced Greenwich as England's principal naval base after 1420. Following active service in 1420 the <i>Gracedieu</i> came to Soper who managed it. The great ship was laid up at Hamble in 1432 and burnt out in 1439. Marine archaeology has shown it was 125 ft long and clinker-built. It was excluded from the sale of ships under Henry V's will.<br>
<br>On 3 February 1420 Soper became keeper of the king's ships. His surviving accounts, now at Greenwich, have been published, and record the details of naval administration, maintenance, and equipment of the years around 1420 in the context of the development of the Lancastrian navy and of Soper's life. However, he also undertook a number of other tasks on behalf of the government. These included holding inquisitions and musters, and being a verderer of the New Forest, where he went to live. Trade in his own right&#151;recorded from 1412, when the commodity was La Rochelle wine&#151;probably became relatively less significant after he obtained royal preferment in 1413. But in 1417 he sent wool to Pisa, and in 1419 to Spain &#145;and foreign parts&#146;. He owned the 140 ton <i>Julian of Hampton</i> in 1418, and was sending wine to the dean of Salisbury and to the king's house at Guildford as late as 1440. There is evidence that the Southampton town government was aware of developments in financial practice as early as 1441, and was in the forefront of bookkeeping practice in England by the end of the century. Soper may have been influential in this area, since he was handling financial instruments and letters of payment in the 1420s and 1430s.<br>
<br>With an annual income of &pound;50, Soper was one of the wealthiest men in Hampshire in 1436. He certainly had cordial relations with Luca di Maso degli Albizzi, who was captain of the Florentine galleys in 1429. Albizzi visited Soper's rich New Forest home at Newton Bury (now Bury Farm), Hampshire, and declared of the <i>Gracedieu</i> that &#145;in truth I have never seen so large and beautiful a construction&#146;  (Mallett, 259). His account of his visit provides a vivid view of the pleasures&#151;feasting, hunting, receipt of gifts&#151;which accompanied business with Soper. In 1436 Soper may himself have gone to north Italy on pilgrimage. He developed financial interests which may have included moneylending and banking, perhaps operating from properties he had in Southampton. This could help to explain his slackening interest in trade after 1413. He continued in royal service under Henry VI until 1442. Having become one of the new administrative squirearchy of late medieval England, he died in 1459 at his country house as William Soper esquire. His association with Southampton continued in death, as his will tells of his marble tomb at the town's Franciscan church. Recent excavations may have uncovered his remains, but not his tomb. He apparently left no children, though he married twice: first the pious, and perhaps older, Isabel, whose surname is unknown, and second, <i>c</i>.1438, his former mistress, Joan Chamberlain.<br>
