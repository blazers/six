<span class="headword">Sitaram Pande</span>  (<em>supp. </em>1795?&#150;1873<span class="mult">x</span>80?), <span class="occ">supposed army officer in India and autobiographer</span>, may not have existed. The authenticity of what purport to be his memoirs has been disputed, and if they are a work of fiction then so too is this article, which is largely based on them, and statements here about his life should be read in this light. Sitaram (also written Sita Ram) Pande was supposedly born, probably in 1795, in the village of Tilowee, in the Rae Bareli district of Oudh, the son of Gangadin Pande, a prosperous Brahman yeoman farmer who owned over 150 acres and was a man of importance in his village. Sitaram was educated by the family priest and became literate. Before 1857 the East India Company's Bengal army recruited its sepoys largely from Oudh Brahmans. In 1814 Sitaram's maternal uncle Hanuman, an infantry jemadar, visited Sitaram's parents and inspired him to become a soldier. He and Hanuman travelled together, having a narrow escape from thugs who joined their party, and reached Agra. There, in November, Sitaram enlisted in his uncle's unit, the 2nd battalion, 26th Bengal native infantry, and served in his uncle's company, the light company.<br>
<br>Sitaram served in the Anglo-Nepal War (1814&#150;16) and in the Pindari war (1817) against Pindari mounted bandits&#151;&#145;demons from the lowest hell&#146;  (Lunt, 36)&#151;and was wounded. His first promotion was to lance-naik. In 1818 he served with the 1st battalion, 25th regiment, at the siege of Asirgarh, and in the assault was wounded when a magazine exploded, killing his uncle and most of his company. His mother arranged his marriage, about 1818, to the daughter of a local landowner, but after the wedding he discovered that she was disfigured by smallpox. He served in the fighting against Maratha chiefs' Arab mercenaries, and in the attack on a fort, Ahunpoora, he rescued a beautiful girl from an Arab. She was the daughter of Makum Singh, a Rajput <i>thakur</i> (petty chief) in Bundelkhand, and about 1820 Sitaram made her his second wife.<br>
<br>In 1820 Sitaram joined a new unit, the Fategarh levy (later the 63rd and 64th Bengal Native Infantry). He served with the 63rd, part of Lord Combermere's army, at the siege and capture of Bharatpur (1825&#150;6) and later was promoted havildar. In 1838, as part of Lord Auckland's plan to restore Shah Shuja to power in Afghanistan, a British-subsidized, British-officered force was raised in India, known as Shah Shuja's levy, and Sitaram became a havildar in it. He served in the First Anglo-Afghan War, and in January 1842, on the disastrous retreat from Kabul, was wounded, captured, and then sold as a slave in Kabul. He later escaped to India, reaching Ferozepore in October 1843, and returned to the 63rd. He served in the first and second Anglo-Sikh wars (1845&#150;6, 1848&#150;9) and in 1847 was promoted jemadar. In 1855 he served against the Santal uprising in Bengal.<br>
<br>In 1857 Sitaram warned his commanding officer of sepoy discontent, then went on leave and was in his village when the mutiny began. He remained loyal and was abducted by mutineers, then rescued by European irregular cavalry. He joined a new Punjab regiment, probably the 12th Punjab infantry, whose second-in-command, later commanding officer, was Captain (later Major-General) James Thomas Norgate (1824&#150;1894), and served with them against the mutineers in India and Nepal. His son was captured and executed as a mutineer: &#145;not for one moment did I consider requesting that his life should be spared&#151;that he did not deserve&#146;  (Lunt, 168). After the campaign in Nepal, Sitaram was promoted subedar, but he was then too old. He disliked the post-mutiny army, the Punjabis, and the changed attitudes of British officers. After criticism by officers he retired on a pension in 1860 and returned to his village. During his career he had been awarded six medals. Old and apparently disillusioned, he wrote his memoirs, probably in Adwadhi (western Hindi), comparing unfavourably the army that he had joined with that which he had recently left, criticizing Muslims, and asserting his own loyalty. In 1861 he sent the memoirs to Norgate. He died, presumably at Tilowee, probably between 1873 and 1880.<br>
<br>Norgate translated Sitaram's memoirs and published them in book form at Lahore in 1873; an Urdu translation was published in the same year. In 1911 an Urdu translation from Norgate's version was published as a language text for British officers, and used until 1947. A summary of the memoirs, with comment, was published in 1959 by Sir Patrick Cadell in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research</span>; and an edition by James Lunt was published in 1970 and has been used as a source by military historians. The memoirs contain many inaccuracies of names and dates, and are vague on the units in which Sitaram served, omitting regimental numbers. They were widely known and long accepted as genuine. After 1947, however, some questioned their authenticity, emphasizing their errors, the fact that Sitaram had too many changes of regiment, and that his adventures were &#145;too good to be true&#146;  (Mason, 208). It was alleged that the memoirs were a deliberate fraud by Norgate; J. A. B. Palmer wrote that they were &#145;of doubtful authenticity&#146;  (Palmer, 1). Others, however, including Cadell and Lunt, maintained that they were genuine. There is no conclusive evidence either for or against their authenticity but they may well be genuine, if sometimes inaccurate and possibly embroidered. If authentic then they are the only account published of an Indian sepoy's experiences during the first half of the nineteenth century, and as such they constitute an important historical source.<br>
