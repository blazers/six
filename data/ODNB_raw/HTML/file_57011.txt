<span class="headword">Keith,  Alexander</span>  (1895&#150;1978), <span class="occ">author and farmer</span>, was born on 18 August 1895 in The Square, Kintore, Aberdeenshire, the son of Alfred George Keith, chemist, and his wife, Janet Greig, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wishart. Janet Keith was the daughter of a local farmer and butcher, and brought up the family single-handed, running both the business and the local savings bank after her husband's early death. Alexander was educated at Kintore and Strichen parish schools, winning a bursary which enabled him to gain an honours MA in English from Aberdeen University in 1916. After brief experience of keeping the pedigree records of the Brucklay Castle herd of Aberdeen Angus, he joined the editorial staff of the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Daily Journal</span> (later <span class="italic">Press and Journal</span>) in 1917, and was assistant editor from 1929 until 1944. In 1943 he bought the farm of Eigie, by Balmedie, north of Aberdeen, which he worked until 1971, when he retired to Stonehaven in Kincardineshire. He specialized in breeding Aberdeen Angus cattle, and was secretary of the Aberdeen-Angus Cattle Society from 1944 to 1955. He was also a member of the council of the Aberdeen chamber of commerce in 1954, becoming president in 1957, and he travelled all over the world to promote the interests of both bodies. In 1967 Aberdeen University awarded him an LLD <i>honoris causa</i>, describing him as &#145;the universal man of the North-East&#146;  (<span class="italic">Aberdeen University Review</span>, 42). He married twice, first on 5 August 1922, Agnes Roberta MacDougall, and second on 16 January 1957, Lewella Agnes Mackay.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Keith was a prolific writer, publishing eight books, well over seventy articles, countless editorials and reviews, and almost a hundred BBC scripts and talks. The diversity of his subject matter was also great, ranging from local histories of banking, cattle-breeding, distilling, printing, and business, to works on Burns, Shakespeare, and Byron, together with studies of men and women eminent in the history of the north-east of Scotland, from poets to professors, soldiers to singers. He was one of the first to broadcast from the new BBC station in Aberdeen (2BD), established in 1923. He broadcast throughout his life, especially on horticulture and gardening, and spoke on air in America in the 1940s on behalf of the war effort.<br>
<br>In publishing, Keith's local fame derived from <span class="italic">The North of Scotland Bank Limited, 1836&#150;1936</span>, <span class="italic">The Aberdeen-Angus Breed: a History</span> (1958), <span class="italic">Families of the Aberdeen-Angus Breed</span> (1959), and his final history, <span class="italic">A Thousand Years of Aberdeen</span> (1972); it was increased by the posthumous publication of his collected essays from the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce Journal</span>, entitled <span class="italic">Eminent Aberdonians</span> (1984). &#145;A. K.&#146; became a legend in his own time, a member of clubs and associations with intriguing names such as the Sit Siccars, the Calm Soughers, the Club of Deer, and the Life Preserving Society, together with characters such as Charles Murray, David Rorie, J. B. Tocher, William Tawse, Lord Boyd Orr, and William Walker. He was highly popular as a man of charm and tact, common sense and worldly wisdom, of sheer readability and sense of fun (though he characteristically requested a private funeral).<br>
<br>Keith's international fame stemmed from <span class="italic">Last Leaves of Traditional Ballads and Ballad Airs Collected in Aberdeenshire by the Late Gavin Greig and Edited, with an Introductory Essay, Collations and Notes by Alexander Keith</span>, published by the Buchan [Field] Club in 1925. The title was doubly misleading: the contents represented only about 13 per cent of the huge collection (some 3500 songs) made in the decade before the First World War from a rich living tradition (which continued to thrive); it was amassed not only by Gavin Greig, an Aberdeenshire parish schoolmaster, but also by the Revd James Bruce Duncan, a local minister. They were overwhelmed by the size of their collection, and it was not ready for publication before their deaths (Greig's in 1914; Duncan's in 1917). Their papers went to Aberdeen University Library where they were examined by the great ballad authority William Walker. Greig and Duncan had scrupulously taken down everything their informants had given, from music-hall songs to great ballads, mingling &#145;dross&#146; with material of the highest quality. Walker did not recommend publication, but when friends in the Buchan Field Club later suggested publication of the songs of Bell Robertson (Greig's most prolific informant) Walker proposed that they print instead the annotated compilation of great &#145;traditional&#146; ballads in the collection, which Greig and Duncan had almost completed.<br>
<br>Too old at eighty-five for the task, Walker proposed the young Alexander Keith as editor, although other than publishing <span class="italic">Burns and Folksong</span> in 1922 (six articles originally suggested by Walker, mostly from Keith's weekly newspaper column, &#145;From a Scottish study&#146;), Keith had no experience in this field. He was guided and advised by Walker, who also chose the elegiac title and ensured that the introduction was used to rescue the battered reputation of his favourite, an earlier local collector, Peter Buchan. The sheer quality of Greig's and Duncan's material, both tunes and texts, brought international acclaim for <span class="italic">Last Leaves</span>, and lasting fame to Keith who, for the rest of his life, pursued an interest in folk-song, especially of the north-east. Keith died on 5 October 1978 in Woodcot Hospital, Stonehaven, Kincardineshire, and was buried in Stonehaven.<br>
