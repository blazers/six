<span class="headword">Ball,  Nicholas</span>  (1791&#150;1865), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was born in Dublin, the son of John Ball (1728&#150;1804), silk mercer of Dublin, and his wife, Mabel Clare, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bennett. Ball, a Catholic, was educated at Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, and at Trinity College, Dublin (1808&#150;12), where his contemporaries included Richard Sheil and W. H. Curran. Ball was called to the Irish bar in 1814, and afterwards spent two winters in Rome with his contemporary Thomas Wyse. Both young men saw a good deal of Cardinal Gonsalvi, secretary of state, and these visits were the subject of much controversy. It was alleged that the young men had sought to influence and support a scheme for the appointment of Irish Catholic bishops, subject to the veto of the English government. At a time when religious tensions were running high over Catholic emancipation, the visits fuelled the fires of suspicion. Ball took silk in 1830, and was admitted a bencher of the King's Inns in 1836. Valued as an equity lawyer, he obtained a lucrative practice in the rolls court and in the court of chancery, where his reputation was that of an acute, clear, and ready advocate. In 1836 Ball was elected member of parliament for Clonmel; in 1837 he was appointed attorney-general and in 1838 privy councillor for Ireland. He disliked parliamentary life, and was famous for his &#145;devotion to supper and silence in debate&#146;  (Ball, 261). He was glad to take refuge in a judgeship of the common pleas (Ireland), to which he was preferred in 1839, and which he held until his death. He was the second Roman Catholic barrister promoted to a judgeship after the passing of the <span class="roman">Emancipation Act</span>.<br>
<br>In 1817 Ball married Jane Sherlock of Butlerstown Castle, co. Waterford. They had seven children, the eldest of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1217/', "John Ball (1818&#150;1889)")</script>, became under-secretary of state for the colonies under Lord Palmerston's administration. Their son Thomas was a captain in the Dublin militia, and Nicholas and Alex Francis followed their father into the law. Of the three daughters, Jane married, and Anna and Mary became nuns. Their mother died in 1863.<br>
<br>As a judge, Ball was renowned for his sense of humour in court and there are many anecdotes of his quips and his imitations of witnesses. Ball was a sound and able lawyer, as well as being a sincere Roman Catholic, Liberal in his politics, and committed to the cause of Catholic emancipation. He held the office of judge of the common pleas until his death; he died at his home, 85 St Stephen's Green, Dublin, in January 1865, and was buried in the family vault under the pro-cathedral of Dublin.<br>
