<span class="headword">Coffin,  Robert Aston</span>  (1819&#150;1885), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic bishop of Southwark</span>, was born at Brighton on 19 July 1819. He was the son of Robert and Elizabeth Coffin. His father was a gentleman of great wealth who followed no particular profession. Coffin was sent to Harrow School in 1834. In 1837 he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, as a commoner, becoming a student in the following year. He read classics and graduated in 1840 with a third degree, graduating MA in 1843. In the same year he was ordained as an Anglican priest by Bishop Richard Bagot, and presented to the living of St Mary Magdalen, Oxford. The Tractarian movement had attracted him for some time, as he had been introduced to John Henry Newman on entering the university. He related later how, at that time, their relationship was like that of &#145;Father and Son&#146;  (Lubienski).<br>
<br>In 1845 Coffin resigned his preferment and was received into the Roman Catholic church at Prior Park College, Bath, on 3 December. He then became tutor to the family of Ambrose Phillipps De Lisle at Grace Dieu Manor near Leicester in the summer of 1846, on a one-year contract, travelling with them to Boulogne. In February 1847 he accompanied John Henry Newman and five other converts to Rome, where he went through the novitiate of the Oratory of St Philip Neri. He was ordained priest on 31 October 1847. From 1848 until 1849 he was superior of St Wilfrid's House, Cotton Hall, in Staffordshire, but became increasingly drawn to the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer following a visit to St Wilfrid's by their superior, Father Lans. Coffin left St Wilfrid's in late 1849, much to the annoyance of Newman, and in 1850 entered the novitiate of the Redemptorists at Trond in Belgium. He was professed on 2 February 1852 and returned to England to the Redemptorist house at Clapham, Surrey. He became rector of this house in 1855 and provincial superior in 1865. He was almost constantly employed for more than twenty years in attending retreats and missions throughout England, Wales, and Scotland.<br>
<br>In 1865 Coffin was in Rome and used his influence with Cardinal Reisach to secure the appointment of Henry Edward Manning as archbishop of Westminster in succession to Nicholas Wiseman. Following the death of Bishop James Danell in 1881 Coffin was chosen by Pius IX as the third bishop of Southwark. This appointment owed much to the influence of Manning, as Coffin was not one of the candidates chosen by the Southwark chapter. He tried to resist his appointment on grounds of age and infirmity, but was instructed to submit. He was consecrated bishop by Cardinal Henry Howard in Rome on 11 June 1882, and enthroned in Southwark Cathedral on 27 July of that year. However, his health was failing and after only two years he was forced to retire to the Redemptorist house of St Joseph at Teignmouth, Devon, where he died on 6 April 1885.<br>
<br>Coffin did not produce any original work of note but provided excellent English translations of the works of St Alphonsus Liguori. He was well known for his grand voice and persuasive preaching. His main achievement was to found several houses of the Redemptorist order in England, Scotland, and Ireland. Many of his brethren found him autocratic and domineering in manner. He hardly shone as a bishop but the ill health which he suffered for much of his episcopate disarms the critic.<br>
