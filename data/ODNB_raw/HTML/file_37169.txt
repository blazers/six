<span class="headword">Beaumont, Sir  Henry  de</span>  (<em>c.</em>1280&#150;1340), <span class="occ">baron</span>, was the younger son of Louis de Brienne, in right of his wife vicomte of Beaumont in Maine, and Agn&egrave;s, daughter of Raoul, vicomte de Beaumont. Through his great-grandfather, Alfonso IX, king of Le&oacute;n, he was distantly related to Edward I's first wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8619/', "Eleanor of Castile")</script>: a connection that may have promoted both the marriage of Beaumont's sister, Isabella, to Edward's supporter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28254/', "John de Vescy (d. 1289)")</script>, in 1279 or 1280, and Beaumont's own entr&eacute;e into English affairs in 1297, when he was made a knight of the royal household. He quickly came to be on close terms both with Edward himself, in whose Scottish wars he regularly served, and with his heir.<br>
<br>After the young Edward's accession in 1307 Beaumont rose rapidly. Joint warden of Scotland in 1308, he was summoned to parliament in 1309, and went on to receive extensive lands in Lincolnshire (augmented by his sister's lands in that county after her death in 1334) and the more contentious grant of the Isle of Man. The king's favour made him the special target of the reforming lords ordainer, who in 1311 called for the exclusion from court of both Beaumont and Isabella, the resumption of his grants from the king, and the transference of the custody of Man to &#145;a good Englishman&#146; (a phrase that reveals one reason for his unpopularity). These demands, however, were never implemented and Beaumont remained prominent at Edward's court until 1323. Regularly employed on missions abroad, he was also closely involved with the king's attempt to secure the bishopric of Durham for Henry's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1880/', "Louis de Beaumont")</script>, which led to the capture and ransoming of both the Beaumonts by Thomas, earl of Lancaster, the court's leading opponent, in 1317. He had his revenge in March 1322, when he was among the royalist army that defeated Lancaster at Boroughbridge. It may have been shortly after this that he served (so John Capgrave (<i>d</i>. 1464) says) in the Italian crusades launched against the enemies of Pope John XXII.<br>
<br>About 1310 Beaumont married Alice or Alicia Comyn (<i>d</i>. 1349), niece of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6047/', "John Comyn, seventh earl of Buchan")</script>, and heir to the Comyn earldom. This claim to a Scottish title and lands did as much as royal favour to determine the course of his career. The status that it gave him as a disinherited lord led him to oppose the Anglo-Scottish truce of 1323 and helped to persuade him to change his allegiance shortly afterwards. Although he was still sufficiently trusted to be appointed one of the young Edward's guardians when the prince was sent abroad to do homage for his father's French lands in September 1325, a year later he had become one of the leading supporters of Queen Isabella in her invasion of England.<br>
<br>After Edward II's deposition Beaumont was well rewarded for his altered loyalties by a large grant of lands in Leicestershire, but the Anglo-Scottish treaty of Northampton of 1328 led him once more into opposition. The treaty had promised the restoration of their Scottish inheritances to Beaumont and the other disinherited; but these promises were not kept. Beaumont became implicated first in the rebellion of Henry, earl of Lancaster, against the regime of Roger (V) Mortimer and Isabella in 1328&#150;9, fleeing to France after its collapse, and then in the inept conspiracy of Edmund of Woodstock, earl of Kent.<br>
<br>The coup of 1330, which finally overthrew the regime and established Edward III as king, opened a second successful phase in Beaumont's career. He returned to England and became the leading supporter of Edward Balliol in Balliol's attempt to secure the Scottish throne for himself and the restoration of their lands for the disinherited. In 1332 he shared Balliol's triumph at the battle of Dupplin Moor and in 1333 he was in the victorious army that defeated the Scots at Halidon Hill and restored Balliol to his throne after a brief Scottish rebellion. In the aftermath of the battle Beaumont was apparently made both earl of Moray and constable of Scotland by the new king. In 1334 he was captured and ransomed by the Scots, gaining his freedom in time to fight in Edward III's major Scottish campaign of 1335; but thereafter he shared in the general decline of English fortunes and interest in Scotland and never obtained recognition of his titles there. In July 1338 he went abroad to the Low Countries with Edward, and died there on 10 March 1340. According to Capgrave he was buried at Vaudey Abbey, a Cistercian house in Lincolnshire. He left a son and heir, John, aged twenty-two, a daughter, Katherine, who had married David Strathbogie, eleventh earl of Atholl, and his widow, who died in 1349. He was essentially an adventurer, who owed his rise to his service to three kings, his military vigour, his fortunate marriage, and his ability to press home the advantages that opportunity offered him.<br>
