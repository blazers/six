<span class="headword">O'Neill,  Hugh</span> <span class="st"> [Aodh &Oacute; N&eacute;ill]</span>, second earl of Tyrone  (<em>c.</em>1550&#150;1616), <span class="occ">magnate and rebel</span>, was born in the lordship of Tyrone, in the province of Ulster, the second son of Matthew O'Neill (Feardorcha), first baron of Dungannon (<i>d</i>. 1558), landowner, and his wife, Siobh&aacute;n (Joan), daughter of Constantine Maguire.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducationc15501568"></a>Early years and education, c.1550&#150;1568</h2>Matthew was heir designate, under English law, to the earldom of Tyrone, created in 1542 by Henry VIII for <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20767/', "Conn Bacach O'Neill")</script>, Gaelic lord of Tyrone. His eldest son, Brian O'Neill (<i>d</i>. 1562), was his heir in turn. As a younger son, Hugh O'Neill had but limited prospects, and these were further dimmed when an uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20785/', "Shane O'Neill")</script>, forcibly opposed the succession arrangement, contending, among other matters, that Matthew was no O'Neill but the illegitimate son of a blacksmith named Kelly. Shane's opposition led successively to the death of Matthew in 1558 and of Brian O'Neill in 1562. Moreover, following Tyrone's death in 1559, Shane became head of the O'Neills by Gaelic procedures, and forcefully opposed successive government efforts to impose a division of the lordship. The crown, at various points, considered meeting his demands, especially in 1562, when he visited Elizabeth I's court. However, these overtures came to nothing because Shane would not agree to any segmentation of the traditional O'Neill lordship, or to relinquishing authority over the <i>uir r&iacute;the</i> (&#145;subsidiary lords&#146;), who customarily paid a head rent to the ruling O'Neill. Thus, as negotiations failed, the crown decided the issue should be settled by force, and in 1567 Shane was killed. This outcome benefited the young Hugh O'Neill, who was recognized as third baron of Dungannon and prospective heir to the earldom.<br>
<br>It is unclear where Dungannon spent his childhood, but any fosterage with the O'Hagans and O'Quinns would have been brief since each of these septs identified with Shane O'Neill in the internecine struggle. It is probable that Hugh spent some of the time from 1556 to 1559 in the Dublin household of Sir Henry Sidney, which seems to have been followed by a period with the family of Giles Hovendon, an English soldier and settler in the Irish midlands, who leased property at Balgriffen, co. Dublin, assigned in 1542 to Tyrone to meet the costs of educating his heirs in English customs. This sequence is consistent with Sidney's claim of 1583 that he had &#145;bred&#146; Dungannon in his house &#145;from a little boy, then very poor of goods and full feebly friended&#146;  (Brewer and Bullen, 1575&#150;88, 339) and with the fact that Hovendon's sons were regularly described as foster brothers of Dungannon and remained among his most loyal supporters. Hovendon's tutelage had obviously ended by 1567 when Sidney brought Dungannon, together with the heirs of several Irish noble houses, to court.<br>
<br>Dungannon was necessary to this delegation, because Sidney sought authority to restructure the province of Ulster following Shane's death. This is probably the occasion that Thomas Gainsford had in mind when he described how Dungannon &#145;in his younger time trooped in the streets of London, with sufficient equipage and orderly respect&#146;  (Gainsford, 14). The crown probably met his expenses and enabled him to sue out his livery as baron of Dungannon. This installation indicates that the government saw a place for his brother Cormac Mac Baron and him in a remodelled Ulster. The primary objective was to expel the Scottish MacDonalds from the lands that they had occupied in the province, and to replace them with trustworthy English, Old English, and Gaelic proprietors. Then, to further assure stability, it was intended that the great O'Neill lordship should be parcelled out between various members of the ruling O'Neill family, the principal <i>uir-r&iacute;the</i> whose territories lay on the perimeter of the lordship, and the heads of the principal septs within the lordship on whose support O'Neill power was based. Dungannon stood to benefit from this scheme, although clearly the government did not intend to grant him all his grandfather's estates.<h2>
<a name="BaronofDungannon15681587"></a>Baron of Dungannon, 1568&#150;1587</h2>These various plans for Ulster explain why, after 1568, it made sense for crown officials, including Sir Nicholas Bagenal, marshal of the army, and his son, Henry Bagenal, who were settled at Newry, co. Down, to enable Dungannon to acquire further lands in south Armagh commensurate with his status as baron. Yet Dungannon lacked sufficient support because Sidney, who might have assisted him, was detained in England. When Sidney returned to his post in 1568 his scheme for the reform of Ulster had been compromised both because, in 1567, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20786/', "Turlough Luineach O'Neill")</script> succeeded Shane as the ruling O'Neill, and because the queen demurred at the prospective cost. It was not until 1572, after Sidney's departure, having surrendered the governorship to Sir William Fitzwilliam, that a systematic reform scheme for Ulster was launched. What emerged was fundamentally different both in theory and practice from anything previously contemplated, and these alterations involved a correspondingly different role for Dungannon. The theory underpinning the new scheme was the crown's ancient claim to all Ulster between the River Bann and the sea. It was now also asserted that the crown had title to the entire lordship of Tyrone through the attainder of Shane in the Irish parliament of 1569&#150;71. This put paid to Dungannon's hopes of claiming his grandfather's entire estates by hereditary right. Yet he now had the opportunity to extend his landholdings as this revised reform scheme for Ulster unfolded.<br>
<br>The essence of this scheme was that private individuals would restructure the eastern sector of the province along predetermined lines at their own expense, being compensated with grants of land and office. The two principal adventurers attracted by this opportunity were Sir Thomas Smith, principal secretary, and Walter Devereux, first earl of Essex. Essex hoped to secure control with a fort on the River Blackwater, just east of the customary centre of O'Neill power at Dungannon, and he anticipated that the garrison there would be provisioned by Lord Dungannon himself. The campaigns associated with Smith and Essex were among the bloodiest and most futile undertaken by English planters in early modern Ireland, but they were important to Dungannon because he became indispensable to them and his actions attracted the government's attention. He received favourable mention in dispatches sent by the colonizers to England. Essex placed him in charge of a company of cavalry, and was soon commending him for his forwardness in &#145;service&#146; as &#145;the only man of Ulster &hellip; meet to be trusted and used&#146;  (W. B. Devereux, ed., <span class="italic">Lives and Letters of the Devereux Earls of Essex &hellip; 1540&#150;1642</span>, 2 vols., 1853, 1.40&#150;42). Continued military exertions, including efforts to ensnare, or kill, Turlough Luineach O'Neill, earned Dungannon further commendation at a time when Essex was complaining of English gentlemen who deserted his cause, and of Old English landowners who refused to support it with either men or money. In return for his services he received military support from Essex to extend the lands he already held in Ulster, and was appointed captain of troops in government pay. These men were available to him for both private and official purposes, but he was called upon regularly between 1575 and the early 1590s to further various government missions with them, including providing assistance to Lord Grey in the suppression of the Desmond revolt.<br>
<br>These various actions helped Dungannon to familiarize himself both with English modes of warfare and with the methods by which impecunious crown captains advanced themselves in Ireland. During these years he also established lasting bonds with several English captains, while, in 1574, the queen advised Essex &#145;to use all good means to nourish the Baron of Dungannon's and [Calvagh] O'Donnell's good devotion towards us&#146;. This directive was taken by William Cecil, first Baron Burghley, lord treasurer, to mean that Dungannon &#145;be admitted to be earl of Tyrone according to his right&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1571&#150;5</i>, 508), although he also directed that this elevation be linked to a division of the previous Tyrone earldom among several claimants to royal favour. Probably Elizabeth and Dungannon both had this intervention in mind when she later described him as &#145;a creature of our own&#146;, and when he admitted to having been &#145;raised from nothing by her Majesty&#146;  (Morgan, 85, 94).<br>
<br>Despite Dungannon's good reputation in official circles, no specific lands were assigned to him beyond those he had seized with government connivance. However officials tolerated his further aggrandizements provided that they were at the expense either of Turlough Luineach O'Neill, whose power they wished to curb, or the MacShanes (the sons of Shane O'Neill), whose potential they feared. Concurrently, he received several appointments as lieutenant of areas of Ulster bordering the pale which were analogous to the seneschalships held by several army captains occupying Gaelic land beyond the pale's southern marches. If Dungannon's position then resembled that of the many English captains serving in Ireland, he was more adept in advancing his interests because his Ulster origins allowed him to operate within two competing worlds. Thus, besides seizing, with official support, larger parts of the O'Neill lordship, he was able to weaken his O'Neill rivals by inducing the subordinate septs to occupy the lands which he possessed and secured with soldiers under his command. This increased support from within the lordship then permitted Dungannon to aim still higher. Thus on successive occasions in 1579, 1583, and 1585, when Turlough Luineach O'Neill seemed about to die, Dungannon moved to succeed him as O'Neill, and subsequently justified his actions on the grounds that he wished to prevent the title, and the moral authority that it enjoyed, from falling to the crown's enemies. During these, and subsequent, years he also employed marriage as a device to forge, and break, alliances. He first married a daughter (probably called Katherine) of Brian Mac Phelim O'Neill of Clandeboye, a man whom he later alienated by supporting Essex's attempt to seize Clandeboye. This marriage produced several children but, at Dungannon's request in 1574, it was annulled on grounds of consanguinity. This left him free to marry, also in 1574, Siobh&aacute;n (or Joanna; <i>d</i>. 1591), daughter of Sir Hugh O'Donnell and his first wife. She, in turn, was repudiated in 1579, when Dungannon briefly contemplated marriage with a daughter of Turlough Luineach O'Neill, since restored to health, who then seemed agreeable to Dungannon's nomination as his successor. However, this alliance proved short-lived, and Dungannon welcomed back Siobh&aacute;n.They had two sons, Hugh (1585&#150;1609) and Henry O'Neill (1586?&#150;1617&times;21). Dungannon formed further strategic alliances within Gaelic Ulster by negotiating marriages for his sisters, and later, as they grew up, for his various daughters and sons, sometimes also taking hostages as sureties.<br>
<br>Dungannon's bids to claim the O'Neill lordship raised fears in Dublin that their intended agent in Ulster was less malleable than anticipated. However, some senior officials in Dublin and London were convinced by Dungannon's protestations of loyalty. He began his negotiation to secure the title and estate granted in 1542 to Conn O'Neill. His first move was to assume his place as Lord Dungannon in the Irish parliament of 1569&#150;71. His authority was increased further when Arthur Grey, fourteenth Baron Grey of Wilton, lord deputy (1580&#150;82), granted him additional powers of martial law. Dungannon's good standing in official circles earned him commendation. Such praise seemed to presage reward, but not until Sir John Perrot became lord deputy (1584&#150;8) was serious thought given to satisfying Dungannon's ultimate ambition, and then within the context of a plan for an enduring settlement in Ulster. Therefore, while Perrot agreed that Dungannon should be recognized as earl of Tyrone in the Irish parliament of 1585&#150;6, he also had Turlough Luineach O'Neill, whom he knighted, lead the procession when parliament convened. The letters patent confirming Dungannon as earl of Tyrone were issued on 10 May 1587.<h2>
<a name="EarlofTyrone15871595"></a>Earl of Tyrone, 1587&#150;1595</h2>Perrot intended to segment the former O'Neill lordship between separate proprietors holding their land in chief, with each landowner being required to reallocate his property among tenants-in-chief, and to support the appointment of sheriffs as a preliminary to the extension of English common law to all inhabitants. This implied that provincial administration would, as in Munster and Connaught, be supervised by a president maintained, together with supporting troops, by a composition rent imposed upon the lands of the new proprietors. This conflicted with Tyrone's plans. Although he probably saw himself as a loyal subject at this point, he argued persistently that he was entitled to everything held by his grandfather. Disagreement over this point delayed any final settlement, and in 1587 Tyrone was granted an audience at court to ventilate his views. These disclosed that his ambition cut across the intentions of both Perrot and Sir William Fitzwilliam, who dedicated himself to shiring Ulster during his final term as lord deputy (1588&#150;94). Perrot ultimately sought to divide the core O'Neill lordship into two units, with the earl excluded from the western portion granted to Turlough Luineach O'Neill, who was to become either earl of Omagh or earl of Clanoneill.<br>
<br>Before visiting court in 1587, Tyrone worked assiduously to pre-empt Perrot's plan by seizing lands intended for Turlough Luineach O'Neill and by undermining his authority and credibility as a ruler, usually in association with his O'Donnell allies to the west. Concurrently, he demonstrated his indispensability to the government: he opposed the MacShanes, who sometimes allied with Turlough Luineach O'Neill and frequently imported Scottish mercenaries, and he screened the pale by frequent proclamations of martial law. This fostered an uneasy relationship with the Irish privy council and, still more, with the various English captains and minor officials who hoped to benefit from Perrot's scheme. However Tyrone did succeed in consolidating his position within the O'Neill lordship, principally at the expense of Turlough Luineach O'Neill (now Sir Turlough O'Neill). Tyrone's court visit proved a spectacular success, principally because the Irish privy council was in turmoil, due to antagonism towards Perrot. Accordingly Elizabeth listened to the advice of her kinsman Thomas Butler, tenth earl of Ormond, who supported Tyrone. As a result, Tyrone's grant of land reflected his grandfather's grant in 1542 rather than circumstances following Shane's attainder.<br>
<br>The English government accepted Tyrone as their leading servant in Ulster, and this grant implied that his lordship would remain outside the authority of any new provincial president or minor official. What he obtained was little short of palatine jurisdiction such as Ormond enjoyed in co. Tipperary, and a further victory followed when an ensuing commission ruled that the country of Rory O'Cahan, principal <i>uir-r&iacute;</i> to the ruling O'Neill, was part of Tyrone's inheritance, and that the Fews in Armagh was integral to his lordship. Tyrone reciprocated in 1588 by executing many (perhaps over 500) survivors of the Spanish Armada. He maintained order in his lordship's southern marches and the pale borders; was relentless in pursuing and incarcerating the MacShanes who were still importing Scottish mercenaries into Ulster; and he justified fresh forays against Sir Turlough O'Neill on the grounds that he was conspiring with these enemies of the crown. He systematically increased his authority in Tyrone between 1587 and 1595.<br>
<br>If Tyrone was gaining ground against his traditional opponents he was incurring the resentment of an increasing number of officials in Ireland, especially in Ulster. Several of them voiced concern at his growing strength. Sir Henry Bagenal took the lead in trying to check and ultimately undermine Tyrone's power by forcing him to defend his position against officials more often than against his dynastic rivals. Bagenal succeeded his father as an Irish privy councillor and marshal of the army in 1590, and aspired to become the first president of Ulster. He was active in shiring the province, and also strove to exploit for his own ends and those of the captains and officials posted there the several commissions concerning Ulster affairs. Having failed to limit Tyrone's power he sought to convince successive lord deputies, senior administrators in England, and, ultimately, the queen, of the earl's treasonable intent. The first charge, endorsed by one of the MacShanes, was that Tyrone had in 1588 assisted, and sought help from, some of the Spaniards shipwrecked off the Ulster coast. He was then accused of importing Scottish mercenaries (which he never denied), and of treasonable correspondence with Philip II and James VI against the queen. Concurrently he was charged with pursuing a private vendetta against Sir Turlough O'Neill and the MacShanes contrary to the public interest.<br>
<br>When these various charges and insinuations failed, Bagenal sought Tyrone's conviction for treason on the grounds that he had had Hugh Geimleach O'Neill, the most forceful of the MacShanes, executed by martial law, against Fitzwilliam's specific instructions. Consequently, Tyrone was again called before the privy council in 1590, this time to clear his reputation. Burghley, advised by the disgraced Perrot, now believed that the privy council had an opportunity to reverse, or curtail, the grant of 1587. However, his fellow privy councillors remained unconvinced of Tyrone's treason, and some approved of Hugh Geimleach O'Neill's execution, if not of its manner. Therefore, in June 1590, the earl was permitted to return to Ireland, having agreed to divide his lordship into freeholds to facilitate the introduction of English common law. These developments show that traditional alliances were reversed, with officials now supporting Sir Turlough O'Neill, and the surviving MacShanes, against Tyrone. In desperation Tyrone sought a new alliance by marrying Mabel (1570/71&#150;1595), daughter of Sir Nicholas Bagenal of Newry, co. Down, and Carlingford, co. Louth, and his wife, Eleanor, and Sir Henry Bagenal's sister. Then, when this overture was spurned, Tyrone persuaded Mabel to elope with him. The two were married on 3 August 1591 by Thomas Jones, bishop of Meath, in the house of William Warren of Drumcondra, co. Dublin. An outraged Bagenal interpreted this as an affront to family honour: Tyrone had never been properly separated from his first wife, he contended, and he refused to pay his sister's dowry. This intensified the rivalry between the two men. However, just when Bagenal, with Fitzwilliam's apparent support, seemed to have restrained his rival, Tyrone's position was transformed by the unexpected escape of Hugh Roe O'Donnell from confinement in Dublin Castle.<br>
<br>O'Donnell&#151;Tyrone's former brother-in-law&#151;had been held hostage since 1587, and power within the O'Donnell lordship had slipped away to his O'Donnell rivals, who supported Sir Turlough O'Neill. However, following his return to Tyrconnell he quickly recovered control. Thereafter the ageing Turlough O'Neill remained friendless and a pensioner of Tyrone until his death in 1595. By 1592 Tyrone was master within his own lordship and, enjoying the support of the ruling O'Donnell, was, therefore, the most powerful man in Ulster.<br>
<br>If Tyrone had prevailed over Bagenal he was careful not to provide him with grounds for fresh charges. He complied with the terms agreed with the privy council in 1590, as he interpreted them. While claiming to have consented under duress, he none the less chose freeholders, and recommended his brother Cormac Mac Baron as sheriff of the entire jurisdiction. Officials welcomed these developments, but still demanded that two sheriffs be appointed, one for western Tyrone, to be styled co. Tyrone, where Cormac Mac Baron would serve, the other for co. Armagh. Tyrone's rooted objection to this could have been construed as unreasonable, but communal reaction to sheriffs&#151;usually rapacious military men&#151;in recently constituted counties in Ulster and north Connaught, suggests that he would have faced discord within his own lordship had he permitted officials from outside his control. However, while he defended his independence, marauding bands of English soldiers were imposed upon contiguous lordships, including those of his allies O'Donnell and Hugh Maguire, who confronted them. The resulting conflict rendered Tyrone's position more precarious, especially when some subordinates, including kinsmen, joined in what had become a popular cause. His professions of non-involvement were mocked by minor officials, who also alleged that he, with other Ulster lords, conspired with recently appointed Counter-Reformation Irish bishops to secure Spanish military support and to switch allegiance from Elizabeth to Philip. Senior officials were more circumspect, accepting Tyrone's protestations of good faith provided he induced those in arms to sue for pardon. Tyrone performed this service on two occasions&#151;an especially difficult assignment given the understandable distrust among Ulster lords about meetings with officials&#151;but received little gratitude. His loyalty was further tested when, in 1593, the lord deputy commanded him to accompany, and provide military assistance to, Bagenal in bringing Maguire to order. Once again Tyrone complied, so confounding the sceptics, was injured in the ensuing conflict, and received no praise, with Bagenal taking all the credit. This, and other snubs from Bagenal and Fitzwilliam, provoked Tyrone to complain that officials were bent on discrediting all Irish noblemen, that bribery was rampant within the political process, and that Bagenal was determined to trap him. These charges won Ormond's sympathy, and raised fears in London that Tyrone was about to join his kinsmen in rebellion. Therefore Bagenal was directed not to interfere in co. Tyrone, a commission was appointed to investigate the earl's grievances, and Fitzwilliam was replaced as lord deputy in 1594 by Sir William Russell. The English garrison at Enniskillen, co. Fermanagh, was attacked and routed by a force led by Maguire and Mac Baron. Undeterred, Tyrone, in August 1594, again demonstrated his loyalty by attending, without invitation, upon Russell in Dublin.<br>
<br>Obedience was no longer unconditional, however, and in 1595 Tyrone relayed a petition from O'Donnell and neighbouring Ulster lords that their lordships be exempted from recent innovations, including the stationing of garrisons, in return for payment of crown rent. Affronted by this, Elizabeth directed Russell to reclaim and consolidate government outposts in Ulster. Concurrently, the rebels laid siege to English garrisons, including Blackwater Fort within Tyrone's own lordship, forcing the government to send relief. Finally, Bagenal, with 1750 men, was attacked at Clontibret, co. Monaghan, and forced into retreat on his return journey from a relief expedition by a large, well-armed force commanded by Tyrone himself.<h2>
<a name="Reluctantrebel15951600"></a>Reluctant rebel, 1595&#150;1600</h2>Tyrone was proclaimed a traitor in English and Irish on 24 June 1595 at Dundalk, co. Louth. The issue of his father's questionable ancestry was now revived, this time by officials, but Tyrone gained alternate authority when, in September, he was chosen to succeed Sir Turlough O'Neill as ruling O'Neill. This supported Bagenal's contention that Tyrone had long conspired, along with his Ulster neighbours, with continental powers, and had orchestrated all recent disturbances. The evidence rather suggests that before 1595 Tyrone strove to work with the government, and was earnest in his demands for palatine jurisdiction to counteract a possible communal challenge to his authority mobilized around his brother Cormac Mac Baron. Also, he restrained his more impetuous associates, possibly on the understanding that he could negotiate a similar autonomy for their territories. Having failed in this, he was forced to choose between assisting Bagenal against his own supporters, or leading them against the marshal. He recognized that, without access to the queen, loyal service no longer won him favour and his statement that &#145;the Knight Marshal was the only man that urged&#146; him to his &#145;troubles&#146; seems convincing  (Meehan, 125).<br>
<br>Immediately before his break with the government Tyrone, like his associates, worked to strengthen his military capability. He did so by raising and training men from within his lordship, sometimes aided by the English soldiers serving with him, by hiring mercenaries from Scotland, and by purchasing weapons and munitions. His real achievement was in using the English &#145;butter captains&#146; to train his men in the &#145;perfect use of firearms&#146; with the result that those who previously were such &#145;rude soldiers&#146; that &#145;two or three of them were required to fire one piece&#146; were &#145;grown ready in managing their pieces and bold to skirmish in boggy and woody places&#146;  (Moryson, 12). Consequently, the government was taken by surprise when Tyrone first confronted them. He was cautious because he knew that he could not defeat a large, professional army under an able commander. Therefore, he endorsed the petitions, which O'Donnell, Maguire, and Cormac Mac Baron had previously made to Philip, asking him for a Spanish army of 6000 or 7000 men to pursue what was now described as a war to preserve Catholicism. Meanwhile Tyrone continued to isolate the crown garrisons in Ulster, and, as at Clontibret, occasionally attacked relief expeditions at carefully chosen sites.<br>
<br>Tyrone proceeded more cautiously than O'Donnell and negotiated with the government while seeking Spanish support. This suggests that he would still have settled for palatine status for himself and his neighbours. Doubtless he felt that Elizabeth could ill afford to confront him because of the war with Spain. He also seemed less enthusiastic than his confederates about proclaiming the Ulster insurrection a religious crusade and was suspicious of continentally educated Catholic bishops bent on recovering church property. He wanted to keep his options open and sought to strengthen his military position, while fighting a defensive war. Consequently, the years 1595&#150;8 were characterized by intermittent war, punctuated by truces and pardons, the spread of insurgency outwards from Ulster in 1596, when help from Spain was expected, and an intensification of government activity in 1597 after an anticipated Spanish force was destroyed by storm off Brittany. By then Thomas Burgh, fifth Baron Burgh, had succeeded Russell as lord deputy, with Sir Conyers Clifford becoming president of Connaught, following Richard Bingham's death. These commanders launched a joint offensive and recovered some Ulster positions, including Blackwater Fort. Seemingly, luck also favoured the government when another Spanish expedition was lost at sea in October 1597. However this was offset by the unexpected death of the government's most accomplished military leaders, Burgh and Sir John Norris. Tyrone's third wife died shortly before 30 December 1595. He married Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1618), daughter of Sir Hugh Magennis of Iveagh, co. Down, before 6 June 1597.<br>
<br>The Irish privy council was initially divided between suing for peace or continuing with the war, but eventually chose the latter: in August 1598 Bagenal received command of 4000 foot and 300 horse sent to relieve the Blackwater garrison, then besieged by Tyrone. On approaching the fort their way was blocked by a confederate army, under Tyrone's command, standing behind prepared ground. In the ensuing battle at Yellow Ford on 14 August the crown forces lost most of their cavalry and munitions while Bagenal and hundreds of his men were killed. Victory transformed both Tyrone's attitude and the character of the conflict. His reticence about religion and his caution were now cast aside for several reasons. First, the government position seemed precarious; second, his victory increased the possibility of tangible assistance from Spain, and many other dissidents in Ireland were now willing to accept his leadership. An indication of his enhanced reputation within Ulster is the appearance of a eulogy in verse, &#145;Cumam croinic Clainne N&eacute;ill&#146; (&#145;Let us compose a chronicle on Niall's descendants&#146;), by Dubhtach &Oacute; Duibhgeann&aacute;in, which praised Tyrone for his victory. The confederates overran most of Ireland, except for the pale, the walled towns, and fortified positions (which they could never capture without artillery), and parts of some lordships, notably those of Ormond, Thomond, and Clanricarde, whose earls remained loyal. Most spectacularly, the recently established Munster plantation collapsed before the assault of an expeditionary force sent by Tyrone. Concurrently the confederates increased their military capability, meeting the increased cost largely by revenues extracted from territories outside Ulster on which they now encroached. With the Catholic bishops, they also renewed their appeals to Spain, hoping that their victory would convince the new Spanish king, Philip III, that support for them would benefit his wider ambitions. Philip was sympathetic.<br>
<br>Even without Spanish support, the victory of Yellow Ford prompted a reorientation of English military priorities that was symbolized by the appointment in April 1599 of Elizabeth's favourite Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, as lord lieutenant, with 17,300 troops&#151;the largest army to leave England during her reign. Before assuming his post Essex won endorsement for his strategy of establishing a chain of fortified positions along the eastern and western entries to Ulster, plus a fort on Loughfoyle which could be provisioned by sea. It was intended to attack the confederates from three sides simultaneously, and to destroy the crops and to kill the civilian population that sustained the Ulster war effort. This was delayed and, on arrival in Dublin, Essex was persuaded by the Irish privy council to relieve those outposts that remained loyal in Leinster and Munster before launching an attack on Ulster. He became embroiled in Leinster and Munster while awaiting the marine support needed to execute his Ulster strategy, instead of confronting the confederates as ordered. When Essex eventually headed for Ulster, in September 1599, this support had not yet arrived and the season for fighting was already past. Thus he had no option but to temporize. This explains the famous parley between Tyrone and Essex at a river ford north of Dundalk. There the unarmed Tyrone, &#145;putting his horse up to the belly in water, with all humbleness&#146; explained to his former patron's son, &#145;standing on the other bank&#146;, that he sought peace with the queen. What Tyrone demanded, besides the usual immunity from direct government supervision, is unclear: his subsequent assertion that he gave priority to religion was categorically denied by Essex, who testified that &#145;toleration in religion&#146; was &#145;mentioned in deed, but never yielded unto by him, nor yet stood upon by the Traitor, to whom the earl had said plainly Hang thee up, thou carest for religion as much as my horse&#146;  (Moryson, pt 2, bk 2, 38).<br>
<br>Essex's enemies at court used his alleged capitulation to Tyrone to destroy him and Elizabeth resolved not to offer Tyrone pardon. Charles Blount, eighth Baron Mountjoy, was appointed lord deputy in February 1600 essentially to complete Essex's military agenda, but with the resources formerly denied to his predecessor. Tyrone was quickly hemmed in and thrown back on the limited resources available to him in Ulster. Recognizing that confrontation was now inevitable, he offered his associates unqualified support, declaring a religious war. He apparently also cultivated a closer relationship with Catholic clerics, while continuing to represent himself as an upholder of English civility. This is suggested by Sir John Harington's encounter, when visiting Tyrone in 1599. Then the earl's two sons, Hugh and Henry, were both &#145;dressed in English clothes, with velvet jerkins and gold lace &hellip; acquainted with the English tongue&#146; and able to recite from an English translation of Ariosto, but tutored by Aodh Mac Aingil, a Counter-Reformation priest and future activist for the cause at St Anthony's College, Louvain  (Meehan, 27).<h2>
<a name="CounterReformationchampion16001603"></a>Counter-Reformation champion, 1600&#150;1603</h2>One of Tyrone's hopes in declaring his religious war was to win support from those people in Ireland who had remained obedient. This prospect faded in 1600 when Sir George Carew, given charge of 3000 men in Munster, succeeded in recovering government authority outside Ulster. Thereafter it was apparent that Tyrone had no hope of fresh adherents unless he could confront and defeat Mountjoy's army, and for that military reinforcements from the continent were essential. Therefore, as prospects of substantial help from Spain increased in 1601, Tyrone avoided conflicts with the crown forces pressing in upon his home territory. The confederacy had to ward against defections, which became ever more frequent, while Tyrone had to guard against assassination attempts prompted by Mountjoy. He maintained discipline and trained his men in the pike warfare that would follow once Spanish assistance arrived. Fynes Moryson acknowledged Tyrone's efforts to meet this challenge but noted with satisfaction that the confederates were not yet ready to confront drilled opponents in the field: they were no sooner exposed to &#145;some volleys&#146; from field guns than &#145;their puppets bravery suddenly vanished, and according to their wonted manner, they hid themselves in the woods&#146;  (Moryson, pt 2, bk 2, 113). Such inadequacy gave added urgency to the confederate appeals for Spanish support, so as to secure a backbone of seasoned pikemen for the army confronting Mountjoy.<br>
<br>Strategy dictated that any sizeable Spanish force should disembark south of Ulster because of the need for provisions, and Limerick or Galway seemed best, but the force of 3000 men, under Juan del &Aacute;guila, which reached Ireland in September 1601, disappointed the insurgents, first because it was half the expected size and second because it disembarked at Kinsale, co. Cork, far distant from Ulster. There they were immediately besieged by Carew, president of Munster, while Mountjoy rushed to take command of a larger assault force, 7000 strong. The harsh winter of 1601&#151;with snow, frost, and swollen rivers&#151;both helped and hindered the extraordinary feat of leading from Ulster to Kinsale two armies, Hugh O'Donnell's passing through Connaught, Tyrone's via the pale: it enabled them to follow normally impassable routes, thus evading the English forces sent to cut them off. The two armies also merged successfully and approached the Spanish force, now but 2400 strong. Tyrone hoped to avoid battle and to deny food and fodder to the English army, which was suffering more severely from disease and exposure than the Spaniards were. This plan was rejected by the Spaniards, by the Irish clerics accompanying them, and by O'Donnell, who all wanted to join the two forces, despite confusion. As this difficult manoeuvre was proceeding, Tyrone's ill-prepared forces broke ranks when exposed to an English cavalry charge, O'Donnell's army then fled, and the Spaniards had no opportunity to engage. The battle of Kinsale (24 December 1601) shattered whatever prospect Tyrone ever had of dictating terms to the English crown. The confederates were decimated and demoralized, their weapons mostly abandoned, and the Spaniards surrendered to Mountjoy and were permitted to return home. Tyrone was isolated.<br>
<br>Even in defeat Tyrone remained determined to fight for terms from a government initially fixed on massive confiscation of property and an Ulster plantation. He held out in his Ulster fastnesses even as government troops pillaged his core territories and destroyed the crops that sustained the war effort. Officials were astonished to find that his closest followers would not desert him and speculated that only Tyrone's death, capture, or flight would end what became a war of attrition. Two factors in his favour were the mounting cost to the government and Elizabeth's failing health. Furthermore, if he managed to escape to Spain, Tyrone could complicate the peace overtures under way to end the Spanish war. He remained in arms until Mountjoy and Carew won permission to reach an accommodation. In February 1603 Mountjoy was authorized by Sir Robert Cecil, principal secretary of state, to receive Tyrone to mercy.<br>
<br>The generosity of the terms ultimately conceded to Tyrone by the so-called treaty of Mellifont (30 March) is explained both by Mountjoy's concern to settle before the earl learned of Elizabeth's death and by his determination to attend James VI and I. Tyrone's doggedness was thus rewarded: in return for abjuring the name and title of O'Neill and promising to sever all contact with Spain, he was assured of his earldom in perpetuity, with the promise of new letters patent on condition that his &#145;country&#146; pay composition rent to the crown. This agreement seemingly left Tyrone in much the same position as he had enjoyed in 1587, albeit as ruler of a lordship devastated by prolonged warfare. In addition, he was without rivals within his lordship, and further strengthened his position by persuading Mountjoy to have the entire O'Donnell lordship granted to Rury O'Donnell, who became first earl of Tyrconnell. Tyrone and O'Donnell accompanied Mountjoy to meet James in England in 1603, with the intention of having &#145;one assured in Tyrconnell and another in Tyrone&#146; each &#145;able utterly to suppress&#146; his local opponents  (N. Canny, &#145;The treaty of Mellifont, 1603&#146;, <span class="italic">Irish Sword</span>, 9, 1970, 380&#150;99).<h2>
<a name="Anearlrestored16031607"></a>An earl restored, 1603&#150;1607</h2>This outcome represented a diplomatic victory for Tyrone. Army captains, crown officials, and even the English public were dismayed, while lesser lords in Ulster who had deserted the earl during the war had most reason to feel betrayed. Consequently between 1603 and 1607 Tyrone was preoccupied on one level with consolidating his position within his devastated lordship and on another with defending himself against those who resented his success. This attack was many-faceted, involving co-operation between servitors who held positions or property in Ulster, officials in Dublin, churchmen eager to make the established church a reality in Ulster, and former subordinates of Tyrone who wanted the government to honour its promises to make them independent of a vengeful lord. Collectively these enemies set about identifying concealed land within the two lordships which might be claimed as crown property, especially fishing rights on lakes and rivers and church property. A series of legal challenges and investigations ensued, leading ultimately to the suggestion that title to the disputed properties should be established by an inquisition. This decision produced the apparently reasonable demand that the lordships of Tyrone and Tyrconnell should become shire ground, a task delegated to Sir John Davies, solicitor-general. Davies enjoyed fulsome support from Sir Arthur Chichester, lord deputy, but made little initial progress because the earl of Devonshire (Mountjoy) defended the arrangement on which he had staked his reputation. His influence, however, waned by 1605 and the subsequent struggle between Tyrone and Davies was every bit as personal as that previously fought between Tyrone and Bagenal. Davies held that the patents devised for Tyrone and Tyrconnell were unjust because the earls had been granted outright ownership of their entire lordships irrespective of the rights of the other O'Neills, the lesser lords, and the church. Davies wished to segment the Tyrone and Tyrconnell lordships to reflect the wider claims to property within them, while Tyrone held rigidly to the view that his grandfather in 1542 and he in both 1587 and 1603 had been granted outright ownership of the entire lordship of Tyrone. His position, therefore, was that the only others who had property rights within the lordship were those appointed by him after 1590 and again in 1605 as tenants-in-chief. To counter this Davies encouraged Tyrone's estranged son-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20479/', "Sir Donnell Ballagh O'Cahan")</script>, to bring an action against him before the Dublin courts contending that since, under the Gaelic dispensation, the ruling O'Cahan had been a sovereign lord, a major injustice had been perpetrated by the passing of Tyrone's patent. Davies hoped, if successful, to establish a precedent which would result in the dismemberment of the Tyrone lordship among several claimants, all of whom, including Tyrone himself, would then be ruled by a provincial president. Confronted with this challenge, Tyrone petitioned James for support. The king's agreement to resolve the dispute in person represented a major concession to Tyrone, who commented that if he were dissatisfied with the outcome he would &#145;choose&#146; to live in England rather than be &#145;governed by any other than your Majesty and your deputy general of this realm&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/218/71). In this event Tyrone probably intended to play the part of a &#145;British&#146; courtier at the Jacobean court, leaving his heir, Hugh O'Neill, fourth baron of Dungannon, to handle his Irish affairs. Dungannon would probably be better suited to a rigidly monitored life and, since his father was finalizing a marriage for him with a daughter of Archibald Campbell, seventh earl of Argyll, and his first wife, Anne&#151;thus linking &#145;Mac O'Neill with the daughter of McKallym, for so the Scottish Irish call the earl of Argyll&#146;  (Meehan, 101)&#151;would also be better placed to receive royal favour.<br>
<br>Following James's decision Tyrone and Davies each spent much of 1607 preparing for the anticipated royal hearing, which would have implications for all Ulster lordships. Yet it seemed of little consequence when Tyrconnell and Cuconnaught Maguire openly admitted their inability to manage their lordships, lamenting that economic circumstances would force them to join their fellow countrymen as soldiers in Spanish service. Nobody thought, for a moment, that Tyrone would also leave, because of his age, his dedication to countering Davies's every move, his involvement with his son's prospective marriage, and his seeming resolve to plead his case before the king. Therefore officials were astonished when they learned on 7 September that Tyrone, as well as Tyrconnell and several family members and retainers of both lords, had taken ship three days previously for an unknown destination. Once Spain emerged as their intended landfall, officials asked why Tyrone decided to participate in this dramatic exit, known in Irish historiography as the &#145;flight of the earls&#146;. Two points were put forward, and are still being debated by historians; first, whether Tyrone, like Tyrconnell, had long contemplated this move or was panicked into joining the expedition only on hearing that the ship commissioned by Maguire had landed at Lough Swilly, and, second, whether Tyrone was resigned to losing everything or had left in the hope of returning with Spanish military support.<br>
<br>On the first point, the evidence suggests that Tyrone's action was not premeditated: he was at Slane, co. Meath, in the lord deputy's company, and seemingly preparing both for his impending visit to the king and for the marriage of his son when word reached him of the ship's arrival at Lough Swilly. This news would not have surprised him and cannot alone have startled him into abandoning the country. Government officials concluded that Christopher St Lawrence, ninth Baron Howth, then put &#145;buzzes&#146; in Tyrone's ear convincing him that &#145;if he went into England he should either be perpetual prisoner in the Tower of London or else lose his head and members&#146;. Tyrone would unquestionably have been alert to this possibility, as on all previous visits to the English court, but in his own version of his meeting at Slane, the fresh information causing him disquiet was that Chichester had persuaded the king, through the procurement of Cecil, the earl of Salisbury, to overlook in favour of himself Tyrone's request to be appointed president of Ulster. This, according to Tyrone, convinced him that the king would similarly dismiss his other petitions and that life in exile would be preferable to &#145;the misery he saw sustained by others through the oppression of the like government&#146;  (Meehan, 126).<h2>
<a name="Theexile16071616"></a>The exile, 1607&#150;1616</h2>Tyrone's explanation of his departure suggests that he entertained no hopes in September 1607 of Spanish military support. He was an astute politician who accepted, unlike his lay and clerical associates, that the calamity at Kinsale had ended any realistic prospects of further substantial military support from Spain. His flight was an act of desperation, an interpretation that fits the known details of his final actions in Ireland&#151;the sad farewell to his friends, the desperate effort to gather up his three sons by his fourth wife (ultimately, he was forced to leave one behind), and his seemingly brutal effort to compel his reluctant countess to accompany him. Moreover his subsequent &#145;articles&#146; addressed to James from the continent (which probably derived from the statement of grievance originally intended for presentation to the king) suggests a belated recognition that he had acted rashly and that his best hope of receiving succour lay in London rather than Madrid. These &#145;articles&#146; gave priority to religious grievances, and, in correspondence with the Spanish court, Tyrone also emphasized his loss and sufferings for the sake of Catholicism, whose defence had always been his prime concern. This was the only argument to advance once he had placed his trust in Spain, and the only position that his clerical correspondents with the court in Madrid would countenance. Perhaps he became convinced by his own rhetoric, especially as Fearghal &Oacute;g Mac an Bhaird, in <span class="italic">M&oacute;r do mhill aoibhneas &Eacute;irinn</span> (&#145;Greatly has it destroyed the beauty of Ireland&#146;), sought further to convince him that his failure to return with an invading force meant that the trials of the Nine Years' War had been endured in vain.<br>
<br>Returning to Ireland was not an option for Tyrone, but exile became especially bitter as Philip's embarrassment with his guests became apparent. The exiles intended to disembark at Corunna and to proceed to Madrid in the hope of an audience with the king. They landed, however, in Normandy and were granted safe passage to Spanish Flanders. There they were welcomed by the Irish military and clerical community, including Tyrone's second son, Henry, a colonel in the Spanish army. Despite the honours and entertainment enumerated by Tadhg &Oacute; Cian&aacute;in, the dutiful narrator of the flight, the harsh reality was that those declared rebels by James were neither welcome in Flanders nor in Spain lest their presence compromise the peace. Instead, Tyrone and his companions were dispatched along &#145;the Spanish road&#146; towards Milan and eventually to Rome where they were assigned a residence by Pope Paul V as pensioners of Philip. The correspondence of Tyrone and his companions concerns the early deaths of some of the exiles, the survivors' supplications for continued support, and their futile pleas to the Spanish government&#151;oscillating between demands for a fresh invasion of Ireland and requests for intercession with James for restoration of their estates and of Catholicism as the religion of Ulster. Thomas Gainsford witnessed Tyrone's company making its way to Rome and noted that the earl stayed in a &#145;common inn&#146; while in Milan and became &#145;the subject of charity and had only a poor supplement from some special cardinals&#146; during his final years in Rome  (Gainsford, 1, 6, 14). Tyrone's health deteriorated and he became almost blind. He died of fever on 20 July 1616 in Rome and was buried there after a fairly elaborate funeral ceremony in the Spanish church of San Pietro Montorio. The countess of Tyrone is believed to have died on 15 March 1618 in Rome.<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>For Gainsford, Tyrone's &#145;dejection&#146; provided &#145;exemplary&#146; proof of his maxim that subjects who were &#145;seduced&#146; from their &#145;faithfulness&#146; by the promises of foreign princes would be &#145;made the tennis ball of fortune&#146; and forced &#145;to fly to foreign princes for refuge&#146;  (Gainsford, 1, 6, 14). He believed that Tyrone had been hoodwinked by survivors of the Spanish Armada into allying with Spain and that all his actions after 1588 were motivated by this fact. Ironically, the Counter-Reformation historian Philip O'Sullivan Beare took this story up but used it for a different purpose. Like Gainsford, he saw Tyrone's life largely in terms of prevarication and deception but regarded him as cleverly disguising his intentions from the government before allying with Spain to strike a blow for Catholicism. O'Sullivan saw him as an exemplar to Irish Catholics and wanted to refute the denigration of Moryson and Gainsford and the work of other Irish Catholic historians, including Lughaidh &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh, who remained in Ireland and argued that Hugh Roe O'Donnell was the heroic figure, not Tyrone. In the short term O'Sullivan's version of events proved the more appealing and when Giovanni Battista Rinuccini, archbishop of Fermo, the papal nuncio to Ireland, presented Tyrone's sword to his nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20783/', "Owen Roe O'Neill")</script>, in 1646 it was regarded as identifying the latter as the possible king of a Catholic Ireland.<br>
<br>The evidence concerning Tyrone's career hardly accords with the accounts of Gainsford and O'Sullivan, or the succession of writers following in their respective traditions. Tyrone has been employed to support different causes through selective use of the evidence. More careful attention to each phase of his career and to the explanations that he offered to justify his actions reveals a less charismatic or attractive man, who was committed to few causes other than his own survival and the preservation of his family. However, he was caught in something of a bind between the fears and expectations of the government and the hopes of his Gaelic Irish supporters. He was proud of the achievements of his sons, but displayed a utilitarian attitude towards his wives and children and could be brutal to kinsmen. He was loyal to those of his English and Irish adherents who remained loyal to him, but exacted harsh revenge on any he regarded as having betrayed him. He tried to remain loyal to the crown for as long as possible and to his political allies and was amenable to aspects of royal policy in Ulster. He only championed the cause of Spanish intervention and the Counter-Reformation when he recognized that he could not reconcile loyalty to Elizabeth with acceptance of increased circumscription of his power and of his room to manoeuvre. However, he was a pragmatist, who was conscious of his strengths and weaknesses as a military commander and of the limitations of his forces. Moryson, although biased, made what is perhaps the shrewdest observation of Tyrone, when he met him, describing him as a man:<blockquote>of mean stature, but of a strong body, able to endure labours, watching, and hard fare, being withall industrious, and active, valiant, affable, and apt to manage great affairs, and of a high, dissembling, subtle and profound wit. So as many deemed him born either for the great good or ill of his country. (Moryson, pt 2, chap. 1.7)</blockquote>
