<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Faulkner,  (Herbert Gustavus) Max</span>  (1916&#150;2005), <span class="occ">golfer</span>, was born at 36 Havelock Road, Bexhill, Sussex, on 29 July 1916, the eldest son of Gustavus Kirkham (Gus) Faulkner, a professional golfer then based at Selsey, and his wife, Eliza Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hussey. His early education was in Wales, while his father was the professional at Pennard on the Gower peninsula, then in Surrey when he moved to Bramley. Max Faulkner worked first as his father's assistant, then became the professional at Leamington Spa. As a player he first came to prominence in 1937 when he won both the Berkshire championship and the Addington foursomes. On 20 August 1938 he married Joan, the 21-year-old daughter of William Frederick Weller, farmer, of Amberley Farm, Milford, Surrey. They had three children, Guy, Hilary, and John.<br>
<br>Like so many sportsmen of his generation Faulkner was deprived of some of his best competitive years by the Second World War. During the conflict he served as a physical training instructor with the RAF, concentrating on boxing far more than on golf (he claimed later to have played only one round during the entire war). None the less after demobilization he returned to his first love, and victory in the west of England professional championship of 1947 helped secure his selection in the British Ryder cup team of that year. In all he played in five Ryder cup matches (1947, 1949, 1951, 1953, and 1957), although his personal record was disappointing and he won one solitary point from eight games played. In 1949 he won both the Penfold and Lotus tournaments, and tied for sixth place in the open championship, four strokes behind the winner, Bobby Locke. In the following year Locke won again, with Faulkner coming fifth.<br>
<br>These experiences of contending at the highest level paved the way for Faulkner's greatest triumph, and the feat for which he is best remembered, his victory in the open championship of 1951, held that year for the first (and at the time of his death only) time at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland. Three opening rounds of 71, 70, and 70 gave Faulkner a substantial lead of six strokes with eighteen holes to play, and, although the Argentinian golfer Antonio Cerd&aacute; chased him hard on the final afternoon, Faulkner held on to win by two shots with a score of 285. This proved to be the only home win in the open championship between Henry Cotton's third and final victory in 1948 and Tony Jacklin's triumph of 1969, which ushered in an altogether different era in the history of British, and indeed European, golf. In all Faulkner won sixteen European professional tournaments, including the Dunlop masters of 1951, the Spanish open championship three times (in 1952, 1953, and 1957), and the Portuguese open title of 1968. In 1953 he won the <span class="italic">News of the World</span> tournament (then effectively the Professional Golfers' Association match-play championship) at Ganton, defeating Dai Rees in the final.<br>
<br>Faulkner's style was distinctive, elegant, and powerful, with immense ball-striking ability. He regularly won long-driving competitions, and always maintained a high level of physical fitness. He was an inveterate fixer and manipulator of golf clubs, and was rumoured to possess more than 300 putters, many of his own design. That said, Faulkner never forgot that golf was a game, and that paying spectators deserved to be entertained. He was a &#145;personality&#146; before the term was invented, and something of a flamboyant dresser, in contrast to many of his fellow competitors, whose often austere demeanour reflected the prevailing drabness of the years after the war, when many golf clubs were struggling for survival. &#145;Faulkner stories&#146; abounded among golf journalists, for whom he was always good copy, and Henry Longhurst always claimed that he witnessed Faulkner signing autographs at Portrush in 1951 with the appendage &#145;open champion 1951&#146; when two rounds still remained to be played.<br>
<br>In later life Faulkner received several honours, including being appointed OBE (2001) and being made a freeman of the City of London. He played numerous exhibition matches for charitable causes, and was involved in both personal and professional ways in nurturing young golfing talent. In particular he headed the &#145;Butten boys&#146; initiative of the businessman Ernest Butten, who wanted to develop a cohort of British golfers capable of challenging the very best American and international players. Among these was Brian Barnes, who not only married Faulkner's daughter, Hilary, but later followed his father-in-law as champion of Spain and Portugal, played in the Ryder cup on several occasions, and in 1995 secured a memorable triumph in the British seniors open, watched in person by Faulkner over the same Portrush links where the latter had won the open forty-four years previously. Barnes also shared with Faulkner a love of fishing. Having lived latterly at Pulborough, Sussex, Faulkner died on 26 February 2005 at St Richard's Hospital, Chichester, of pneumonia.<br>
