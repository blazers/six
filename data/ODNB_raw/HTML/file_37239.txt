<span class="headword">Buddicom,  William Barber</span>  (1816&#150;1887), <span class="occ">mechanical and civil engineer</span>, was born in Everton on 1 July 1816, the second son of Robert Pedder Buddicom (1781&#150;1846) rector of Everton and later principal of St Bees College, and his wife, Ellin, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barber. He was educated at home and in 1831 was apprenticed to Mather, Dixon &amp; Co. of Liverpool.<br>
<br>In 1836 Buddicom was appointed resident engineer of the Liverpool&#150;Newton Bridge section of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, with responsibility for its maintenance including the winding engines for the steeply graded tunnel sections at Edge Hill, as well as for the replacement of the original rails which were far too light to carry heavy traffic. At this time he came to the attention of Joseph Locke, who was to play an important part in developing his career. In 1838 Locke invited him to become resident engineer on the Glasgow&#150;Paisley railway. In 1840, on Locke's recommendation, he became locomotive superintendent of the Grand Junction Railway where he introduced to locomotive drivers a system of premiums for economies in fuel and oil, which enabled working expenses to be reduced considerably. He was involved with Alexander Allan, the works manager at Liverpool, in rebuilding existing inside-cylinder locomotives, the crank axles of which frequently fractured, with outside-cylinder drive. This was the origin of the Crewe locomotive type, which was built on a large scale after the transfer of the Grand Junction Railway works to Crewe, in the planning of which Buddicom was deeply involved.<br>
<br>In 1841 Locke invited Buddicom to France to work on the Paris&#150;Rouen railway, which opened in 1843 and was subsequently extended to Le Havre. There he became manager with William Allcard of the Allcard Buddicom works near Rouen. These works were founded by Buddicom in association with the contractors William Mackenzie and Thomas Brassey, and capitalists involved in the line, to supply locomotives and rolling stock for the railway, and to manage its operation. In 1845 he married Marie Jeanne (<i>d</i>. 1892), daughter of Joseph Robert Howman RN, who had been involved from 1832 in the management of the Martin Cie ironworks at Sotteville. They had three daughters and at least three sons.<br>
<br>During the revolutionary period in France which followed the fall of Louis Philippe in 1848, Buddicom struggled valiantly to keep the railway in operation despite considerable financial problems and physical danger to himself and to his family. In addition to work for the Paris&#150;Rouen&#150;Le Havre lines, Buddicom supplied locomotives and equipment for the Orl&eacute;ans&#150;Tours and Amiens&#150;Boulogne railways. In 1849 a second works was built at Bordeaux-La Bastide to meet the locomotive and rolling-stock requirements of the Midi (Southern) Railway. The Buddicom company was wound up in 1861, after the works had been bought by the Chemin de Fer de l'Ouest on the expiration of existing contracts.<br>
<br>In 1854 a contractors' consortium, in which the Belgian contractors Parent and Schaecken joined Thomas Brassey and Buddicom, undertook to build the Bellegarde tunnel, 2&frac12; miles long, for the Lyon&#150;Geneva railway, and in 1860 Buddicom and Brassey undertook the conversion of the Rouen to Dieppe railway from single to double track. In 1863 Parent, Brassey, and Buddicom undertook to build part of the southern railway of Italy and Buddicom joined Brassey and Charles Jones in the construction and supply of motive power and rolling stock for the Maremma Railway in that country. With the deaths of Parent and Brassey in 1870 Buddicom wound up the partnership.<br>
<br>Buddicom purchased an estate near Mold in 1853 and became a JP and high sheriff of Flintshire (1864). In 1847 he was made a member of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur by Louis Philippe for his services to France. He was a member of the institutions of civil and mechanical engineers and of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Ing&eacute;nieurs Civils de France. Buddicom died at his home, Penbedw, Nannerch, Holywell, Flintshire, on 4 August 1887, and was buried at St Mary's, Nannerch.<br>
