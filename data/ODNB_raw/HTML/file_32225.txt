<span class="headword">Buxton, Sir  (Thomas) Fowell</span>, third baronet  (1837&#150;1915), <span class="occ">philanthropist, brewer, and colonial governor</span>, was born on 26 January 1837 at West Ham, Essex, the eldest of six sons of Sir Edward North Buxton, second baronet (1812&#150;1858), and his wife, Catherine, second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11775/', "Samuel Gurney (1786&#150;1856)")</script>, of the Quaker family of Upton, Essex. Buxton's paternal grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4247/', "Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton")</script>, the anti-slavery campaigner. Buxton entered Harrow School in 1850 and matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1855, proceeding MA in 1859. On 11 June 1858 he succeeded his father as third baronet and took over landed property and a partnership in the brewing firm Truman, Hanbury, Buxton &amp; Co. of Spitalfields, where he worked until 1889. On 12 June 1862 he married Lady Victoria Noel (1839&#150;1916) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55114/', "Buxton, Lady Victoria")</script>], youngest daughter of Charles Noel Noel, the first earl of Gainsborough. Of their thirteen children, five sons and five daughters survived infancy. His wife was left physically disabled by a spinal illness in 1869. From 1865 to 1868 he was Liberal MP for King's Lynn, but failed to be elected in 1874 (Westminster), 1876, 1879 (North Norfolk), and 1880 (West Essex). In parliament he promoted the Imperial Federation League and he represented Britain at several European conferences on slavery and central African affairs.<br>
<br>Buxton's evangelical faith and his wealth made him an influential figure in the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society (of which he was elected president in 1899), the volunteer movement, movements for the welfare of Africans and the improvement of elementary schools, the Church Missionary Society, and Missions to Seamen. He was elected fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1858. He was also a member of the Commons Preservation Society and, with his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53188/', "Edward North Buxton")</script>, was much involved in its campaign begun in 1866 to save Epping Forest. In particular he contributed to the fund to enable the woodcutter Thomas Willingale to assert his customary rights in a chancery suit.<br>
<br>In 1895 Buxton was appointed governor of South Australia. He was a choice which provoked amazement in England and irritation in South Australia, where the radical premier, Charles Cameron Kingston, made clear his displeasure by cutting the governor's salary and abolishing his expenses&#151;actions which could have only symbolic meaning for the wealthy Buxton. There were also some differences of policy between Buxton and Kingston, but Buxton's quiet good-heartedness and the pleasant manner of his wife and numerous children won over his critics, until Kingston declared &#145;Governor Buxton and his flock to be the most sociable and commonsense family who have ever inhabited the Adelaide vice-regal mansion&#146;  (Howell, 515). Buxton regularly visited prisoners, the insane, the sick, and the destitute; and his wife, also a devout Christian, actively promoted education (particularly for girls), and the welfare of mothers. They clearly enjoyed meeting colonists of all sorts, and regarded the recipients of their very extensive charity as individual people, with their own concerns and needs. Buxton was also remarkable for his interest in Aborigines; he took pains to understand their land-tenure system and to explain it to settlers, whom he exhorted to make amends for past injustices.<br>
<br>While on leave in England in 1898, the health of Buxton's wife and eldest son gave cause for concern and Buxton resigned without returning to Australia, though he continued to be interested in South Australian affairs. In 1899 he was created GCMG for his services. He died at Cromer on 28 October 1915 in a cottage, having characteristically given Colne House, the family home at Cromer, for use as a war hospital. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Thomas Fowell Victor Buxton (1865&#150;1919); his younger sons included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35247/', "Noel Edward Noel-Buxton, first Baron Noel-Buxton (1869&#150;1948)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74568/', "Charles Roden Buxton (1875&#150;1942)")</script>. His wife's memoirs show Buxton as a man of high principle, prepared to run the risk of unpopularity (as when he opposed his landlord neighbours' wish to enclose Epping Forest), and who put family concerns above office (as when he resigned his governor-generalship). His wealth (he left over &pound;420,000) gave him that freedom of action, but his modesty and generosity made him unusually widely admired and well liked.<br>
