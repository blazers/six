<span class="headword">O'Loghlen, Sir  Michael</span>, first baronet  (1789&#150;1842), <span class="occ">judge</span>, born in Port, co. Clare, in October 1789, was the third son of Colman O'Loghlen (1745&#150;1810), of Port, and his second wife, Susannah, daughter of Michael Finucane MD, of Ennis. He was educated at the Erasmus Smith School, Ennis, and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he was admitted in 1805 and graduated BA in 1809. He entered the Middle Temple, London, in the same year and was called to the Irish bar in Michaelmas term 1811, after which he joined the Munster circuit. On 3 September 1817 he married Bidelia, daughter of Daniel Kelly of Dublin.<br>
<br>O'Loghlen's first distinction as an advocate was gained in 1815, in a case involving important questions of law in which he was Daniel O'Connell's junior. The case came on for argument in the king's bench the day after the fatal duel between O'Connell and Captain J. N. D'Esterre, and O'Connell was in consequence absent. O'Loghlen asked for a postponement, but, the other side objecting, he argued the case alone, obtained judgment in his favour, and was specially complimented by the court on the ability and learning of his argument. He became a favourite with O'Connell, was constantly employed as his junior, and succeeded to a large part of his practice when O'Connell became absorbed in politics.<br>
<br>In a sketch by R. L. Sheil, written in 1828, O'Loghlen is described as an excellent lawyer, a master of the practice of the courts, in receipt of an immense income, and a great favourite with the judges because of the brevity, simplicity, and clearness with which his points were put. His custom was on receipt of a fee to take the shilling from each guinea and put it in a box for his wife, and at the end of one term Mrs O'Loghlen is said to have received 1500 shillings. On the passing of the <span class="roman">Catholic Emancipation Act</span> (April 1829), the leading Roman Catholic barristers expected to be made king's counsel. The honour was somewhat unfairly deferred until Trinity term 1830, when, at the instance of Lord Francis Leveson-Gower (Lord Egerton), then chief secretary, O'Loghlen, Sheil, and two other Catholics were called within the bar.<br>
<br>In January 1831 O'Loghlen was appointed third serjeant, and in 1832 he was elected a bencher of King's Inns. In the same year he was made second serjeant, and stood unsuccessfully as the Liberal candidate for the city of Dublin. On 21 October 1834 he was appointed solicitor-general for Ireland in Lord Melbourne's first government. At the general election in January 1835 he was returned for Dungarvan, and on April 29 of that year, on the formation of Lord Melbourne's second government, he was again appointed solicitor-general for Ireland. On 31 August 1835 he was appointed attorney-general. In November 1836 he was appointed a baron of the court of exchequer in Ireland, and in the following January he succeeded Sir William McMahon as master of the rolls. He was the first Catholic law officer and the first Catholic judge in Ireland since the reign of James II. On 16 July 1838, on the coronation of the queen, he was created a baronet. O'Loghlen died in George Street, Hanover Square, London, on 28 September 1842, and was buried at Recan, co. Clare.<br>
<br>Both at the bar and on the bench O'Loghlen enjoyed a high reputation. O'Connell, writing to Lord Duncannon in October 1834, said:<blockquote>Than O'Loghlen, a more amiable man never lived&#151;a more learned lawyer, a more sensible, discreet, and, at the same time, a more powerful advocate never belonged to the Irish bar. He never made an enemy, he never lost a friend &hellip; He possesses in an eminent degree all the best judicial qualities. (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 490)</blockquote>On the bench O'Loghlen justified O'Connell's forecast of his judicial powers. &#145;There never was a judge who gave more entire satisfaction to both the suitors and the profession; perhaps never one sitting alone and deciding so many cases of whose decisions there were fewer reversals&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Equity Reports</span>, 5.130). He was very courteous, carried patience almost to a fault, and was especially kind and considerate to young men appearing before him. Of his family of four sons and four daughters, three sons followed their father to the bar: the eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20746/', "Sir Colman Michael O'Loghlen (1819&#150;1877)")</script>, became judge-advocate-general; his third son, Sir Bryan O'Loghlen (1828&#150;1905), had a political career in Australia and was premier of Victoria (1881&#150;3).<br>
