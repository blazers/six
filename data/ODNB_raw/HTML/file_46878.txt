<span class="headword">Deutsch,  Oscar</span>  (1893&#150;1941), <span class="occ">cinema owner and film exhibitor</span>, was born on 12 August 1893 at Balsall Heath, Birmingham, the son of Leopold Deutsch (<i>d</i>. 1904), a scrap metal merchant, and his wife, Leah Cohen. His parents were both Jewish, and immigrants: his mother from Poland, and his father from Betzho, Transchener Komitat, in Hungary. Leopold Deutsch died in an accident in 1904, but the business was continued by his brother, Adolf Brenner, under the name of Deutsch and Brenner. Deutsch was educated at the King Edward VI Grammar School, Birmingham, where he developed a fascination for the cinema shared by two other pupils, Michael Balcon and Victor Saville. At the age of seventeen he joined Deutsch and Brenner, but found it dull and in 1920 he formed a local film distribution company with Balcon and Saville which acted as the midlands representative for C. M. Woolf's film company. Deutsch then provided some of the financial backing when his two friends went into film production in 1923, but stayed in Birmingham himself, continuing to work for the family firm. He now had a family of his own: in 1918 he married Lily Tanchan; they had three sons.<br>
<br>In 1925 Deutsch moved into cinema ownership. In partnership with Reginald Noakes he bought three cinemas, including the Globe and Crown in Coventry. He built and opened his first cinema, the Picture House at Brierley, Staffordshire, in association with several other businessmen. This was followed in 1930 by a cinema at Perry Barr, Birmingham, which was named Odeon and introduced the distinctive, straight-edged lettering of the name that was to become a well-known trademark. By 1931 Deutsch was chairman of the midlands branch of the Cinematograph Exhibitors' Association of Great Britain and Ireland.<br>
<br>In 1932 in partnership with W. G. Elcock and Stanley Bates Deutsch drew up plans to open a circuit of cinemas using the Odeon name. These were concentrated initially in south-east England and the London suburbs and set up as separate companies with a local partner who usually supplied the site or was the builder of the cinema. The first five Odeons opened in 1933, followed by another seventeen in 1934. By 1936 Deutsch's circuit comprised 142 cinemas and was the fourth largest in the country.<br>
<br>The Odeon South Harrow was the first of several designed for the circuit by A. P. Starkey with simple, modern fa&ccedil;ades covered in yellow faience tiles, relieved by colour bands, which made them stand out among other buildings in the high street. The Odeon Worthing was the first to have a tower feature, while the Odeon Haverstock Hill, in north London, was the first flagship cinema. The early 1930s saw widespread new cinema construction as many circuits sought to expand, but the speed at which Deutsch enlarged the Odeon chain was phenomenal: 136 new cinemas were opened before the Second World War forced the suspension of further development. By building so many new, clearly recognizable Odeons, Deutsch cleverly established a brand image.<br>
<br>Deutsch relied on the architectural practice of Harry Weedon in Birmingham and the London practices of George Coles and Andrew Mather to design most of his new Odeons, which usually followed a house style of distinctive, streamlined exteriors using yellow or cream faience tiles and slab towers, although many were schemes already in progress that could not be revised to have the same look. When work began in 1937 on the Odeon Leicester Square, a coal-black exterior was deliberately chosen to distinguish it as the new flagship cinema from the rest of the circuit.<br>
<br>Deutsch also took over many existing cinemas, renaming them Odeons. By 1939 his circuit had built or planned cinemas in virtually every large city in England and had begun operating in Scotland. When Deutsch arranged to take over the small but well-placed Paramount chain just before the Second World War, he made Odeon without doubt equal to the two longer-established national circuits, Gaumont and ABC.<br>
<br>Deutsch was most concerned that his Odeons should be eye-catching externally, especially when outlined in neon at night. Internally, the cinemas were more functional, without the design frills of many rivals. Deutsch did not believe in organs and supporting stage shows but simply in providing films in comfortable surroundings. His wife, Lily, was a consultant on the colour schemes. There were, however, many standard features inside the cinemas, including carpets, clocks, settees, and ash-stands, all with a distinctive art deco design.<br>
<br>Deutsch gave the American distributor United Artists a substantial holding in Odeon to ensure a supply of top-quality British films, especially the productions of Alexander Korda. However, he made a specific point of not involving the company in film production, where huge losses had been incurred by other groups.<br>
<br>The growth of Odeon was all the more remarkable as Deutsch had serious health problems which were, however, a well-kept secret. He had a major operation for cancer in the late 1920s and followed a strict diet. In 1935 the head office of the Odeon circuit was moved to London and Deutsch lived close by at the Dorchester Hotel. He nevertheless returned home to Birmingham on Friday afternoons to be with his family, and to attend Singer's Hill Synagogue (of which he was warden and president) on the sabbath. A strong supporter of rearmament in the late 1930s, he was able, through the help of Sir Michael Bruce, to help significant numbers of German Jews to escape the Nazi threat.<br>
<br>Deutsch incurred considerable stress in 1938 when he set about consolidating the various local Odeon companies into one: only the assistance of his accountant, John Davis, enabled proper accounts to be produced, quashing rumours that Odeon was in financial difficulty.<br>
<br>A courteous, considerate employer, a man of great charm and charisma who readily delegated authority, Deutsch was much admired by his colleagues and staff. His early death from cancer in the London Clinic on 5 December 1941 may have been precipitated by injuries after a bomb explosion hurled him out of bed. His unachieved ambitions, left to his successor as chairman of Odeon Theatres, J. Arthur Rank, had been to take over the rival Gaumont chain and to expand abroad. He was buried in Birmingham and the funeral procession detoured to pass his first Odeon at Perry Barr. Deutsch was survived by his wife.<br>
