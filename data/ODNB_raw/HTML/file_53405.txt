<span class="headword">Wheatley <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Peters]</span>,  Phillis</span>  (<em>c.</em>1753&#150;1784), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born along the banks of the Gambia River, probably of aristocratic African parentage. The slender facial features, small nose, thin lips, and narrow brow rendered in the woodcut portrait used as the frontispiece to her only printed volume most closely resemble those of Africa's Fulani who inhabited the Gambia region by the mid-eighteenth century. She was seven or eight years old (as suggested by the presence of her adult front teeth), when she was sold on the block &#145;for a trifle&#146; to John and Susanna Wheatley, who insensitively named her after the slave schooner the <i>Phillis</i>, which had brought her from Africa to Boston. At this age she had doubtless already been influenced by a syncretistic amalgam of animism, hierophantic solar worship, and Islam practised in that region of the Gambia at the time of her birth. Despite the efforts of her Christian owners to convert her, elements of these beliefs persist throughout her poetry, and solar imagery constitutes the dominant image pattern of her verse.<br>
<br>Wheatley first came to the attention of the British audience with the London publication of her much celebrated elegy on the death of George Whitefield, friend of the Methodist John Wesley and of his Anglican brother Charles, and privy chaplain to the philanthropic Selina Hastings, countess of Huntingdon. Whitefield had died on 30 September 1770 in Newburyport, Massachusetts, just a week after having preached in Boston where he had probably lodged with the Wheatleys, as Susanna was a correspondent with the countess. Almost certainly crossing the Atlantic with news of this famous evangel's passing, variant forms of this elegy were widely circulated in broadside. Briefer and more accessible to the public than Charles Wesley's 536-line elegy on his friend or Thomas Gibbons's Latin epitaph, it soon came to the admiring eyes of the countess, later to be a pivotal player in the evolution of Wheatley's career.<br>
<br>As a slave and a woman, Wheatley would have acquired only with difficulty the learning necessary to compose the sophisticated poetry of her <span class="italic">Poems on Various Subjects</span> (1773). John Wheatley, nevertheless, claimed that she could read all parts of the King James <span class="roman">Bible</span> within sixteen months of her arrival in Boston and that, since that time, she had acquired expertise in Latin. Her brilliant version of the Niobe episode from book VI of Ovid's <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span> ably attests her ability; almost doubling Ovid's Latin Wheatley renders &#145;Niobe in distress &hellip;&#146; as a 212-line epyllion or short epic. The biblical tale of David and Goliath she also transforms into an epyllion of 222 lines, and she demonstrates even more extensive knowledge of Greek and Roman classical forms in her composition of several epic hymns, most of which are, significantly, written in celebration of women.<br>
<br>Little is known about how Phillis Wheatley acquired her great learning, although it is possible that Mary Wheatley, John and Susanna's daughter, who was six years older than Phillis, taught her to read the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in English. As none of the Wheatley family appears to have known Latin, she must have gone outside the family for this education. It has been suggested, based on the evidence of pervasive verbal parallels between her verse and the poetry of Mather Byles, that he may have acted as her tutor and poetic adviser. Byles, who lived across the street from the Wheatleys and was Harvard-educated, was a once popular poet who had become the Congregational minister of Boston's Old South Church.<br>
<br>When in early 1772 Wheatley tried to assemble a volume of her poetry in Boston, she met an unreceptive audience. Learning of her difficulty, the countess encouraged her to seek a London publisher. Hence began the series of events which brought her in the summer of 1773 to London where she prepared her book for publication by the London printer and acquaintance of the countess, Archibald Bell. This volume, probably subsidized by the countess, was quite different from that she had proposed to the Boston audience. The earlier volume (which never appeared) was to have contained enough poems favourable to the fomenting colonial rebellion that it could have been called a clarion for the revolution. By contrast, the 1773 volume was more muted, including pieces on such aesthetic topics of the time as memory, imagination, and the religious sublime.<br>
<br>While Wheatley herself claimed that her London trip was undertaken on medical advice, her activities there were hardly those of one affected by ill health. In London for only six weeks from 17 June to 26 July, she used this time most efficiently, almost certainly writing &#145;To Maecenas&#146;, one of her most difficult pieces, as an introduction to the volume, preparing the revised edition of <span class="italic">Poems</span> for a British audience, and touring Westminster Abbey, the British Museum, and the Royal Observatory, among other sights. Although she was not able to meet the countess, who appears to have been ill at the time, she did meet many notable people, such as the earl of Dartmouth, Thomas Gibbons, and Granville Sharp. By Wheatley's own testimony Sharp befriended her, escorting her on tours of London, and there can be no doubt that he informed her that, although still a slave in Boston, she was technically free because of the famous Somerset decision of 1772 which held that &#145;as soon as any slave sets foot upon the soil of England he becomes free&#146;. Having returned to the colonies in August, Wheatley announced in a letter of 18 October 1773 her Boston manumission; her legal freedom in Boston was, however, not won generously but only &#145;at the desire of my friends in England&#146;.<br>
<br>As it was Wheatley's success as a writer which brought her to the notice of her British friends, her pen literally freed her. Following the death of Susanna on 3 March 1774, Phillis Wheatley continued to live in the Wheatley mansion until her marriage on 1 April 1778 to John Peters, a free African American who was a grocer and advocate for black rights before the Massachusetts courts. The years after her own manumission find her struggle for freedom now embracing her black brothers and sisters. For example, in a letter dated 11 February 1774, Wheatley eloquently defines liberty for all human beings: &#145;&hellip; in every human Breast, God has implanted a Principle, which we call Love of Freedom; it is impatient of Oppression, and pants for Deliverance.&#146; During the American War of Independence, in a poem calling for an American victory, she also dares to demand that freedom from the British crown will also result in freedom for &#145;Afric's blameless race&#146;. Phillis Wheatley died in poverty on 5 December 1784 in Boston from complications of childbirth; all three of her children had died in infancy.<br>
<br>In her own time, Wheatley received many accolades. Her <span class="italic">Poems</span> was reviewed favourably in London at least nine times before the end of 1773. Voltaire read her work while he was in residence in England, and commented in a 1774 letter that she was the author of &#145;tr&egrave;s-bon vers anglais&#146;. Such renowned personages as Johann F. Blumenbach, John Stedman, Gilbert Imlay, and Thomas Clarkson, praised and quoted her. During the nineteenth century, Wheatley was celebrated by such abolitionists as Henri Gr&eacute;goire and Frederick Douglass, the latter of whom twice printed the entirety of the <span class="italic">Poems</span> in his <span class="italic">North Star</span>. The 1773 volume of <span class="italic">Poems</span> was reprinted many times in England and America during the later eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, although it appeared less frequently in America in the years following the civil war.<br>
<br>In the past, when considered at all, Wheatley's work was almost universally applied to some sort of socio-anthropological argument against slavery and/or racism. In the last quarter of the twentieth century, however, a revival of interest in her poetry has resulted in more serious critical comment than in all of the two hundred years since her death. Her poetry has been anthologized in surveys of American and world literature, such as the fourth edition of the <span class="italic">Norton Anthology of Poetry</span>. Once marginalized as a woman and as a black person, Wheatley now occupies a secure place as one of early America's best poets.<br>
