<span class="headword">Salmon,  Joseph</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1647&#150;1656), <span class="occ">Ranter</span>, was briefly prominent as a Ranter between March 1650 and 1651 although his earliest work, <span class="italic">Antichrist in Man</span> (1647), indicates that he was first a Seeker in religion. His origins remain obscure: he was known in Coventry and Wiltshire, and later in Kent. He may have come from Essex, as a Joseph Salmon led a riot in Great Burstead (Billericay) in the mid-1640s. Salmon served in the New Model Army, probably between 1647 and 1649, as a soldier and chaplain in the regiment of Commissary-General Henry Ireton. <span class="italic">A Rout, a Rout</span>, published in 1649, carries two dedications, one to the commanders and one to the soldiers&#151;or &#145;the fellowship (of <span class="smallcap">SAINTS</span> scattered) in the <span class="smallcap">ARMY</span>&#146;  (Smith, <span class="italic">Collection</span>, 191). In it he expressed a belief shared by many others that the New Model was an instrument of God that would execute the &#145;beast&#146; of monarchy and so herald the imminent second coming of Christ  (Smith, <span class="italic">Collection</span>, 193).<br>
<br>Salmon preached in Coventry on 10 March 1650, where the Ranter Abiezer Coppe had been imprisoned since January. Salmon was imprisoned too, along with Andrew Wyke, and was released on condition that he publish a recantation, which appeared in August 1651 under the title <span class="italic">Heights in Depths</span>. During his imprisonment Salmon is purported to have preached through the gratings of the prison and to have composed his most Ranterish tract, <span class="italic">Divinity Anatomized</span>. The leading Quaker George Fox visited him and disputed with him. After his release Salmon lived in Kent, preaching regularly in Rochester Cathedral and laying the foundations for what became the Quaker community there. The parish registers of St Nicholas, Rochester, record the birth of his daughter, Hephzibah, on 10 September 1652. Salmon recommended Richard Coppin as his successor and emigrated to Barbados about 1655, where he may later have been investigated for organizing conventicles. He was listed for the receipt of tenement rates in the parish of Mary Magdalene, Old Fish Street, London, in February 1655.<br>
<br>Doubts have been raised concerning the precise nature of Salmon's religious identity and experiences, but the salient details are unproblematic. Like many radical religious figures in this period, Salmon &#145;crept out of the shell of Episcopacy&#146; and, during the early and mid-1640s, passed through presbyterian, Independent, and Baptist forms of worship  (Smith, <span class="italic">Collection</span>, 210). Eventually he found all forms of religion involving &#145;externals&#146; and ordinances unsatisfying, and he describes how he became aware of the sufficiency of a personal and inward inspiration &#145;(as one inspired with a supernatural life) sprang up farr above my earthly center, into a most heavenly and divine enjoyment&#146;  (ibid., 211). This sense of transcendence from earthliness coincided with his appreciation of the power of God, which had moved successively through monarchy, parliament, and New Model Army, each time effecting a further spiritual refinement of terrestrial life.<br>
<br>From these perceptions developed the inversions of accepted moral behaviour in the name of spiritual liberty which were labelled &#145;Ranter&#146; by contemporaries. In Coventry Salmon is reported to have committed &#145;wicked Swearing, and uncleaness, which he justified and others of his way, <i>That it was God which did swear in them, and that it was their liberty to keep company with Women, for their Lust</i>&#146;  (Smith, <span class="italic">Collection</span>, 13). The reliability of this report has been questioned, and the situation has not been aided by the fact that Salmon's one definitely Ranter publication does not survive. Nevertheless Salmon did know and correspond with other Ranters and sectarians associated with them, and he was imprisoned with Coppe and Wyke. Also, his writings dating from the Coventry period that do survive show the figural playfulness characteristic of Ranter discourse. Even if he was less transgressive than the more notorious Ranters Coppe and Laurence Clarkson, he was associated with them and expressed a form of their antinomianism at the height of Ranter activity. His later position was less socially provocative but no less mystical. It is not difficult to see from Salmon's publications why more orthodox contemporaries saw atheistical or extreme heretical ideas in them, although his four pamphlets, which were read widely in radical religious circles (<span class="italic">Antichrist in Man</span> went through four editions while <span class="italic">A Rout, a Rout</span> went through two), were really a highly personal attempt to articulate a nearly inexpressible sense of union with the divine.<br>
