<span class="headword">Strachan,  John</span>  (1778&#150;1867), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and bishop of Toronto</span>, was born on 12 April 1778 in Aberdeen, one of the six children of John Strachan, overseer at a granite quarry, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Findlayson. His mother, ambitious that one of her sons should become a minister, decided that John, her favourite, must be made &#145;a gentleman&#146;. He was accordingly placed at Aberdeen grammar school and obtained a bursary to enter King's College, Aberdeen, in 1793. Unfortunately, the sudden death of his father left the young student penniless, and he was forced to teach to support his university studies; having returned to Aberdeen in autumn 1796 he graduated AM in 1797.<br>
<br>Between 1797 and 1799 Strachan was a parish schoolmaster at Dunino and Kettle, Fife, while pursuing divinity studies at St Andrews University, where he befriended Thomas Chalmers and Dr James Brown. Despairing of rising above the station of schoolmaster, in 1799 he accepted an offer from Brown to emigrate to Kingston, Upper Canada, initially as the tutor to the family of Richard Cartwright, a prominent merchant and member of the legislative council, with the promise of a professorship of mathematics at a proposed academy.<br>
<br>Upon arrival at Kingston, Strachan found that there was little prospect of establishing the academy, and he sought the post of minister at St Gabriel's Street Presbyterian Church, Montreal. Disappointed in these efforts he then sought a situation in the Church of England, and he was ordained priest in June 1804. Although later derided as &#145;the Aberdonian adventurer&#146;  (Archives of Ontario, William Proudfoot MSS, MS 54, reel 1, &#145;Extract of letter from the Rev. Wm. Barrie&#146;, 29 April 1844, <span class="italic">The Secession Missionary Record</span>, July 1844) for choosing personal preferment over the Church of Scotland, there were ample reasons for this decision. Strachan's father was a nonjuror who frequented the Episcopal church in Aberdeen, but more influential was his close friendship with the Revd John Stuart, the rector of Kingston and a former Presbyterian. From 1804 to 1811 Strachan served as rector of Cornwall, in Upper Canada, where he also opened a successful academy which catered to the sons of leading figures in government, business, and the professions. In 1807 Strachan married Ann Wood McGill, a wealthy widow; they had six children.<br>
<br>Although Strachan hoped to secure the rectorship of Kingston on the death of the Revd John Stuart in 1811, he was appointed rector of York, capital of Upper Canada, which the additional offer of the two chaplaincies of the garrison and of the legislative council persuaded him to accept. It was during these early years at York that he launched the <span class="italic">Christian Recorder</span>, the first religious periodical in Upper Canada, and continued his educational endeavours by serving as principal of the Home District grammar school. As a reward for his service in ministering to the sick, wounded, and homeless during the Anglo-American War of 1812&#150;14, and for his presidency of the Loyal and Patriotic Society of Upper Canada, Strachan was appointed to the executive council of Upper Canada (honorary member, 1815&#150;17; regular member, 1817&#150;36) and to the legislative council of Upper Canada (1820&#150;41); he became archdeacon of York in 1827.<br>
<br>It was during the 1820s, however, that Strachan emerged as the most eloquent and powerful Upper Canadian exponent of an anti-republican social order based upon the tory principles of hierarchy and subordination in both church and state. Conceiving of the church as an instrument of allegiance, and as the principal institution ensuring public order, Strachan feared the rapid spread of religious dissent among the majority of the colonial population. His sermons during this period frequently lambasted Methodism as the enemy of orderly religion and the British connection, and they articulated cardinal high-church tenets and assigned a messianic role to the Church of England as preserving the tie between the colony and the mother country. It was upon these doctrines that Strachan based his uncompromising claim to exclusive Anglican control of the clergy reserves and of the provincial university of King's College, issues which stood at the centre of his celebrated 1827 pamphlet controversy with the Methodist leader Egerton Ryerson.<br>
<br>Despite his social and political conservatism, however, Strachan was an active promoter of popular education and was an important voice in designing both the <span class="roman">Common School Act</span> of 1816 and the <span class="roman">Grammar School Act</span> of 1819. He was equally aware that the Church of England would have to modernize its institutions to compete for popular support. To this end, throughout the 1830s he urged the division of the diocese of Quebec and the careful training and selection of clergy willing to be missionaries in remote parishes. Although he was removed from the executive council in 1836 in an attempt by the British government to conciliate political reformers, Strachan's efforts finally won recognition with his appointment as bishop of Toronto in 1839.<br>
<br>The next two decades marked the defeat of Strachan's tory design in Upper Canada. Although he was successful in 1842 in founding the Diocesan Theological Institution at Cobourg, and in the same year established the Church Society to co-ordinate the efforts of clergy and laity (efforts which culminated in the establishment of an independent Canadian synod in 1857), Strachan found himself between 1849 and 1854 increasingly mounting a rearguard defence of Church of England claims to the clergy reserves and to King's College against a rising tide of Canadian opinion which sought to sever all connection between church and state. Strachan was no more successful in maintaining the internal harmony of the Church of England. In 1846 he wrote to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts that &#145;there is not to my knowledge a Clergyman in this Diocese, who deserves the imputation of being a Tractarian&#146;  (National Archives of Canada, SPG, &#145;C&#146; MSS, Canada, Dio.Toronto, Box v/44, Strachan to Sec. SPG, 19 Jan 1846). Nevertheless, his own high-church sympathies increasingly alienated clergy and laity drawn from the ranks of Irish immigrants of more low-church persuasion. These tensions, as well as Toronto's geographical size and increasing population, forced the division of Strachan's diocese in 1857 and again in 1861.<br>
<br>Strachan, who had lost his wife in 1865, died in Toronto on 1 November 1867. He was a formidable champion of a high-church tory social vision based upon monarchy and the established church anchoring an enduring relationship between the Canadian colonies and Britain.<br>
