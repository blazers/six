<span class="headword">Cropper <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Trueman]</span>, Dame  Hilary Mary</span>  (1941&#150;2004), <span class="occ">businesswoman</span>, was born on 9 January 1941 at 6 Oldham Street, Bollington, near Macclesfield, Cheshire, the daughter of Arnold Trueman, a commercial clerk then serving as an aircraftsman second class in the RAF, and his wife, Madeline Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sutton. She was educated at a convent school in Stockport, then took a sandwich course at the University of Salford, combining a mathematics degree with an apprenticeship in computer programming at an electrical engineering company in Trafford Park that produced gas turbines and industrial engines. There she was one of only three women among hundreds of men. On 16 September 1963 she married Peter John Cropper, a 23-year-old fellow computer programmer, and son of Samuel Duncan Cropper; they had two daughters and one son. In 1970 she moved to ICL, the computer manufacturer, initially working part-time while her children were small. She rose to become head of a division supplying software to customers, and ICL's most senior female employee.<br>
<br>In 1985 Cropper was headhunted by Stephanie (Steve) Shirley to become chief executive of F International (FI). Shirley had founded the company (as Freelance Programmers) in 1962 as a collective to offer home-based, part-time work to women computer programmers. The principal activity of the firm was developing software for client firms. Freelance Programmers was renamed F International in 1971, with the aim of establishing overseas subsidiaries. Cropper was not an entrepreneur in the mould of Shirley, but rather she had a gift for building up an expanding organization. Over a period of nearly twenty years she transformed FI from a modest enterprise, with a largely female workforce and a turnover of &pound;7 million, to one of Europe's most successful computer services firms with sales of &pound;450 million in 2003. Cropper was not a doctrinaire feminist, preferring to see an equal gender balance. As FI grew, both women and men took senior positions, though the company was always unique in the high proportion of women in top positions. In 1988 FI was renamed the FI Group and relocated to new headquarters in Hemel Hempstead. By means of two acquisitions the company's operations were extended to include personnel recruitment and training for information technology (IT). In addition the firm moved into &#145;outsourcing&#146;, whereby it took over the entire IT operations of major firms.<br>
<br>In 1991 Cropper led an employee buyout of the FI Group. She was particularly proud that when the company was floated on the stock market five years later, valued at &pound;70 million, more than a third of the shares were retained by staff. With the boom in value of computer-related companies in the late 1990s, more than 50 of her staff became millionaires, and a further 1000 saw their personal fortunes exceed &pound;100,000. At the same time, with a salary, shares, and benefits package worth &pound;17.4 million in 1999, Cropper was twice named Britain's highest-paid businesswoman.<br>
<br>Towards the end of the 1990s, serving variously as chief executive, deputy chairman, and executive chairman, Cropper delegated operational matters in order to play an increasingly strategic role. The FI Group expanded rapidly, making four major acquisitions to fill out the firm's portfolio of computer services. In 1998 it acquired the Indian software company IIS Infotech, which enabled FI to maintain its competitiveness by using offshore development personnel. In 1999 its consulting operations were boosted by the acquisition of the OSI Group, a UK business consultancy. In 2000 FI merged with Druid, a leading UK specialist in business software. The following year FI acquired Synergy International Consulting, based in Reno, Nevada. In 2001 FI was rebranded as Xansa. From this point the company was able to compete in global markets in a full range of computer services that included outsourcing, software development, consultancy, recruitment, and training, and it was able to survive the &#145;dot-com&#146; crash of 2000&#150;02 relatively unscathed.<br>
<br>Cropper was an advocate of strong non-executive directors, within Xansa and without. She was herself an external director of TSB, the Post Office, and Barclays Bank, and a director of the development agency London First (1996&#150;9). She was a founder of the Worshipful Company of Information Technologists in 1992 (a livery company of the City of London), a governor of the University of Hertfordshire (1995&#150;2000), a member of the government's New Deal Taskforce (2000&#150;01), and an external adviser on civil service senior appointments (2000&#150;03). She was given the freedom of the City of London in 1987 and appointed CBE in 1999. She became executive chairman of the FI Group in 2000 (and of its successor Xansa the following year), but was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2001. At first she concealed her illness from her colleagues, but her worsening condition forced her to step down as executive chairman of Xansa in 2002, becoming non-executive chairman. In her final years she became an active fund-raiser for the charity Cancer BACUP (a telephone- and internet-based advice service for cancer sufferers and their carers). She was appointed DBE in 2003. She died at her home in Somerton Randle, Somerton, Somerset, on Boxing day 2004, and was survived by her husband and three children. Her estate was valued for probate purposes at just over &pound;9 million.<br>
