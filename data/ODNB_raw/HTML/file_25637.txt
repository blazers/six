<span class="headword">Sindercombe,  Miles</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1657), <span class="occ">parliamentarian soldier and conspirator</span>, was originally from Kent. He was later reported to have been apprenticed to a surgeon near St Catherine's in the Tower, London, before the civil war, but much of his early life is very obscure. At the time of his death his widowed mother, Elizabeth, and his sister Elizabeth Herring were living in London and had visited him in the Tower. Nothing is known of a wife, although an unnamed &#145;sweetheart&#146; also visited him in the Tower.<br>
<br>Sindercombe first comes to notice in 1649, when quartermaster in the New Model Army regiment of John Reynolds the agitator. In May he was involved when the regiment mutinied, and he may have been a ringleader for he had already apparently developed pronounced Leveller convictions. When the mutiny was suppressed Sindercombe escaped, perhaps around this time (or later) lodging with a hat seller on London Bridge. He re-emerged as an enlisted soldier in Colonel Matthew Tomlinson's regiment of horse in Scotland. Here he continued his scheming, and took part in the so-called Overton plot in late 1654 to seize control of the army in Scotland from General George Monck. The intrigue fell through, and Monck dismissed Sindercombe in January 1655 as &#145;a busy and suspicious person, and one who was forward to promote such ill designs&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). By the time Monck discovered that Sindercombe had actually been one of the chief organizers of the plot, he had fled to Flanders.<br>
<br>In exile Sindercombe fell in with his fellow Leveller Edward Sexby, who encouraged his hostility to the protectorate and eventually engaged him to engineer Cromwell's assassination. Using his Spanish and royalist connections, Sexby was able to provide Sindercombe with &pound;500, weapons, and ammunition. Sindercombe's hope was that with Cromwell's removal the nation could return to the pre-1653 government of the Rump Parliament. However, should the assassination lead to the restoration of the monarchy, he hoped that so much disorder would follow that the people, in whom he placed a great deal of faith, would return Charles II once more into exile or deliver him to a well-deserved death on the scaffold.<br>
<br>On his secret return to England in 1656 Sindercombe first rented a shop in King Street, Westminster, later abandoned as impractical for an assassination attempt. He recruited others into the plot, notably John Cecil, a former trooper, and William Boyes, about whom the plotters knew very little. It was Boyes who assured his companions of royal assistance if and when Cromwell was assassinated, and he may well have been an <i>agent provocateur</i>. The group also managed to recruit one of Cromwell's life guards, John Toope, to provide information on the lord protector's movements, for by this stage Cromwell, as befitted his dignity, rarely went anywhere in public without a guard. Toope was to prove the weak link in the conspiracy; although lavished with money and tales of the honours and wealth he would obtain under the new regime after the murder, he soon had misgivings and went on to betray the plotters. Numerous warnings also came to the government through the intelligence agents of John Thurloe, the secretary of state, but this did not hamper the group's schemes to assassinate Cromwell. That they did not succeed was not out of any lack of enterprise, but rather because of a failure of nerve at the final hurdle.<br>
<br>After various attempts to catch the lord protector as he rode in his coach to Hampton Court Palace, the assassins finally thought to kill him as he was taking the air in Hyde Park. They had broken the hinges on the gates of the park in order to make a quick escape after the murder, and while Cecil lurked on the fringes of the protector's retinue, Sindercombe waited for the call outside the gates. Unfortunately for them Oliver, with his eye for good horseflesh, noticed Cecil's horse and called him over to enquire about the animal. Faced with the great man himself Cecil lost his nerve and later claimed that he would have shot Cromwell there and then, but that the horse Oliver was admiring so much was in fact ill with a cold.<br>
<br>The next scheme involved Sindercombe, under the alias John Fish, hiring a house next to Westminster Abbey. From its backyard, the assassins could shoot Cromwell as he proceeded from the abbey to parliament. They began to erect scaffolding under the pretence of building work to cover their real business. On the day parliament was due to meet, Cecil, Sindercombe, and Boyes armed themselves with pistols and waited in the yard. Unfortunately for the murderers some people came into the yard at this point. Boyes immediately decamped into the crowded street and the scheme was abandoned. In order to prove to Sexby that they were not wasting his time, the next scheme followed quickly. This was a design to fire Whitehall Palace by using a special incendiary device planted in the chapel. The plotters managed to break into the chapel and lay the device, but Toope's nerve finally broke and he betrayed the scheme to the regime, subsequently becoming an agent of Thurloe. Cecil and Sindercombe were captured and Boyes escaped. Sindercombe initially fought off the guard sent to seize him, submitting only when one of the guards cut off part of his nose in the struggle. Both he and Cecil were imprisoned in the Tower of London, where Cecil immediately confessed all he knew to Thurloe. As he had with Toope, Thurloe decided to use him as a double agent. The confessions of Cecil and Toope allowed Thurloe to reveal to parliament and the nation Edward Sexby's part in the plot. Sindercombe, however, refused to confess anything and, when tried for treason on 9 February 1657, was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. Rather than submit to the indignity of the punishment from a state he hated, Sindercombe decided, according to Sexby, to take the Roman way out. Despite being heavily guarded Sindercombe was able to procure some form of poison after a series of visits to his cell by members of his family, and the night before his execution, 13 February 1657, he used it to commit suicide. He died, having first lapsed into a coma some two hours after he had apparently taken the poison. The subsequent inquest could find little evidence of the type of toxin he had actually used, or his means of procuring it. However, Sindercombe had left a suicide note, in which he claimed that &#145;I do take this course, because I would not have all the open shame of the world executed upon my Body&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Politicus</span>, 349, 12&#150;19 Feb 1657, 7606). As a consequence the body was drawn to Tower Hill on a hurdle four days later and buried in the manner of a suicide: without ceremony, naked, and with an iron stake through its heart.<br>
<br>Sindercombe's fate made him a martyr to the Good Old Cause, an idea still followed by many in the army and men such as Edward Sexby. Consequently he was given a prominent part in Sexby's pamphlet <span class="italic">Killing Noe Murder, Briefly Discourst in Three Quaestions</span> (1657). This justified the slaying of Cromwell on the grounds of the lord protector's tyranny. Sindercombe himself seems to have been motivated less by a clearly expressed ideology than by personal bitterness over the way in which the English republic had been distorted by Cromwell's actions in April 1653 when he expelled the Rump Parliament. Nor as a seasoned mutineer, Leveller, and plotter was Sindercombe reluctant to use violent action to remedy the situation. As it was the Sindercombe plot had one significant outcome: it revived discussions as to whether the lord protector should become king, to protect both himself and the nation from any other attempts on his life.<br>
