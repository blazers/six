<span class="headword">Oking,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1559), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, is first recorded in 1521 as vicar of Hardwick, Cambridgeshire. He studied at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he proceeded BCL in 1524&#150;5. He seems to have transferred to Trinity Hall, since a letter of 1538 refers to him as of the &#145;bringing up&#146; of Stephen Gardiner, who became master there in 1525. In the latter year he became rector of St Nicholas, Feltwell, Norfolk. Commissary of the university in 1529, he became DCL in 1534. In the latter year he was appointed commissary to John Capon (or Salcot), bishop of Bangor. Almost at once he was caught up in a power struggle between William Glyn of Glynllifon and Sir Richard Bulkeley, which in 1535 resulted in his being accused by the diocesan registrar of authorizing the sale of indulgences. Bulkeley wrote to Thomas Cromwell on Oking's behalf, saying that he had heard nothing but good of him, and that he &#145;spoke as much at all times in the annulling of the bishop of Rome's authority as any man I know in these parts&#146;  (Williams, 66). This testimony notwithstanding, Oking remained a marked man, and at Christmas 1536, according to Bulkeley, he was in danger of being murdered in Bangor Cathedral as he held his consistory there.<br>
<br>In May and June 1539 Oking attended Cromwell's vicegerential synod which debated what would become the <span class="roman">Act of Six Articles</span>. He himself at first supported the evangelical opposition, but eventually voted with the conservative majority. Shortly afterwards Bishop Salcot, who had tried unavailingly to obtain preferment for Oking in 1538, took his commissary with him when he was translated to Salisbury in July. In July 1543 he took part in the trial at Windsor of the composer John Marbeck and other suspected heretics. By 16 January 1544 he had been presented to the prebend of Ratfyn, on 20 July 1546 he was installed as archdeacon of Salisbury, and on 23 August 1547 he was admitted a canon residentiary. In the latter year's convocation Oking was among those appointed to draw up a statute regulating the payment of tithes in cities and towns; he was also in the minority that opposed the legalization of clerical marriage. When Thomas Hancock preached against superstition in St Thomas's, Salisbury, Oking and Edmund Steward, chancellor of Winchester, walked out of the church and were reproved by the preacher.<br>
<br>In spite of his conservatism on marriage and other issues, Oking himself married when it became lawful for him to do so. Consequently he was deprived of his Salisbury benefices in 1554, resigning his house in the cathedral close on 26 May. But his wife may have died, or he may have separated from her, for on 11 October 1556 Oking was presented to the prebend of Highleigh in Chichester Cathedral, a living that carried with it the mastership of the grammar school. He also became rector of Fishbourne. He had probably died by 5 May 1559, when a new rector was presented, and certainly by 23 December.<br>
