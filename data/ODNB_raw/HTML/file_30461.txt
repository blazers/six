<span class="headword">Arthur, Prince</span> <span class="st"> [Prince Arthur of Connaught]</span>  (1883&#150;1938), <span class="occ">governor-general of South Africa and grandson of Queen Victoria</span>, was born Arthur Frederick Patrick Albert at Windsor Castle on 13 January 1883. He was the only son and second child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30462/', "Prince Arthur William Patrick Albert, first duke of Connaught (1850&#150;1942)")</script>, third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36652/', "Queen Victoria")</script>, and his wife, Princess Louise Margaret Alexandra Victoria Agnes (1860&#150;1917), daughter of Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia. He and his sisters, Margaret (later crown princess of Sweden) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31581/', "Patricia (later Lady Patricia Ramsay)")</script>, were largely raised at Queen Victoria's court, though in 1887 they joined their parents in India.<br>
<br>As a small boy, his father found Arthur &#145;very intelligent and even thoughtful&#146;  (Longford, 234), while his aunt, Princess Beatrice, dismissed him as &#145;slow and wanting&#146;  (ibid.). He was educated at Farnborough School, Hampshire, and Eton College before attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. In 1899 the death of his cousin Prince Alfred of Coburg raised the question of the succession to the dukedom of Coburg. The duke of Connaught was now heir apparent to this title, with Prince Arthur next in line. Connaught saw some merit in his son taking on the German title since as a prince of the United Kingdom he would receive no civil list income and yet be debarred from earning a living. Queen Victoria did not want him to leave his family, while the Kaiser objected to Connaught, his uncle. Young Prince Arthur refused to leave Eton. He threatened his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41068/', "Charles Edward, duke of Albany")</script>, with a thrashing if he did not offer himself as a candidate. Under pressure, Albany surrendered his English nationality and duly succeeded as duke of Coburg, with lamentable consequences for himself when war broke out between England and Germany.<br>
<br>Prince Arthur was commissioned into the 7th hussars in 1901 and served in South Africa on an exposed plain outside Krugersdorp. He later became captain in the Royal Scots Greys in 1907, rising to brevet lieutenant-colonel in 1919, honorary major-general in 1920, and colonel-in-chief of the regiment in 1921.<br>
<br>As one of only two grandsons of Queen Victoria available for royal duties (the other being the prince of Wales, later King George V), Prince Arthur was deployed by King Edward VII for those he found irksome, an early example being the entertainment of the shah of Persia (with whom conversation was impossible) during his state visit in August 1902. He was sent to Japan to invest Emperor Mutsuhito with the Order of the Garter in 1906, returning via Canada. In 1912 he represented George V at the same emperor's funeral and invested Emperor Yoshihito with the Garter. In 1918 he was again sent to Japan to hand the emperor a field marshal's baton. There were missions to Portugal (1908) and to Russia, Bavaria, and Italy (1911). Prince Arthur was a councillor of state during George V's visit to India for the Delhi durbar from 1911 to 1912.<br>
<br>During the First World War Prince Arthur went out with the Old Contemptibles, serving as aide-de-camp to Sir John French, commander-in-chief of the British empire forces, from 1914 and in similar appointments under General Haig and Sir Charles Carmichael Monro until September 1916, when he was transferred to his regiment until March 1917. He then served on the general staff on the western front until 1919, being twice mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>Having earlier wished to marry one of the daughters of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, Prince Arthur was married on 15 October 1913 to his first cousin once removed, Alexandra, duchess of Fife (1891&#150;1959) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30376/', "Alexandra, Princess")</script>], daughter of the princess royal and a granddaughter of Edward VII. His bride gave her husband a cigarette case inscribed &#145;From Fife to Drum&#146;. They had one son, Alastair, who eventually succeeded his grandfather as second duke of Connaught and died in Canada on 26 April 1943, making the dukedom of Connaught extinct.<br>
<br>In 1920 there were rumours that Prince Arthur might become king of Greece, which were denied by the Foreign Office. Instead he served as governor-general of South Africa from 1920 to 1923. Being a member of the British royal family, and thus above political suspicion, he received a warm welcome from the South Africans, and made a point of undertaking special duties for the indigenous peoples. General Smuts, the prime minister, was pleased with the reception of his royal governor-general, and on his departure praised him for having done everything possible to &#145;advance the interests of South Africa&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, December 1923).<br>
<br>During Prince Arthur's South African years, depression in trade and industry led to unemployment, economies in public and railway services, and the Rand strike of 1922, which was suppressed by martial law; he had handed over South African military command to the union authorities in the previous year. In 1922 he inaugurated the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, becoming its first chancellor. He opened Cape Technical College in 1923, and the barrage on Vaal River at Vereeniging in the same year. He travelled widely, sometimes to remote areas by car and by horseback, and was generally successful in prompting feelings of good-neighbourliness in many communities. Yet his official secretary, Bede Clifford, found him peevish, rebuking officials for minor infringements of etiquette. Once, in the Eastern Province, Prince Arthur doggedly proceeded with a speech to adults which had been written for schoolchildren, and a talk in Portuguese west Africa, in which he touched on the well-meaningness of government stock inspectors, was received with groans.<br>
<br>At his own request Prince Arthur resigned as governor-general in 1923 and returned to England. Thereafter he was based in London, where he led a more leisurely life. His principal occupation was as chairman of Middlesex Hospital from March 1924. &pound;2 million were raised, much of the total being due to his efforts on the special appeal committee, and the Middlesex became one of the greatest teaching hospitals with first-rate laboratories, a new outpatients' building, and a new nurses' home. He was also closely involved with the work of University College and Moorfields hospitals.<br>
<br>Prince Arthur was a tall, stooping figure, known for his shyness and reticence. He once arrived to open a church f&ecirc;te in Buckinghamshire via a side route. But when he took an interest in the lack of playing fields for poor boys, he played skittles happily in an East End mission hall. He was appointed KG (1902), KT (1913), privy councillor (1910), GCMG (1918), GCVO (1899), and CB (1915), and held the Royal Victorian Chain (1906). His father being actively involved in freemasonry, Prince Arthur was initiated in the Royal Alpha Lodge, no. 16, London, in 1911.<br>
<br>In May 1937 Prince Arthur took his place with the royal dukes in Westminster Abbey at the coronation of King George VI, representing his aged father at the ceremony. Within the year, he developed cancer of the throat. He travelled to Switzerland for treatment, returning in March 1938 looking painfully thin. He died at his home, 41 Belgrave Square, London, on 12 September 1938 and was buried on 22 September in the burial-ground at Frogmore. The king attended the funeral, and the archbishop of Canterbury paid tribute at the memorial service to &#145;the quiet courage and patience with which he met the duties and some of the disappointments of his life&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 Sept 1938).<br>
