</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Combe <span class="st"> [Comb]</span>,  George</span>  (1788&#150;1858), <span class="occ">phrenologist</span>, was born in Livingstone Yards, Edinburgh, on 21 October 1788, one of the seventeen children of George Comb (<i>d</i>. 1815), a brewer, and Marion Newton (<i>d</i>. 1819), who came from a family of tenant farmers. Combe recalled in his autobiography that the family home, at the foot of Edinburgh Castle, was attached to his father's brewery and surrounded by other manufacturing concerns: &#145;A more unhealthy residence can scarcely be conceived&#146;  (Gibbon, 1.2). These surroundings almost certainly account for Combe's poor health as a child and his later delicacy. Combe's parents imposed a strict Calvinist regime upon their children and, though Combe was later to reject his religious upbringing, certain aspects of the Calvinist outlook remained central to his thinking. Described as being hard, dry, cold, and as tall, puritanical, and &#145;dissenter-looking&#146;, &#145;he remained all his life within an ascetic mold, forever preoccupied with the virtues of thrift, industry, and order&#146;  (Cooter, 104).<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Combe was initially educated at the parish school of St Cuthbert's and then in 1797 he proceeded to Edinburgh high school. Here he was subjected to severe discipline which involved the liberal use of corporal punishment. While George Comb himself refrained from beating his children, he had no objection to schoolmasters' employing the tawse on them. From 1802 to 1804 Combe attended humanities classes at the University of Edinburgh. His father was anxious to see his sons achieve social advancement, and in the spring of 1804 Combe was articled to a firm of Edinburgh lawyers. After a period as a solicitor's clerk Combe was admitted as a writer to the signet, in January 1812, and began to practise as a lawyer. After the death of his father in 1815 Combe also took charge of the family brewing business for a time.<br>
<br>Combe's relations with his siblings were close. His elder sister, Jean, kept house for him until her death in 1831. His younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6017/', "Andrew Combe")</script> also shared a house with him. George and Andrew Combe became collaborators in what was to become the major enterprise of both men's lives: the promotion of the science of phrenology, with George Combe going on to play a pre-eminent role in &#145;phrenology's transformation from an arcane theory of brain and character to that of a socially respectable vehicle of &#147;progressive&#148; ideas on social life and organization&#146;  (Cooter, 101).<h2>
<a name="Introductiontophrenology"></a>Introduction to phrenology</h2>By his own account Combe's first acquaintance with the doctrines of phrenology was derived from a reading of a damning critique of the system written by John Gordon in the June 1815 issue of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>. Impressed by Gordon's arguments he &#145;regarded [the phrenologists'] doctrines as contemptibly absurd, and their authors as the most disingenuous of men&#146;  (Combe, <span class="italic">A System of Phrenology</span>, v). In 1816, however, Combe attended a dissection of the brain given in the house of a barrister friend by Caspar Spurzheim. He already had some background in the subject through following John Barclay's lectures on anatomy; such dabbling in scientific and medical subjects was not uncommon among early nineteenth-century Edinburgh lawyers. Most of Spurzheim's audience was convinced by his refutation of the criticisms that had been levelled by the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>. Combe subsequently followed Spurzheim's lectures on phrenology. He remained in some doubt, however, about the validity of phrenology's claims until he undertook his own researches; he &#145;appealed to Nature by observation, and at last arrived at complete conviction of the truth of Phrenology&#146;  (ibid., vi).<br>
<br>Combe's researches took the form of both the collection of numerous skull casts supposed to show to advantage the various phrenological organs, and the observation of the heads of individuals whom he encountered. He found himself increasingly asked to demonstrate to others the truths of phrenology he had gleaned by these means, &#145;until at length the applications for an account of the casts became so numerous that I was forced to devote certain days and hours to gratify public curiosity&#146;  (Gibbon, 1.95). Combe thus took on the role of an exponent of the doctrines of phrenology. His early informal presentations to members of his circle eventually developed into courses of public lectures in Edinburgh, Bath, Newcastle, Glasgow, Birmingham, and Aberdeen.<br>
<br>For some time, however, Combe pursued this role as a teacher in parallel with his career as a lawyer, the occupation on which he still relied for the greater part of his income. Additionally, some of his best friends were alarmed &#145;lest I should ruin myself by espousing a cause which was the laughing-stock of all men of reputation&#146;  (Gibbon, 1.96). These fears were to prove unfounded, but such sentiments were an indication of the controversial character of the doctrine with which Combe now became associated. George Combe founded the Edinburgh Phrenological Society in 1820.<br>
<br>Combe's interest in social questions led him in 1820 to visit Robert Owen's model community at New Lanark, but he remained unconvinced about its success. His brother Abram (<i>d</i>. 1827) tried and failed with a similar experiment at Orbiston, Lanarkshire.<h2>
<a name="Writingsandideas"></a>Writings and ideas</h2>Combe's status as the leading British champion of phrenology was enhanced by a series of publications. The first of these was an exposition of the &#145;physiognomical system&#146; of Spurzheim and Franz Josef Gall, which appeared in April 1817. A year later Combe published in the <span class="italic">Literary and Statistical Magazine for Scotland</span> the first of a series of essays that in 1819 were collected into a book entitled <span class="italic">Essays in Phrenology</span>. In 1824 Combe published a further volume: <span class="italic">A System of Phrenology</span>. Both these books passed through several editions. He was also a contributor to, and sometime proprietor of, the <span class="italic">Phrenological Journal</span>.<br>
<br>Combe's most important work was, however, <span class="italic">The Constitution of Man</span> (1828), in which phrenology was placed in the context of a wider scheme for understanding human nature and ameliorating the human condition. The title suggested that it would be a descriptive work, providing an account of human nature. This is indeed what Combe attempted. But <span class="italic">The Constitution of Man</span> was at the same time a prescriptive text: Combe maintained that from a proper understanding of human beings it was possible to derive a comprehensive system of not only personal but also social and political morality.<br>
<br>Crucial to this transition from the factual to the normative was Combe's notion of natural law. He maintained that cause followed effect with the same inevitability in the human as in the physical realm, and that it was as futile and dangerous for an individual or a community to seek to defy the laws of human nature as it was to attempt to override the law of gravity. However, Combe claimed that until recently these laws had been imperfectly understood; it was only with the rise of phrenology that people could obtain an accurate account of human nature and thus a reliable guide to conduct: phrenology was no less than &#145;the greatest and most important discovery ever communicated to mankind&#146;  (Combe, <span class="italic">System of Phrenology</span>, vii). Phrenology revealed, for instance, that social inequality was part of the natural order of things. Different individuals had different aptitudes depending on the unequal development of the various cerebral organs. Individuals should therefore seek phrenological guidance when choosing a career, and employers should make use of cranioscopy when hiring workers. The phrenological doctrine of mind thus endorsed the division of labour by showing the natural basis of this economic arrangement.<br>
<br>Combe was nevertheless critical of certain aspects of the capitalist manufacturing system. He maintained that it encouraged a blind pursuit of short-term profit without regard to longer-term economic and social consequences. This was because capitalists were excessively influenced by their faculties of &#145;acquisitiveness&#146; and &#145;self-esteem&#146;. He defended the rights of workers to form combinations to protect themselves against such exploitation. Moreover, while phrenology might seem to encourage a deterministic attitude to human endowments, Combe denied that the brains of the lower classes were noticeably inferior in size or quality to those of the upper classes. What primarily determined the difference in ability between the two was the disparity in the education of the classes. Given proper training of their cerebral equipment, he believed, there was no reason for workers not to improve their lot and rise to join the middling orders of society.<br>
<br>Combe was also anxious to demonstrate the relevance of phrenology to the reform of the penal system. He opposed capital and corporal punishment and desired that prison discipline be adapted to the moral reform of the individual convict. He maintained that &#145;in dealing with criminals we are dealing with the <i>mind</i>&#146;  (Combe, <span class="italic">Remarks on the Principles of Criminal Legislation</span>, 35) and that penal policy should therefore be directed towards a reform of the offender's mind rather than to taking revenge on his body. Once a criminal's mental faculties were restored by means of education and discipline to a state of proper harmony he or she would no longer be inclined to offend against the law but would become a useful member of the community.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Constitution of Man</span> enjoyed remarkable success, going through numerous editions and selling hundreds of thousands of copies in Europe and the United States. Ironically, it was not the phrenological aspects of the work that proved most popular or had the most durable appeal. It was rather Combe's meliorist, humanitarian, and individualist message that found most resonance among nineteenth-century middle-class readers. These core ideals could be retained while jettisoning Combe's more particular doctrines.<br>
<br>The book also aroused opposition in some quarters. Theologians were quick to point out that Combe's constant insistence upon the centrality of nature and natural law left little room for divine providence. Although Combe denied that he advocated atheism or materialism, these critics touched on an important point. By making nature a virtually self-sufficient source of moral law, Combe rendered the deity at most a remote being with little direct influence on human affairs. The system of rewards and punishments Combe described was of this world and determined by natural forces. <span class="italic">The Constitution of Man</span> can therefore be seen as a precursor to later attempts to create a purely naturalistic understanding of the world and of humanity's place within it.<h2>
<a name="Marriageandforeignlecturetours"></a>Marriage and foreign lecture tours</h2>On 25 September 1833 Combe married Cecilia Siddons (1794&#150;1868), daughter of the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25516/', "Sarah Siddons")</script>. He allegedly subjected both himself and his prospective wife to craniological examination before deciding on the match. With the help of Cecilia's fortune Combe was able to retire from legal practice and devote himself to his activities as a publicist for phrenology. The couple had no children.<br>
<br>Between 1838 and 1840 Combe toured Canada and the United States, seeking to propagate his views by lecturing and by establishing links with like-minded reformers. His impressions of this visit appeared in 1841 as <span class="italic">Notes on the United States</span>. In 1842 Combe travelled to Germany, where he lectured on phrenology in Heidelberg. Due to poor health he was, however, shortly afterwards obliged to give up lecturing. He then bought a house at 45 Melville Street, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Combe continued to publish on various topics; he was, in particular, interested in questions of education policy. In a series of publications he advocated a system of national secular education. A school based on these doctrines was established in Edinburgh; its curriculum included lessons in physiology and phrenology.<h2>
<a name="Scienceandreligion"></a>Science and religion</h2>In 1847 Combe also published a pamphlet on the relations between science and religion; this was subsequently turned into a book. In this work Combe maintained that &#145;Science has banished from [people's] minds belief in the exercise, by the Deity, in our day, of special acts of supernatural power as a means of influencing human affairs, and it has presented a systematic order of nature, which man may study, comprehend, and obey, as a guide to his practical conduct&#146;  (Combe, <span class="italic">On the Relation between Religion and Science</span>, 6).<br>
<br>Towards the end of Combe's life the phrenological movement in Britain was increasingly disrupted by schism and controversy. One faction, of which William Engledue was the chief spokesman, insisted upon a materialistic interpretation of phrenology which was favoured by political radicals. More moderate phrenologists insisted that there was no incompatibility between their science and Christianity. The Combes favoured the latter position. However, George's religious views were sufficiently heterodox for him to be denounced in Edinburgh and elsewhere as an atheist and materialist. This reputation may well have contributed to the failure of his attempt in 1836 to be appointed to the chair of logic at Edinburgh University.<br>
<br>Combe suffered from ill health throughout his life. After a brief final illness, diagnosed as pleuro-pneumonia, he died at Moor Park, Surrey, on 14 August 1858, and was buried in the Dean cemetery, Edinburgh. He was survived by his wife.<br>
