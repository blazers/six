<span class="headword">&Oacute; Briain <span class="st"> [O'Brien]</span>,  Brian  Ruadh</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1277), <span class="occ">king of Thomond</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20444/', "Conchobhar &#211; Briain")</script> and his wife, M&oacute;r, a member of the Mac Con Mara family. He succeeded his father as king in 1268, without opposition according to the <span class="italic">Caithr&eacute;im Thoirdhealbhaigh</span> (&#145;The triumphs of Toirdelbach&#146;), a work written in the mid-fourteenth century to support the claims of the descendants of Brian's brother Tadg against those of Brian. Thomond was at that time in a highly disturbed state, and in 1270 the situation worsened when &Oacute; Briain began to attack the nearby English settlements just north of the Shannon, around Clare and Bunratty. In 1270 he captured Castle Clare. It is notable that at the same time, further north, Aedh &Oacute; Conchobair was making significant progress against the de Burghs in Connacht. The English made four attempts over the next few years to settle the country, taking hostages from Brian &Oacute; Briain, but the situation was obviously unstable and the need for a strong central English authority was apparent. On 26 January 1276 Thomas de Clare, brother of the earl of Gloucester and a close friend of Edward I, was granted the whole of Thomond. He was also close to the Fitzgeralds, being married to the daughter of Maurice fitz Maurice Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1286).<br>
<br>In 1275 Sioda mac Neill mac Conmara, who had proclaimed Brian Ruadh &Oacute; Briain king, rose against him in the interests of Brian's nephew Toirdelbach. Their forces expelled Brian from his stronghold at Clonroad and he was forced to flee across the Shannon with his son Donnchad and others who were loyal to him. Needing an ally, he turned to Thomas de Clare. By this act he brought the rivalry between the Fitzgeralds and the de Burghs into play: it was only a short time before Toirdelbach allied himself with the de Burghs of Connacht. &Oacute; Briain appears to have offered a significant amount of land to Clare for his help: &#145;all lands between Limerick and Athsolus&#146; according to the <span class="italic">Caithr&eacute;im</span>  (Mac Craith, 2.6). Meeting at Limerick, the allied forces successfully took Clonroad, although Toirdelbach was absent at the time. Gathering more support, Brian continued his advance towards Quin (in what is now Clare). The opponents eventually met at Moygressan in 1277, where the allied forces were defeated by Toirdelbach after a long battle. In some disorder, the opposing forces retreated to the new Clare stronghold of Bunratty.<br>
<br>What happened next is unclear. According to the <span class="italic">Caithr&eacute;im</span>, Clare's wife was furious at the death of her brother Patrick at Moygressan, and demanded the execution of Brian &Oacute; Briain. Since her father, Maurice fitz Maurice, was also present, Clare acquiesced and executed Brian on 11 May. The <span class="italic">Caithr&eacute;im</span> says that he was killed on a gibbet. The story that he was drawn between horses is unlikely: it first emerges in the later &Oacute; Ne&iacute;ll <span class="roman">Remonstrance</span> to Pope John XXII, but would almost certainly have been used by the author of the <span class="italic">Caithr&eacute;im</span>, had he known of it, because his chief purpose was to show the perfidy of the Clares and the folly of Brian Ruadh. The more reliable annals of Inisfallen do not give this version, but do suggest that the execution took place with the complicity of some of Brian's own captains.<br>
<br>Although the sons of Brian &Oacute; Briain, led by his heir, Donnchad, took their revenge by attacking the Clares at Quin the next year, they could not do without Clare support for long. The alliance was soon renewed and the civil war continued against Toirdelbach. In 1281 a settlement was made between the two factions but conflict soon flared up again and continued off and on until 1317, when Brian's descendant triumphed. The war had a serious long-term effect on the powers of the region, both Gaelic and English, but the real losers in the long run were the Clares, whose power was undermined by the de Burghs to such an extent that when the dispute was finally settled, the U&iacute; Briain were able to expel both families from Thomond.<br>
