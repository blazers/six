<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Whitelocke, Sir  James</span>  (1570&#150;1632), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 28 November 1570, a twin and the youngest of four sons of Richard Whitelocke (<i>c</i>.1533&#150;1570), a London merchant, and his wife, possibly called Joan (<i>c</i>.1528&#150;1607), previously widow of one Brockhurst and daughter of John Colte of Little Munden, Herefordshire. His eldest brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29298/', "Edmund Whitelocke (1565&#150;1608)")</script>. Their father died trading in France three weeks before the twins' birth. While his brothers pursued adventurous lives (William was killed serving with Sir Francis Drake, while Richard travelled abroad as a merchant), James undertook an ambitious study regime in the face of family financial difficulties and his mother's remarriage on 5 November 1571 to Thomas Price, which proved unhappy. Rich detail of his early life and his career is contained in his &#145;Liber famelicus&#146; or family book, which also offers unusually candid insights into early Stuart law and politics.<br>
<br>Admitted to Merchant Taylors' School in 1575, Whitelocke won a scholarship to St John's College, Oxford, from where he matriculated in July 1588 and where he later became a fellow. His recollections of Oxford suggest the importance of lay, humanist ideals for his education. His college tutor, Rowland Searchfield, subsequently bishop of Bristol, stressed the study of &#145;logique and the artes, but above all of historye&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liber famelicus</span>, 13). Yet he also developed friendships at Oxford with men who were later at the forefront of an Arminian design for the church, including William Laud and John Buckeridge, then fellows at St John's. Having embarked on study for the degree of bachelor of civil laws, its lacklustre formal curriculum led Whitelocke to exploit provision for absences from college in order concurrently to study common law. He entered New Inn in 1590 and progressed to the Middle Temple in March 1593, but gained the BCL on 1 July 1594 and remained a fellow at St John's until 1598. As a student in Oxford and London he struggled financially and undertook work for St John's and as a solicitor to make ends meet. His studious character and an active role in the educational life of the inns presaged his call to the bar on 24 October 1600.<br>
<br>On 10 September 1602 Whitelocke contracted what was to be a long and happy marriage to Elizabeth (1575&#150;1631), daughter of Edward Bulstrode of Hedgerly Bulstrode, Buckinghamshire, and his wife, Cecily Croke. They had seven children, of whom four&#151;Mary, Joan, Dorothy and James&#151;died in infancy; Elizabeth, Cecilia, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29297/', "Bulstrode Whitelocke (1605&#150;1675)")</script> survived. The marriage also provided a house in Fleet Street, a point of entry into the Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire gentry, and valuable professional connections in the bride's uncles John Croke, then judge in Wales and recorder of London, and George Croke, then a bencher at the Inner Temple. In 1606 Whitelocke became recorder of Woodstock, a few miles north of Oxford. Associations developed in the university led to legal work as steward of St John's, Eton College (from 1610), steward of the lands of Westminster Abbey (also from 1610), and the courts baron preserving the liberties of St Martin's-le-Grand in the City (from 1617), and to annual retainers from bishops John Buckeridge, Richard Neile, and John Howson. In London, Whitelocke gained the patronage of Sir Francis Bacon, Sir Julius Caesar, and Sir Lionel Cranfield, moving between the courts of king's bench, chancery, requests, wards, Star Chamber, and constable. This, coupled with assize work centred on Oxford and assisted by the patronage of Sir David Williams and Sir George Croke, ensured that Whitelocke's income grew steadily. From 1607 he purchased properties near Whitechurch and Witney, Oxfordshire, while renting Clewer House near Windsor. Between 1616 and 1620 he strained his resources to buy &pound;9000 worth of property, most notably the manor of Fawley Court, Berkshire, on the Thames 40 miles west of London.<br>
<br>While in London, Whitelocke extended his intellectual interests through involvement with the Society of Antiquaries, preparing papers on topics such as &#145;Antiquity, use and cermony of lawful combats in England&#146; and other matters of native custom. The collapse of the society in 1607 mirrored Whitelocke's own uneasy negotiation of common and civil law jurisdictional rivalries. He was elected MP for Woodstock in 1610, and served on a variety of parliamentary committees deploying his legal knowledge. He assumed a highly visible role in the debates on impositions prompted by <span class="italic">Bate's Case</span> (1606), providing a famous declaration of parliamentary rights which, it has been argued, cut to the heart of constitutional tensions between royal and parliamentary power. Seeking consensus over general principles of taxation, Whitelocke's claim that &#145;the power of the King in Parliament is greater than his power out of Parliament, and doth rule and control it&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 2.482) was never intended to be controversial, but unwittingly contributed to a new language of politics that emerged after his death, in part through its publication in <span class="italic">A Learned and Necessary Argument to Prove that each Subject hath a Propriety in his Goods</span> (1641). In separate legal briefs challenging the jurisdiction of a royal commission into navy corruption (1609) and the jurisdiction of the court of earl marshal (1613), Whitelocke drew himself into a collision course with the Howard family and the lord chancellor, Lord Ellesmere, drawing censure and imprisonment from the crown. On the order of the privy council he was imprisoned from 18 May to 13 June 1613, obtaining release through a personal petition to the king for clemency. Outside parliament, for the four years until his death Ellesmere stymied Whitelocke's political ambitions, earning the latter's criticism that he was &#145;the greatest enemye to the common law that did ever bear office of state in this kingdome&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liber famelicus</span>, 53). Whitelocke was not cowed but continued his opposition to impositions as MP for Woodstock in 1614: his notes challenging the crown over this issue were burned by the king's order following parliament's &#145;addled&#146; and abrupt dissolution.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Whitelocke monitored factional influence on legal appointments, privately criticizing&#151;but ultimately accepting&#151;the growing influence of George Villiers. In 1616 he resigned from a lucrative clerkship of enrolments in the court of king's bench as the now Viscount Villiers wrested control of the office. In 1618 Whitelocke was promoted in a contested election for the recordership of London, backed by a merchant faction, but was rejected by the king in favour of Robert Heath, preferred candidate of Villiers the new marquess of Buckingham. Buckingham appears to have borne no grudge against Whitelocke, appointing him to commissions of the peace for Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire in 1617 and 1618.<br>
<br>In 1619 Whitelocke was made a bencher of the Middle Temple and autumn reader. Choosing the thirteenth chapter of Henry VIII's statute on benefices, he addressed the contentious issues of patronage, non-residence, and plurality, mounting a moderate appeal for the rights of crown and clergy. The reading was widely copied. The following year he was appointed recorder of Westminster and St Martin's-le-Grand (23 May), was created serjeant-at-law, and on 29 October 1620 he was knighted. He resigned his stewardships at Westminster Abbey and at St Martin's-le-Grand on 4 May 1621. He sat again in the 1621 parliament as MP for Woodstock, but was largely absent, concentrating instead on judicial duties. With Buckingham's support, in June 1620 Whitelocke had been appointed chief justice of Chester. Over four years he administered justice in the county palatine of Chester and those border counties within the jurisdiction of the council in the marches of Wales. While financially lucrative (yielding over &pound;1000 per annum), Whitelocke's relations with William Compton, earl of Northampton, president of the council, were poor and led in October 1624 to his removal from Chester to a puisne judgeship in the court of king's bench. He rode the Oxford circuit in 1625, the midland circuit in 1625, the northern in 1627 and 1628, and returned to the Oxford circuit from 1629 until the year of his death. He left his recorderships at Westminster and St Martin's-le-Grand on 8 December 1628. His relations with the crown were strained when Charles I, seeking revenue to fight in Europe, revoked and reduced his circuit fees from 1625 to 1628, to Whitelocke's considerable unhappiness. In this period Whitelocke was also drawn into constitutional test cases which damaged his legal reputation. In the <i>Five Knights' case</i> (1627) Whitelocke supported the crown's right to imprison subjects without providing explicit cause, but also asserted the subject's right to legal redress through writ of habeas corpus. In <i>Eliot's case</i> (1629) Whitelocke initially resisted crown attempts to impose conditions for bail, but then acquiesced in royal demands for security of good behaviour. Stressing the &#145;supereminent&#146; power of the crown, Whitelocke dismissed John Eliot's claim for parliamentary privilege from prosecution, accusing him of &#145;sowing sedition to the destruction of the commonwealth&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 3.308). Only a spirited defence of these actions by his son, Bulstrode, prevented parliament from posthumously denouncing and fining Whitelocke.<br>
<br>While his wife was regarded a puritan, Whitelocke adopted a more moderate Calvinist stance, wherever possible avoiding judgment of those high-church clerics who supported him throughout his career. The Arminian vision of his friends put this approach under strain in the 1620s, as Buckeridge and Laud gathered multiple livings to themselves, leading Whitelocke to defend Buckeridge's pluralism to posterity in the &#145;Liber famelicus&#146;, but to challenge Laud's retention of a college parsonage on behalf of St John's in 1621. In 1628 Whitelocke upheld Bishop Neile's expulsion of Peter Smart from Durham Cathedral for preaching against high-church ceremonial. In 1629 he avoided the king's order to the judges of king's bench to release Jesuits arrested at Clerkenwell College, pleading absence from court during crucial parts of the hearing. In 1631 Whitelocke was openly criticized by junior Arminian clerics at the consecration of his private chapel; Bulstrode Whitelocke later suggested that his father privately thought William Laud &#145;too full of fire, though a just and good man&#146;, and worried that his &#145;want of experience in state matters, and his too much zeal for the Church, and heat, if he proceeded in the ways he was then in, would set this nation on fire&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 37343, fol. 201<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Whitelocke's life was dominated by his ambition to leave a tangible legacy to his family through professional achievement. Despite a &#145;grave&#146; concern for his children, it is clear that he found time to &#145;sport&#146; and sing with them; Bishop John Williams remarked that &#145;no subject in Christendom had better musicke then Judge Whitelocke had in his house&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Bulstrode Whitelocke</span>, 44&#150;5, 51, 65). His son remembered him as a man &#145;full of witt and pleasantness especially att meales, and as there was occasion his discourse was mixed with excellent learning&#146;  (ibid., 66). Predicting his own passing upon the death of his wife on 28 May 1631, Whitelocke retired from public life to settle the details of his estate, leaving Fawley Court and &pound;4500 as well as plate and household goods to his son, &pound;2500 for Cecilia's marriage portion, &pound;10 a quarter to his married daughter Elizabeth, and &pound;100 to build a monument to his wife and himself (which survives) in the south transept of Fawley church. He died on 22 June 1632.<br>
