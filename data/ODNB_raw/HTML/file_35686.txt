<span class="headword">Raverty,  Henry George</span>  (1825&#150;1906), <span class="occ">army officer and orientalist</span>, born at Falmouth on 31 May 1825, was the son of Peter Raverty of co. Tyrone, a surgeon in the navy. His mother belonged to the family of Drown of Falmouth. Educated at Falmouth and Penzance, at fifteen or sixteen he resolved to become a soldier. The interest of Sir Charles Lemon secured him a cadetship, and he sailed for India. Appointed to the Welch fusiliers, he soon (in 1843) transferred to the 3rd Bombay native infantry. With his regiment he was present at the siege of Multan in 1848; he served in Gujarat and in the first frontier expedition in 1850 against tribes on the Swat border. Raverty held a civil appointment as assistant commissioner in the Punjab from 1852 to 1859. He was promoted major in 1863 and retired from the army the following year. He settled in England, first near Ottery St Mary, Devon, and afterwards at Grampound Road, Cornwall. In 1865 he married Fanny Vigurs, only daughter of Commander George Pooley RN; they had no children.<br>
<br>Raverty pursued until the end of his long life various oriental studies, which he had begun in India. Although he lacked academic training, he was gifted with scholarly instincts, and devoted himself to linguistic, historical, geographical, and ethnological study. In India he first learned Hindustani, Persian, Gujarati, and Marathi and for his knowledge of these languages gained the &#145;high proficiency&#146; prize of 1000 rupees from his government. A <span class="italic">Thesaurus of English Hindustani Technical Terms</span> (1859) proved his linguistic aptitude in Hindustani. His transfer to the north-west frontier at Peshawar in 1849 had meanwhile directed his chief attention to the Pushtu or Afghan language, history, and ethnology. To the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the Geographical Society of Bombay, Raverty contributed in 1851 &#145;An account of the city and province of Peshawar&#146;, illustrated with maps and sepia sketches. In order to acquire practical knowledge of the Pushtu tongue he had to collect, arrange, and systematize almost the whole of the needful grammatical and lexical material. In 1855 he published his <span class="italic">Grammar of the Pushto or Language of the Afghans</span>, which Dr Dorn, the eminent orientalist of St Petersburg, warmly commended. In 1860, besides a second and improved edition of the grammar (3rd edn, 1867), he published his monumental <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Pushto or Afghan Language</span> (2nd edn, 1867), and his admirable anthology of Pushtu prose and poetry entitled <span class="italic">Gulshan i Roh</span>. He was as well acquainted with Pushtu literature as with the spoken language. In 1862 there followed <span class="italic">Selections from the Poetry of the Afghans from the Sixteenth to the Nineteenth Century</span> in an English translation.<br>
<br>After leaving India Raverty published in 1871 a translation of <span class="italic">Aesop's Fables</span> into Pushtu, and in 1880 a <span class="italic">Pushtu Manual</span>. Between 1881 and 1888 he issued in four instalments his ponderous work <span class="italic">Notes on Afghanistan and Baluchistan</span>. This book was never generally available and remains little known except to specialists. Although it contains a great deal of useful geographical and ethnographic data, Raverty's lack of formal academic training is most evident in this volume. The 734-page work has no table of contents, no maps, and no bibliography; only a serviceable index saves it for research purposes. Sources quoted in the text are rarely identified in a satisfactory manner and one is frequently at a loss to know whether Raverty is quoting from a manuscript or speaking from his own knowledge.<br>
<br>Simultaneously Raverty was working at his translation of the <span class="italic">Tabakat-i-Nasiri</span> which was published in 1881. It is a rendering from Persian into English of Minhaj ibn Siraj's work on general history, with special reference to the Muslim dynasties of Asia, and particularly those of Ghur, Ghaznah, and Hindustan, <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 810&#150;1260. By his critical remarks and copious illustrative notes derived from his wide reading of other eastern authors, Raverty vastly enhanced the historical value and completeness of Minhaj's work.<br>
<br>Other of Raverty's valuable studies appeared chiefly in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Asiatic Society</span>, Bengal. Among these papers were &#145;Remarks on the origin of the Afghan people&#146; (1854); &#145;Notes on Kafiristan and the Siah-Posh Kafir tribes&#146; (1858); &#145;On the language of the Siah-Posh Kafirs of Kafiristan&#146; (1864); &#145;An account of Upper Kashghar and Chitral&#146; (1864); &#145;Memoir of the author of the Tabak&#257;t i N&#257;sir&#299;&#146; (1882); &#145;The Mihran of Sind and its tributaries&#151;a geographical study&#146; (1892); and &#145;Tibbat three hundred and sixty-five years ago&#146; (1895). &#145;Muscovite proceedings on the Afghan frontier&#146; was reprinted from the <span class="italic">United Service Gazette</span> in 1885.<br>
<br>Raverty died at his home, Florence Villa, Grampound Road, Cornwall, on 20 October 1906. His wife survived him. Raverty, whose frankness in controversy cost him many friends, received small recognition in his lifetime from his fellow countrymen, but his immense labours gave him a high reputation among foreign oriental scholars. At his death he had no fewer than seven important works either completed in manuscript or in preparation, among them &#145;A history of Herat and its dependencies and the annals of Khur&#257;s&#257;n from the earliest down to modern times&#146;, based upon the works of eastern historians, which are treated with critical acumen; the six bulky quarto volumes of manuscript, the result of fifty years' research, are now at the India Office.<br>
