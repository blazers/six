<span class="headword">Kirton,  Edmund</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1466), <span class="occ">abbot of Westminster</span>, was born into the Coppledike family of Lincolnshire, and his surname derives from one or other of the two villages named Kirton in that county. Joan Barton, of &#145;Cotes&#146; (Hertfordshire), who bequeathed to him a silver chalice in 1437, was a cousin, and Edward Kirton, described as a canon, who is also mentioned in her will, may have been a brother. Kirton entered the Benedictine monastery in 1403&#150;4 and was sent to Gloucester College, Oxford, in 1407, two years before his ordination to the priesthood: intellectually, he was outstanding. His long residence at Oxford, during which he proceeded DTh, culminated in his appointment as <i>prior studentium</i> in 1426. In the course of his Oxford years, he was employed several times on business for the provincial chapter of English black monks, and it may also have been in this period that he preached before Pope Martin V (<i>r</i>. 1417&#150;31), presumably at Rome, an event recorded in his epitaph.<br>
<br>After Kirton's return to Westminster, he served as sacrist (1433&#150;40) and so had the opportunity of proving himself in a major office. Anthony Wood's belief that he was summoned to Basel in 1437 to answer a charge of heresy is without foundation. In the abbatial election of 1440, which was conducted by scrutiny, he obtained fewer votes than Prior Nicholas Ashby, but, assisted by a letter of recommendation from the University of Oxford, was provided to the abbacy by Pope Eugenius IV (<i>r</i>. 1431&#150;47) later in the year. The demands of office, manageable to the sacrist, quickly proved too much for the abbot, and in 1444 visitors appointed by the provincial chapter suspended Kirton. His offence on this occasion was, it appears, maladministration. Moral charges, including fornication, followed two years later, and, in respect of these, Kirton underwent at least the first stages of a trial before papal judges. He survived both these crises and later allegations by Ralph Aleyn, a monk of Westminster, that he had committed Aleyn to prison on a trumped-up charge of theft. The debts that he left to his successor, George Norwych (<i>d</i>. 1469), were occasioned at least in part by circumstances beyond his control: the need for expensive repairs to the monks' dormitory and to the rose window in the south transept of the abbey church. Yet Kirton lacked the businesslike qualities needed to take the monastery through a difficult financial period. He resigned in 1462, probably on the grounds of old age, and was granted a generous pension of &pound;166 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. per annum. It is not known where he spent his retirement. He died on 3 October 1466 and was buried in St Andrew's Chapel, in the north transept of the abbey church. The brass on his altar-tomb, which bore his family arms, survived into the eighteenth century. An engraving is reproduced in Dart's <span class="italic">Westmonasterium, or, The history and antiquities of the abbey church of St. Peter's, Westminster</span>  (Dart, 2, facing p. 2).<br>
