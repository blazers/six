<span class="headword">Fowle, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1637, <em>d.</em> 1692), <span class="occ">goldsmith and banker</span>, was baptized on 6 January 1637, the fifth son of Edward Fowle, a yeoman, and his wife, Barbara, of Stanton St Bernard, Wiltshire. The family held enough leasehold and copyhold land directly to support the two elder sons, Edward and Henry, and to provide premiums to apprentice the next three boys, Daniel, Robert, and Thomas, to London goldsmiths. Details of Fowle's education are unknown until he was apprenticed on 12 August 1652, at the age of fifteen, for eight years, to James Pewte, a &#145;shopkeeping goldsmith&#146; in Tower Street. He became free of the Goldsmiths' Company in 1660, when he probably opened a shop in the vicinity of Temple Bar in Fleet Street, where he was established at the Black Lion by 1667, the year in which he became a liveryman of the company. It was this period that first saw the provision of credit accounts and the development of the clearing system which, based on the agreement of a ring of goldsmiths to accept each other's &#145;notes&#146;, in effect to honour third-party debts, was the vital step in the establishment of goldsmith banking. These developments can be traced in Fowle's career. His surviving &#145;1664 daybook&#146; charts an emerging business serving a burgeoning clientele of gentry and lawyers living both in the west of the City and beyond, towards Westminster and the court at Whitehall. Fowle's trade was diverse, and included the sale of plate and jewellery, bullion exchange, and some provision of financial services. In the summer of 1665, when the plague was at its height in the City, Fowle closed his shop; he reopened in January the following year. Trade recovered quickly, and on 9 June 1666 he married Jane, the daughter of Roger Norton of St Anne Blackfriars, a prosperous London stationer. Her marriage portion of &pound;900 provided a significant addition to the capital of the business. In early September the great fire destroyed much of the City but stopped just short of Fowle at Temple Bar. The goldsmiths to the east were not so fortunate, for Lombard Street was reported to be &#145;all in dust&#146;, which must have given, at least for a while, a competitive advantage to those in Fleet Street.<br>
<br>After the great fire, Fowle started to sell the most fashionable plate, which was commissioned from Arthur Manwaring, a leading English silversmith, and from Wolfgang Howzer and Jacob Bodendick, two &#145;strangers&#146; working in the &#145;new&#146; or &#145;French fashion&#146;. The pattern of his trade remained broadly similar for the next few years, his main profits being generated by the sale of plate and jewellery with a limited return on bullion dealings and interest on loans. In 1672 the &#145;stop of the exchequer&#146; (when the repayment of loans to lenders was suspended) was a severe setback to a number of Lombard Street goldsmiths. Their difficulties may have helped the emerging Fleet Street goldsmith bankers such as Fowle, despite their client base being substantially different. Perhaps it is not coincidental that the first clearing accounts between Thomas Fowle and Robert Blanchard (later Child's Bank) appeared in Blanchard's ledger for 1672; the moneys cleared between them rose steadily to more than &pound;17,000 in 1679. There were similar arrangements to accept and clear notes with other goldsmith bankers. These included most of those that kept &#145;running cashes&#146; listed in the vicinity of Fleet Street in the <span class="italic">Little London Directory</span> of 1677.<br>
<br>Fowle's banking activities grew steadily, with net profits in the late 1670s in excess of &pound;1000, raising to &pound;3000 by the end of the next decade. Part of these were retained for expansion but some were used to purchase land, particularly in the west country. Despite the growth in banking activity, Fowle continued to employ a number of subcontractors and specialist craftsmen to make a wide range of plate and jewellery. In 1681 William Fowle (1658&#150;1684), the second son of Thomas Fowle's eldest brother Edward, finished his apprenticeship with Arthur Manwaring and was established with a house and shop in Hungerford Street, off the Strand. Thomas financed his nephew's trade, taking most of his production, until William's untimely death in 1684. Prominent among William's plate were splendid toilet services, either finely cast and chased with mythological scenes, such as the Calverley set in the Victoria and Albert Museum, or flat-chased with lively chinoiseries, such as that in the Metropolitan Museum, New York. The cast and chased toilet services are considered among the finest surviving examples of Caroline goldsmithing.<br>
<br>Fowle was known for his strong tory sympathies and played an active role in the life of the Goldsmiths' Company and the City. In 1682 he was elected to the court of assistants of the company. In 1686 he became an alderman and was soon after chosen as sheriff and knighted. The following year he became prime warden of the Goldsmiths' Company, but was removed from this office and discharged as alderman at a time when, having dissolved parliament, James II replaced many opposed to him. On the accession of William III, Fowle was again elected prime warden, but declined to serve. However, he co-operated with the new regime, acting as a member of the committee of City financiers that negotiated loans for the government in 1690; he also lent some &pound;20,500 himself. He was elected member of parliament for Devizes in the tory interest in March 1690, but the proceedings of the election were disputed and he was unseated on petition the following December. Although out of parliament, he was re-elected an alderman in 1691. He died &#145;of an apoplexy&#146; on 11 November 1692 and was buried on the 24th in his parish church of St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, with very considerable pomp  (Luttrell, 614, 623). His wife survived him, and died on 2 January 1707.<br>
<br>Fowle was clearly firm in his business dealings, as he notes, for example, in his pocketbook: &#145;Tho. Wotton my sarvant is indebted to me By Negligence in Letting a woman cheat Him of Five Guinys&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C104/120, pt 1). Nevertheless, he was generous in his will, for, after making ample provision for his widow and his only child, Susan (who married Jonathan Cope), he left land and money to fifteen relatives and made several charitable bequests. He also left &pound;200 to &#145;my old servant&#146; Thomas Farmer, his bookkeeper, who continued to serve at the Black Lion, under Robert Fowle, the son of Thomas's brother Robert, in partnership with Thomas Wotton, his former apprentice. His nephew Robert, as residuary legatee, was left, according to a contemporary report, &pound;10,000 &#145;to continue that trade, with the house and shop in Fleet Street where he lived, so his dealings seems the same as if Sir Thomas was yet living&#146;  (W. Ball to Sir Cyril Wyche, 24 Jan 1693, National Archives of Ireland, Wyche MSS).<br>
