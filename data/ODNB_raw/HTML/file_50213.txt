<span class="headword">Hay, Sir  John Charles Dalrymple</span>, third baronet  (1821&#150;1912), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was born at 113 Princes Street, Edinburgh, on 11 February 1821, eldest surviving son of Sir James Dalrymple Hay, second baronet (1788&#150;1861), and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Maxwell (<i>d</i>. 1821). Hay's career was dominated by his close family ties and friendship with prominent Scottish naval officers, including the Cochranes and Sir Houston Stewart. In 1833 Hay entered Rugby School. In 1834 he joined the navy as a first-class volunteer aboard the frigate <i>Thalia</i>, flagship of Rear-Admiral Campbell on the Cape of Good Hope station. In 1835 and 1836 he served in the brig <i>Trinculo</i> on the west coast of Africa anti-slavery patrol, and was very nearly turned out of the navy by Sir Robert Peel's brief administration, which disapproved of his entry by the preceding Admiralty board. After his return to Britain in 1836 Hay was briefly appointed to the <i>Minden</i> (72 guns) in the channel squadron before he joined the frigate <i>Imogene</i> (Captain Henry Bruce) for the South America and Pacific station. On 25 January 1837 he became a midshipman. He returned to Britain in November 1839 and then joined the <i>Benbow</i> (72 guns, Captain Houston Stewart) in the Mediterranean. During the Syrian campaign of 1840 he was noticed for his conduct during the boat attack on Tortosa on 26 August. Having been passed for lieutenant on 17 February 1841, he joined the steamer <i>Spiteful</i> (Captain William Maitland) for the China station in late 1842. Despite a severe illness Hay remained on the station, relying on his relative, the new commander-in-chief Admiral Sir Thomas Cochrane, for promotion. In October 1844 he was appointed by Cochrane his flag lieutenant aboard the <i>Agincourt</i>, where he served for a year before promotion to commander of the <i>Wolverine</i> on 28 August 1846. He returned home in 1847.<br>
<br>On 18 August 1847 Hay married the Hon. Eliza Napier, third daughter of William Napier, eighth Baron Napier. He was appointed to the brig <i>Columbine</i> in December, and joined her in Chinese waters. In 1849 he engaged and destroyed the fleet of the notorious pirate Shap'ngtzai. In the first action with a pirate squadron, on 28&#150;9 September 1849, he was helped by the P. &amp; O. steamer <i>Canton</i>. The main pirate fleet was pursued by Hay, with the steamers <i>Fury</i> and <i>Phlegethon</i>, and destroyed in the Tonkin River. There were no British casualties. For this service Hay was promoted post captain on 20 January 1850. He attended the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth in 1851, and saw no further service until 1853, when he was appointed captain of HMS <i>Victory</i>, flagship of Vice-Admiral Sir Thomas Cochrane at Portsmouth. Early in 1854 Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Napier applied for him as flag captain for the Baltic fleet, but Cochrane and Sir James Graham, the first lord, retained him at Portsmouth to supervise the manning of ships being fitted for service.<br>
<br>At the end of 1854 Hay took command of the steam screw battleship <i>Hannibal</i> (91 guns) in the Black Sea as flag captain to Rear-Admiral Houston Stewart. He took part in the capture of Kerch and Kinburn and the re-embarkation of the Crimean army. When the <i>Hannibal</i> paid off in October 1856 Hay followed Stewart, and in 1857, after an illness, took command of the sailing battleship <i>Indus</i> (70 guns), flagship on the North America and West Indies station. He left the <i>Indus</i> in September 1859 and came ashore for the last time. In October he served on the royal commission to investigate the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich, and the following year he chaired the committee to inquire into armour plate, which sat for nearly five years. This resulted in his election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1864.<br>
<br>On 19 March 1861 he became third baronet, and in March 1862 Hay was elected Conservative MP for Wakefield and continued in parliament until July 1865. His main themes were the crowded state of the navy list, and the inadequacy of the navy. He secured the payment of the prize money for the capture of Kerch in 1862. In June 1864 he became chairman of the Millwall Shipbuilding Company and several other commercial concerns. On 6 April 1866 he was promoted rear-admiral, missing the offer of a ship. A month later he was elected for Stamford, a seat at the disposal of Lord Exeter, which he retained for the next fourteen years. In 1866 he was appointed junior naval lord in the Derby ministry, and by threatening to resign helped to secure four new battleships, which did not endear him to Disraeli, who, as chancellor, wanted to keep down the estimates. He directed the transport arrangements of the Abyssinia campaign.<br>
<br>On 1 March 1870 Hay, who had not served afloat as an admiral and was only forty-nine years old, was placed on the list of officers to be retired under the reform introduced by the Liberal first lord, Hugh Childers. When Hay protested in parliament, Childers offered him the East Indies command, but this was refused on the advice of Disraeli. Hay had applied for a command while at the board, but had been dissuaded by his political colleagues. He was offered the post of first or second naval lord in 1874 by Disraeli, but turned this down as he believed that retired officers should not be placed in authority over those still serving. Disraeli did not reappoint him to the active list&#151;Hay's friend Henry Corry had promised to do so, but he had died in 1873. Hay remained on the retired list, serving as chairman of the explosive substances committee. In 1874 he published <span class="italic">Ashanti and the Gold Coast</span>, which dealt with an area he had visited in his youth (1834&#150;5). During the 1878 Russian war scare, Hay advised Disraeli to reinforce the fleet by purchasing four ironclads that were being built in Britain for foreign powers. In 1880 Hay lost his seat at Stamford, but was returned for the Wigton burghs until he stepped down in 1886. He was made CB (1869), KCB (1885), and GCB (1902). He was one of the last admirals to believe that it was possible for a naval officer to be first lord. In 1898 he published his memoirs, <span class="italic">Lines from my Log-Books</span>. He died at his London home, 108 St George's Square, on 28 January 1912, leaving three sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>Hay entered the navy surrounded by relatives and close friends, and his marriage to a daughter of Lord Napier increased the family group to include almost every significant Scottish sea officer. An able, hard-working, and well-connected officer, Hay reached the rank of captain through the support of Sir Thomas Cochrane and his own exertions. He never commanded a private ship as a captain, and despite his talents and youth was denied the opportunity for a flag appointment. His later career was dominated by tory politics, and by the animus against him and the navy generally that was evident in Disraeli's conduct before 1878.<br>
