<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Taylor,  Jeremy</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1613, <em>d.</em> 1667), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Down and Connor and religious writer</span>, was born at Cambridge, where he was baptized at Trinity Church on 15 August 1613. He was the third son of Nathaniel Taylor, a barber, and Mary Dean. The Taylors were a well-established Cambridge family: Nathaniel and his father, Edmond (<i>d</i>. 1607), were both churchwardens of Trinity Church; at the time of Jeremy's birth the family was probably living at a house known as the Black Bear, opposite Trinity Church, but at some date after 1621 they moved to the Wrestlers' Inn in Petty Cury, in the parish of St Andrew the Great. Jeremy was instructed in grammar and mathematics by his father, and later educated at the Perse School under its master Thomas Lovering. He entered Gonville and Caius College as a sizar, or poor scholar, on 18 August 1626 and matriculated on 17 March 1627. His tutor was Thomas Bachcroft, who later became master of the college. Taylor was elected a scholar on the Perse foundation at Michaelmas 1628 and took his BA in 1631. In 1633 he was elected to a Perse fellowship of the college and was ordained, although still under twenty-one years old. He proceeded to an MA in 1634 and was appointed a praelector in rhetoric by the master of Caius.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Apparently Taylor came to the attention of Archbishop William Laud when he stood in for Thomas Risden, his university friend, as a lecturer at St Paul's Cathedral. According to George Rust's sermon at Taylor's funeral, Laud had Taylor preach before him and was impressed, especially by his quick-witted response to the remark that he was very young: Taylor &#145;humbly begged his grace to pardon that fault, and promised, if he lived, he would mend it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.17). Laud organized his preferment within the University of Oxford. On 20 October 1635 Taylor was admitted MA from University College. A few days later Laud recommended him for a vacant fellowship at All Souls, and when Gilbert Sheldon, the warden, objected to his election on a technicality, Laud used the authority which devolved to him as college visitor to ensure that Taylor was admitted&#151;first as a probationary and then, on 14 January 1636, as a permanent fellow. Soon afterwards Taylor was appointed chaplain to Laud and a chaplain-in-ordinary to Charles I.<br>
<br>Taylor was a rising star and inevitably attracted adverse as well as positive comment. There were rumours of crypto-popery. In 1641 he was to be accused of &#145;teaching that a man cannot be saved without confession to a priest&#146;  (Milton, 74n.). His friendship with the Franciscan Christopher Davenport gave rise to suspicions. Perhaps these rumours were allayed by the Gunpowder Plot sermon Taylor preached at the university church of St Marys, Oxford, on 5 November 1638. Dedicated to Laud, the published sermon was a virulent and historically detailed attack on the treachery of Roman Catholics. Although Davenport told Anthony Wood that Taylor had &#145;expressed some sorrow for those things he had said against them&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.782), Taylor remained a fierce critic of &#145;popery&#146; throughout his life. In a letter from the late 1650s published as part of <span class="italic">A Dissuasive from Popery</span> (1664) he described Rome as &#145;a church that protects itself by arts of subtilty [<i>sic</i>] and arms, by violence and persecuting&#146;, and states that its erroneous doctrines pandered to evil inclinations: the Church of England was a far safer path, yet Taylor could not bring himself to say that all Catholics were damned  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 11.187, 197). Taylor was a combative preacher, and even his admirers voiced the occasional reservation: William Chillingworth told a mutual friend that, for all his qualities, Taylor:<blockquote>wants much of the ethicall part of a discourser, and slights too much many times the arguments of those he discourses with; but this is a fault he would quickly leave, if he had a friend that would discreetly tell him of it. (<span class="italic">Holy Living</span>, xvii)</blockquote>In 1638 Bishop Juxon preferred Taylor to the rectory of Uppingham in Rutland. Taylor was instituted into the living on 23 March 1638 and took up residence in his parish; the parish registers attest to his concern for his flock and his church, and his pulpit and paten survive in the parish church. It was at Uppingham on 27 May 1639 that he married Phoebe Langsdale (<i>d</i>. 1651), daughter of Gervase Langsdale of Holborn, London, and sister to Edward Langsdale (1619&#150;1684), who had been one of Taylor's pupils at Cambridge in 1633. Taylor and Phoebe had several children: William, who was buried at Uppingham on 28 May 1642; two other sons (George? and Richard), who succumbed to smallpox in the winter of 1656&#150;7; Charles, who survived to adulthood only to die a few days after his father; and two daughters, Phoebe, who never married, and Mary, who in 1662 married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18108/', "Francis Marsh")</script>, dean of Armagh and later archbishop of Dublin. When John Evelyn met Mary in 1680, &#145;she seemed to be a knowing woman beyond the ordinary talent of her sex&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Evelyn</span>, 4.19).<h2>
<a name="Civilwarandinterregnum"></a>Civil war and interregnum</h2>Jeremy Taylor was not able to enjoy the life of a parish priest for long. The outbreak of the civil war impelled him to join Charles I. Although details of his movements are not entirely clear, and depend heavily upon Wood's account, it seems that he joined the king at Nottingham and then accompanied the court to Oxford. On 1 November 1642 Taylor received a DD from the University of Oxford by royal mandate, probably in recognition of his recently completed book <span class="italic">The Sacred Order and Offices of Episcopacy</span> (Oxford, 1642). After Charles I had allegedly declined the honour, this outspoken book was dedicated to Christopher Hatton, later Lord Hatton, royalist courtier and politician, and a stalwart patron of Taylor for several years to come. In 1644 there appeared from the university printer at Oxford <span class="italic">The Psalter of David</span>, an anonymous work that was frequently attributed to Hatton and yet which bears Taylor's literary hallmark. Wood writes of Taylor as preaching frequently before the court at Oxford in the early 1640s and accompanying the royal army as a chaplain. There are no more entries by Taylor in the register at Uppingham after the summer of 1642, but it was not until May 1644 that his living was finally sequestered and the royalist <span class="italic">Mercurius Aulicus</span> could luridly report his house plundered, his estate seized, and his family put out. Since the living of Uppingham was effectively lost to him in 1642, his institution to the rectory of Overstone, Northamptonshire, in 1643 may have been intended as some form of compensation, but there is no evidence of his residence there, and his successor was in possession by May 1647. Meanwhile the fortunes of war had gone against Taylor. In January or February 1645 he was taken prisoner after the defeat of the royalist force under Colonel Charles Gerard outside Cardigan Castle in Wales. His prominence was such that the parliamentary propagandists crowed at the capture of this &#145;most spruce neat formalist, a very ginger-bread Idoll, an Arminian in print&#146;  (<span class="italic">Walker rev.</span>, 302).<br>
<br>Taylor was probably free again by April and able to resume his scholarly and clerical life. Whether his role as a military chaplain had brought him to south-west Wales or he had retired there looking for peace, he found refuge as a teacher at a school in the grandly named Newton Hall in the parish of Llanfihangel Aberbythych, Carmarthenshire. Set up by William Nicholson, the ejected vicar of nearby Llandeilo, with the assistance of William Wyatt, this school prepared the sons of local gentlemen for university. In 1646 Taylor and Wyatt wrote and published <span class="italic">A New and Easie Institution of Grammar</span> (Oxford, 1646), and the same year Taylor's <span class="italic">Discourse Concerning Prayer ex tempore</span> also appeared at Oxford. It is uncertain whether Taylor's presence at the school brought him into the orbit of Richard Vaughan, second earl of Carbery, or the school owed its location and even existence to the proximity of Carbery's mansion. Whichever it was, Taylor soon became chaplain to the Carbery household and a resident at Golden Grove (Gelli-aur), a few miles south-west of Llandeilo and to the east of Carmarthen. Carbery's early Elizabethan house was palatial. It was taxed at thirty hearths in 1670, and if, as has been suggested, the engraved frontispiece to Taylor's book <span class="italic">Golden Grove</span> includes a depiction of the house in an idealization of the Tywi valley, it was a delightful retreat  (Gathorne-Hardy and Williams, 63&#150;5). Carbery had retired here from politics in 1644 after a less than distinguished military career as a royalist general. He enjoyed a parliamentary pardon and the protection of the earl of Essex. Taylor savoured a congenial atmosphere of piety&#151;especially with Frances, countess of Carbery&#151;and bookishness.<br>
<br>During the next few years Taylor produced a series of important works. <span class="italic">The Liberty of Prophesying</span> (1647) was the first and perhaps most uncharacteristic, as it argued for religious toleration. Then &#145;weary and toiled with rowing up and down in the seas of questions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.xiii), Taylor turned his mind to winning people over to Christianity rather than to a party, and produced a series of devotional works, <span class="italic">The Great Exemplar</span> (1649), <span class="italic">Holy Living</span> (1650), and <span class="italic">Holy Dying</span> (1651). The last two were dedicated to Carbery. Poignantly <span class="italic">Holy Dying</span> was intended as tribute to the countess of Carbery, but before Taylor could finish it, she died in childbirth on 9 October 1650. Taylor preached and later published a funeral sermon for the &#145;dear departed Saint&#146;. When he came to dedicate <span class="italic">Holy Dying</span> (which was entered in the Stationers' register on 23 June 1651, while Thomason dated his copy 3 September 1651), Taylor added a personal note by remarking on his own sad experience of grief. Apparently his wife, Phoebe, had died in the first half of 1651.<br>
<br>To judge by his publications, Taylor spent the next year or two assiduously preaching at Golden Grove and preparing two volumes of sermons &#145;for all the Sundays of the year&#146;, which were published as <span class="italic">Eniautos</span> in 1651 and 1653. Yet even in the fastnesses of Carmarthenshire, religious controversy was alive. Taylor found himself at odds with a Jesuit, John Sarjeant, over the doctrine of the eucharist. By April 1653 Taylor had completed <span class="italic">The real presence and spirituall of Christ in the blessed sacrament, proved against the doctrine of transubstantiation</span> and sent the manuscript to Brian Duppa, the deprived bishop of Salisbury. By November Duppa had received a copy of the printed book and recommended it to Sir Justinian Isham:<blockquote>You will find it to be a discourse occasioned by a conference he had with a Jesuit, against whom he hath argued with so much sharpness as if all his study had been in controversies, and yet hath framed his bookes of devotion so as if he understood nothing of them. (<span class="italic">Correspondence of &hellip; Duppa and &hellip; Isham</span>, 75)</blockquote>There were many calls on Taylor's time and energy, as can be glimpsed from another of Duppa's letters. On 9 May 1654 he wrote that Taylor<blockquote>hath been lately at London with an intention to make use of some books for the perfecting of a very good work which he hath now in hand. But being here, the labours of the pulpit took him off from the care of the press: for he was not suffer'd to be in quiet. Preach he must, both in season and out of season, till at last being wearied out with it, he is retired back to the Golden Grove. (<span class="italic">Correspondence of &hellip; Duppa and &hellip; Isham</span>, 88)</blockquote>Taylor had conceived a grand project, a work of casuistry or &#145;cases of conscience&#146;, which would be his <i>magnum opus</i> and a complete protestant answer to the many Roman Catholic manuals of casuistry. His correspondence of the 1650s contains frequent references to his progress on the book: part one was complete late in 1654; in April 1656 the book, entitled <span class="italic">Ductor dubitantium</span>, was entered in the Stationers' register; parts of the text were being set up on the printing presses in the winter of 1656&#150;7; he was still hard at work in 1659, by which time he was in Ireland; and the huge tome finally appeared in 1660. Throughout these years Taylor's life was precarious. Money was always a problem. He depended on the generosity of sympathizers and patrons, some of whom had fallen on hard times themselves or even, like Hatton, gone into exile. Through Duppa he received at least one donation from Sir Justinian Isham; John Evelyn would be another benefactor, and there was some rather tense financial arrangement with Gilbert Sheldon. Taylor's personal liberty was far from assured. A letter to Taylor from John Evelyn, dated 9 February 1655, appears to refer to some recent restraint or imprisonment that Taylor had undergone in Wales. There is no other evidence of this, and yet some scholars have supposed a connection between this putative imprisonment and possible offence given to the authorities by the outspoken episcopalianism of the preface to <span class="italic">Golden Grove</span>, his devotional manual which appeared in December 1654 (despite a title-page date of 1655). Tradition and over-enthusiastic scholarship may have exaggerated the number of occasions on which Taylor was imprisoned, but the fear and insecurity were all too real.<br>
<br>In March 1655 Taylor was once again in London. He preached at St Gregory by Paul's, where he was heard by Evelyn. He no doubt also took this opportunity to deliver the manuscript of <span class="italic">Unum necessarium</span> to Richard Royston, the Anglican royalist bookseller who printed most of Taylor's works. This title was entered in the Stationers' register on 3 May, and Thomason dated his copy July 1655. At some stage Royston, either on his own initiative or at the behest of the author, sent several of the printed sheets of this work to Duppa. This was a wise precaution because Taylor had denied the doctrine of original sin. Yet when Duppa returned &#145;his exceptions and arguments with some severity&#146; and Bishop John Warner of Rochester wrote in protest, Taylor simply included their complaints and his reply in the preface. He<blockquote>thereby tells everybody of it, before they read so farr into the booke, &amp; by that meanes, it is universally spoken of, and by every single person that I heare of, disliked, and by the B[isho]ps disclaimd. I wish with you, hee would advise before he runs these hazards[.] But I feare, it will not bee. Poor man is in affliction close at Chepstow Castle. (Hammond? to Sheldon?, 14 September [1655], BL, Harley MS 6942, fol. 124)</blockquote>The unrepentant Taylor was confined in Chepstow Castle between May and October 1655, possibly as a consequence of the crackdown prompted by the royalist rising in Wiltshire in March 1655. His gaolers were, however, &#145;civil to my person&#146; and allowed him unimpeded correspondence and the facilities to write  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 9.365). Taylor was free and back in Carmarthenshire by November, but he was now living at Mandinam, near Llangadog, on the estate of his second wife, Joanna Bridges. The date of their marriage is unknown. Mandinam was close to Golden Grove, but Taylor may no longer have been officiating there in view of the recent ordinance prohibiting the employment of Anglican clergymen as domestic chaplains.<h2>
<a name="Controversy"></a>Controversy</h2>In the winter of 1655&#150;6 Taylor was busy defending his position on original sin both in private letters and in works intended for the press. <span class="italic">A Further Explication of the Doctrine of Original Sin</span> was published in November 1655 and was subsequently incorporated in later editions of <span class="italic">Unum necessarium</span> as chapter 7. He visited London in the following spring: on 12 April he dined with Evelyn at Sayes Court in the company of Robert Boyle, John Wilkins, and George Berkeley; and in May Evelyn visited Taylor in London and successfully sought his help in gaining episcopal ordination for Jacques Le Franc, minister of the Walloon church in Norwich. In July Taylor was back in Wales, but keen to settle in London; he was also looking forward to the imminent publication of <span class="italic">Deus justificatus</span> and his <span class="italic">Answer to a Letter</span>, both further defences of his teaching on original sin. It is sometimes suggested that Taylor was imprisoned in Wales in the winter of 1656&#150;7, but this claim seems to rest on a letter to Evelyn dated 21 November 1656. Internal evidence indicates that this letter has been misdated and was sent in November 1655. Certainly the winter of 1656&#150;7 was not kind to Taylor. In February 1657 he wrote to Evelyn of the death from smallpox of two of his sons:<blockquote>I have now but one son left, whom I intend (if it please God) to bring up to London before Easter; and then I hope to wait upon you, and by your sweet conversation and other divertissements, if not to alleviate my sorrows, yet, at least, to entertain myself and keep me from too much intense and actual thinkings of my troubles. (<span class="italic">Diary and Correspondence</span>, 578)</blockquote>That summer Taylor seems to have finally moved to London: he was to be found baptizing Evelyn's newborn child in June, preaching the funeral sermon for Sir George Dalston, a pious supporter of the church, in September, and frequently preaching in one or more private houses to a circle of pious Anglicans. He was befriended by Lord and Lady Conway and visited them at Kensington and Ragley in Worcestershire. He collected his controversial works, going back to his 1642 defence of episcopacy and including some of his works on original sin, in one folio volume, <span class="italic">Simbolon ethiko-polemikon, or, A Collection of Polemic and Moral Discourses</span>, and produced <span class="italic">A Collection of Offices, or Forms of Prayer</span> (appeared December 1657), which was explicitly designed to fill the gap left by the ban on the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. Yet, characteristically, Taylor remained unsettled:<blockquote>I have some thoughts of retiring from noise and company, and going to my studies in a far distant solitude, but not to Wales. This place [London] is expensive of my no money and my little time, concerning both which I am constrained to take some more care. (19 December 1657, BL, Tanner MS 52, fol. 216)</blockquote>The last clause was a reference to his wife's current pregnancy, which was mentioned in Lady Conway's letters and the outcome of which is unclear. Taylor and Joanna Bridges had at least two children: Edward, who was buried at Lisburn, co. Antrim, on 10 March 1661, and Joanna, upon whom her mother's estate was settled in reversion as part of her marriage settlement of 1668 with Edward Harrison (1644&#150;1700) of Magheralin, MP for Lisburn.<br>
<br>In London during the winter of 1657&#150;8 Taylor continued to preach, to write, and to offer spiritual guidance and moral support to a mainly Anglican group. A story that he was imprisoned in the Tower of London seems based on a misreading of a letter from Evelyn to the lieutenant of the Tower: Evelyn alludes to suspicions of Taylor as popishly affected and suggests a meeting, and this in turn suggests that the letter may properly belong to January 1658 rather than its apparent date of 1657. If that is the case this allusion may be connected to the council of state's recommendation of 22 December 1657 that Peter Gunning and Taylor be summoned for &#145;an account of the frequent meetings of multitudes of people held with them&#146; and that the ban on the prayer book be enforced  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1657&#150;8</i>, 226). One fruit of this was the raids on various congregations using the prayer book on Christmas day 1657, but there is nothing to confirm that Taylor was caught up in these events  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Evelyn</span>, 3.203&#150;5).<br>
<br>Taylor's desire to retire from London was noted by his friends. In May 1658 he refused Conway's offer of a lectureship at Lisburn (Lisnagarvey), co. Antrim, in which he would have alternated with another lecturer and been dependent on the whim of the subscribers and the local ecclesiastical authorities. Moreover the stipend was insufficient to cover even the costs and trouble of moving his family to Ulster. Nor were the authorities any keener to let him go to Ulster. On 10 June the council of state had refused a pass for Taylor to travel to Ireland. Edward Conway was not to be thwarted, however. He dragooned his friends to cajole Taylor with offers of land in Ireland and help from local patrons, and he even got a pass for Taylor and his family from Lord Protector Cromwell himself. So later that summer Taylor and his family arrived in Ireland.<h2>
<a name="Ireland"></a>Ireland</h2>Taylor was based on Conway's estate at Portmore, in the parish of Ballinderry, 8 miles from Lisburn. The religious situation in Antrim, as in the whole of Ireland, was complex. The majority of the population was Roman Catholic, while the protestant governing &eacute;lite was divided. The episcopalian Church of Ireland had suffered like the Church of England, yet it had maintained an identity and a presence. The aged Bishop Leslie of Down and Connor had not lost contact with his diocese. He had been sheltered in Arthur Hill's house at Hillsborough, where &#145;the publick liturgy of the church is greatly valued, and diligently us'd&#146;  (Barnard, 151). The presbyterians who had occupied many of the livings of the Irish church were a strong group, closely linked to the Scottish presbyterians but also royalist. The Cromwellian army of occupation had brought religious radicals, Baptists and Independents, to political dominance in Ireland in the early 1650s. However, since the arrival of Henry Cromwell in 1655 there had been a steady transfer of local power back to the protestant landed class and a weakening of religious radicalism. Presumably the arrival of Taylor was intended to bolster this process in the corner of Antrim where Conway had his large estates. Despite the displeasure of the local presbyterians at his presence, Taylor quickly set to work. He preached; he served as chaplain in the Conway household and that of Conway's brother-in-law, George Rawdon, commander of the Lisburn garrison; and tradition has it that he officiated in the ruined church of Ballinderry in the marshes west of Lough Beg. He was involved in the uniting of parishes and in the building of a new parish church. And in his study he polished the final chapters of <span class="italic">Ductor dubitantium</span>.<br>
<br>A minor irritation arose in June 1659 when Philip Tandy, a local Independent preacher, complained to Henry Cromwell that Taylor had baptized a child with the sign of the cross. There may have been an element of pique in this: Lord Conway had heard that the quarrel was because Tandy &#145;thinks Dr Taylor more welcome to Hillsborough than himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.cccxxxviii). Tandy's complaint was overtaken by events. The following month Henry Cromwell lost power and left office; following the collapse of the protectorate, radical republican elements assumed authority. On 11 August it was ordered that Taylor be brought to Dublin to answer charges, but nothing was done: on 3 November Taylor confessed himself baffled by events. Then, in December, he was summoned to Dublin only to find, after a painful journey, that the radical regime had fallen apart. He was soon back in his study at Portmore watching events unfold and waiting for the end of winter and a safe passage to England.<br>
<br>April 1660 was an opportune moment to arrive in London: Taylor signed a &#145;loyal&#146; or royalist address to General Monk on 24 April; and he dedicated his <span class="italic">Ductor dubitantium</span>, which appeared in June, to Charles II. On 6 August Taylor was nominated as bishop of Down and Connor. His preferment in Ireland is explicable in several ways. He was a well-known and respected devotional and controversial writer, and an undisputed &#145;sufferer&#146; for the Anglican and royalist cause, but he was also an uncompromising episcopalian and heterodox in his teaching on original sin: in short, Taylor was not the kind of churchman to suit the inclusive English church under consideration in 1660. In Ireland, however, with John Bramhall designated for the primacy and the duke of Ormond a powerful ally at court, the strident Taylor was a natural choice.<br>
<br>In Ireland a power struggle was in full swing. After nominating the Irish bishops, Charles II had not rushed to have them consecrated or translated to their new posts for fear that the sight of zealous Irish prelates acting against local presbyterians would damage the delicate English negotiations. Taylor, still only a nominee, was wise to tread carefully in Down. In the course of 1660 many presbyterian clergy had regained the livings that they had lost to Independents in the Cromwellian years. In December Taylor heard that the presbyterian ministers &#145;have lately bought my books, and appointed a committee of Scotch spiders to see if they can gather or make poison out of them&#146; and that they were now planning to charge him before the Irish privy council as an Arminian, Socinian, and &#145;a heretic in grain&#146; (Seymour, 196&#150;7; <span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1660&#150;62</i>, 115). They had refused his invitations to confer, saying they would &#145;speak with no bishop&#146;. For his part, he told Ormond, he would prefer to be a village curate &#145;than a bishop over such intolerable persons&#146;  (<span class="italic">Holy Living</span>, xxxi). But Taylor was not one to shrink from a fight. He wrote to Lord Conway in January 1661 from Dublin, hoping that his business would be done speedily so &#145;that I may go into the North and take care of my friends and my enemies&#146;  (Stranks, 225). The consecration of Taylor and eleven other prelates took place on 27 January 1661 in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. Taylor himself preached the sermon and did not mince his words: &#145;without bishops there can be no priests, and consequently no sacraments&#146; and no church; the presbyterians were simply schismatic  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 6.349). In Rawdon's view he &#145;taught them the office of a Bishop&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1660&#150;62</i>, 199). He had now been sworn in as vice-chancellor of Trinity College, Dublin, an institution which he proceeded to reform energetically. In February he gained his wish to become a member of the Irish privy council. Disappointed of his hopes for the bishopric of Meath, he was given the additional responsibility of administering the diocese of Dromore. On 8 May he preached at the opening of the Irish parliament and was vitriolic about the &#145;criminally disobedient&#146; dissenters. He castigated the presbyterians for not conforming to the protestant episcopal church and denounced the notion of liberty for tender consciences. A few days later parliament issued a declaration that all subjects conform to episcopal church government and the liturgy as established by law.<br>
<br>Steps were now taken to bring the presbyterian clergy to heel. Bishop Taylor was undeniably belligerent. His visitation at Lisburn was probably held in March or April 1661, in other words before parliament's declaration, but this made no difference to his attitude or that of the presbyterians. Only two presbyterian ministers attended, and Taylor immediately declared thirty-six livings vacant. One hostile witness claimed that he did so because their ministers did not have episcopal ordination. No doubt Taylor did not believe them properly ordained (although there was no explicit legal requirement for episcopal ordination in Ireland until 1667), but more obviously he would not brook opposition to his own authority as bishop.<br>
<br>Taylor was now &#145;full of public concerns and the troubles of business in my diocese&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary and Correspondence</span>, 599, Dublin, 16 November 1661). His duties took him to Dublin often: he preached there on 4 May and 10 August 1662, and on 15 February and 16 July 1663. In the summer of 1663 he planned &#145;to visit the churches in Antrim up as farre as Colerane and so about to Glenarme and Caricfergus; to put all perfectly right&#146;  (Gathorne-Hardy and Williams, 110&#150;11). In 1662&#150;3 he investigated local ghost sightings, and this information eventually found its way into Joseph Glanvill's <span class="italic">Saducismus triumphatus</span> (1682). In 1664 Taylor published a <span class="italic">Dissuasive from Popery</span>, which linked what he considered to be false Catholic doctrines such as purgatory and transubstantiation to the credulity and folk beliefs of the Irish-speaking natives, and revealed his own increasing pessimism about the success of the Church of Ireland. Taylor's was a strenuous and troubled episcopate, and he dreamed of a return to England, if only for the winter; &#145;and I hear is preparing court sermons already&#146; reported Rawdon in 1665  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1663&#150;5</i>, 551). Although his health was indifferent, he was still working hard as bishop and controversialist: in July 1665 he &#145;is so close at his study replying to [the] answers to his book against Popery that he is hardly got out of his closet&#146;  (ibid., 603). In 1660&#150;61 he had lived at Hillsborough and then Portmore, but after 1664 he lived mainly in Castle Street, Lisburn, although he owned other houses and a farm at Megharalin. It was at Castle Street, Lisburn, after suffering ten days of fever, apparently contracted while visiting the sick, that Taylor died at about 3 p.m. on 13 August 1667. According to George Rawdon, who was present, Taylor had to be reminded to write his will, and contrary to expectations he left little save &pound;1500 in the hands of the earl of Donegal and &pound;600 held by Lord Conway  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1666&#150;9</i>, 425, 429). It was Taylor's wish to be buried either in the church he had built at Dromore or at Ballinderry if that church was consecrated before his death. He was buried in a vault in the chancel of the cathedral church at Dromore.<h2>
<a name="Writings"></a>Writings</h2>Taylor's difficult years in Ireland and his early death around the age of fifty-four cannot overshadow his literary achievements, which are all the more impressive in view of the hand-to-mouth existence he was leading for much of the 1640s and 1650s. His published writings were the basis of his fame during his lifetime and since. Although many of his works defy easy classification, there are three areas in which he made his mark.<br>
<br>Taylor enjoys a reputation as a proponent of religious toleration. This is entirely due to his early work <span class="italic">The Liberty of Prophesying</span>, which is an extended essay, in a plainer prose than he later used, on the need for religious liberty. This liberty was defined as freedom from persecution and the freedom to profess and teach all religions so long as they did not promote impiety or disturb the public peace. Taylor was prepared to include Anabaptists and Roman Catholics within such a liberty. Although the influence of William Chillingworth and John Hales is discernible, Taylor was undoubtedly far in advance of most protestant thought on the subject, and yet there is an apparent absence of rigour in his position. His central tenet was that there is no more certain and universal rule of faith than the apostles' creed, and so this must become the measure of Christian unity of faith; he proposed that it should serve as the basis of church communion, with all other theological, liturgical, and ecclesiological teachings dismissed as non-fundamentals. Taylor assumed that all individuals had to judge for themselves, and that the honest error of an innocent person would incur no punishment:<blockquote>it concerns all persons to see that they do the best to find out the truth; and if they do, it is certain that, let the error be ever so damnable, they shall escape the error, or the misery of being damned for it. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 8.231)</blockquote>Beyond this, the tract is merely an exhortation to prudence, charity, and humility and a denunciation of pride, violence, and schism, all made, of course, at least in part on behalf of a proscribed and persecuted Anglican church. Even during his own lifetime, this tract began to haunt him. Taylor added more than twenty-three folio pages to the 1657 edition to show why Anabaptism was an error. It hardly needs to be said that his own episcopate demonstrated scant tolerance of those who disagreed with the episcopalian church.<br>
<br>The achievement of which Taylor was most proud was his contribution to the creation of an English casuistry. <span class="italic">Ductor dubitantium, or, The Rule of Conscience</span> (1660) was designed as a comprehensive manual of cases of conscience which would form a capstone to the English protestant edifice already created by Robert Sanderson, Joseph Hall, and William Perkins. No longer would English clergy need to consult Roman Catholic casuists and run the risk of being misled by their &#145;probabilism&#146; (the teaching that a course of action was allowed if <i>some</i>, rather than a majority of, moral theologians permitted it). Taylor promised general rules from which every particular case could be resolved. Unfortunately, in the opinion of many readers, his huge work lost sight of this goal and became lost in its own digressions: K. E. Kirk described it as &#145;erudite, tortuous and garrulous&#146;  (Kirk, 205); Cardinal Newman marvelled &#145;how weak a thread of thoughts&#146; connected the book's quotations and references  (Miller, 132&#150;3). In common with his fellow protestant casuists, Taylor inclined towards &#145;probabiliorism&#146; and was often severe in his conclusions; for example, he denied the distinction of mortal and venial sins. In effect, Taylor believed that there is always a right answer in moral dilemmas, even if human reason cannot fathom it; and while offering the conventional teaching on the obligation of an &#145;erroneous conscience&#146;, he placed an overwhelming emphasis on the duty of human reason to discern the good act where &#145;good&#146; is defined by rational nature and divine commands.<br>
<br>Among his contemporaries Taylor's devotional works were far more popular than his 1100-page casuistical tome. His devotional writings ranged from liturgical collections to sermons, from arguably the first English life of Christ, <span class="italic">The Great Exemplar</span>, a mixture of narrative and prayer, to two great manuals of practical piety, <span class="italic">Holy Living</span> and <span class="italic">Holy Dying</span>. The popularity of Taylor's writings in this vein was overwhelming: they were among the best and steadiest sellers of the century; <span class="italic">Holy Living</span> and <span class="italic">Holy Dying</span> had both reached their nineteenth edition by 1695. These pious books were treasured by devout Anglicans like John Evelyn, who used Taylor's meditations and prayers as inspirations for his own private devotions. In a letter of 1654 Dorothy Osborne described herself as a devotee of Taylor's works and paraphrased <span class="italic">Holy Living</span> on the duty of submission. Clandestine Anglican congregations may have used his various liturgical works in place of the prohibited prayer book.<h2>
<a name="Significance"></a>Significance</h2>Taylor's success owes as much to his literary talent as his intellect. He was notable for his eloquence, his almost poetical imagination, and his wide biblical and classical learning: even his opponents recognized his &#145;admirable wit, great parts, quick and elegant pen, his abilities in critical learning, and his profound skill in antiquities&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.784). His sonorous prose has been criticized as over-elaborate; some have suggested that Taylor exemplifies an ornate and copious prose style, occasionally described as Ciceronian, which depends upon extended similes and self-conscious flights of fancy to achieve its powerful emotional effects. He certainly builds up long sentences of linked clauses, often using figurative language and embellished with classical and biblical parallels, but rarely does so without a clear rhetorical purpose in mind. And when necessary, brevity is employed.<br>
<br>Taylor was not a systematic, nor even a particularly consistent, thinker or theologian; the confusion of his sacramental doctrine, for instance, has often been noted by commentators. Taylor's churchmanship, as is to be expected in a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the Laudians, included a preference for such things as private confession to the priest, confirmation, vestments, and ritual, and a single-minded devotion to the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. In theology he was uncompromisingly Arminian: he described the works of the Arminian systematizer Episcopius as &#145;excellent&#146; and containing &#145;the whole body of orthodox religion&#146;; Hugo Grotius was also among his influences. Taylor's assertion of episcopacy in 1642 took a Cyprianic line on the necessity of bishops to the being of a church, and he may have been the first to deny categorically the validity of the clerical orders of the European Reformed churches. He was a central figure in what is sometimes called the &#145;holy living&#146; school of mid-seventeenth-century Anglicanism. This severe outlook required a rigorous commitment from the individual Christian. In Taylor's writings, repentance was a once-and-for-all event. So convinced was he of this that he took his view to its logical, and controversial, conclusions: in <span class="italic">Holy Living</span> and elsewhere, Taylor dismissed deathbed repentance as utterly inadequate and ineffective. When preparing his manual on repentance, <span class="italic">Unum necessarium</span>, he &#145;found the usual doctrines of original sin to be one&#146; of the &#145;principles of evil life&#146;, and so without compunction he repudiated the doctrine  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 52, fol. 101). In chapter 6 of <span class="italic">Unum necessarium</span>, he argued from <span class="roman">Romans</span> 5 that Adam's sin was imputed to humankind: &#145;the effect of one sin, and the cause of many; a stain, but no sin&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 9.94). In other words, human beings do not inherit original sin, so sin can neither destroy our liberty nor make us sin of necessity. For Taylor, God does not damn anyone solely on the grounds of an inherited sin, but for the actual sin they voluntarily commit. Taylor was adamant that humans enjoyed free will, and would not retract his teaching on original sin even in the face of a barrage of criticism from fellow Anglicans such as Sheldon, Sanderson, and Duppa, and from puritans such as Henry Jeanes, John Gaule, and Nathaniel Stephens. He consoled himself that his teaching was on &#145;that side where God's justice and goodness stand apparently&#146;; the &#145;precepts of holiness might as well be preached to a wolf as to a man, if men were naturally and inevitably wicked&#146; (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 52, fol. 101; <span class="italic">Works</span>, 9.46). In all this, Taylor stood so far outside the Augustinian assumptions of the majority of English protestant theologians that he was widely perceived as &#145;semi-Pelagian&#146;. Modern readers, however, may find Taylor's work remarkable for its emotional power, acute sense of human capabilities and responsibilities, and emphasis on the practical duties of a Christian profession.<br>
<br>Taylor was stubborn and surprisingly pugnacious for one so famed for his piety. Those who knew him remarked on his polemical tendencies. &#145;I am glad he left no more trouble behind him&#146;, remarked Archbishop Sheldon on news of his death. &#145;He was of a dangerous temper apt to break out into extravagancies, and I have had, till of late years, much to do with him to keep him in order, and to find diversions for him&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 45, fol. 222). In 1664, when asking for translation to an English see, Taylor told Sheldon that he had heard on good authority &#145;that your grace was pleased once to say, that I myself was the only hindrance to myself of being removed to an English bishopric&#146;. It was obtuse of Taylor not to appreciate what Sheldon really meant and tactless (or brazen) to repeat it to him. Others, however, saw Taylor as a saintly figure: for John Evelyn he was a spiritual guide, his &#145;ghostly father&#146;. Taylor's circle of friends was diverse, including Henry More and Herbert of Cherbury, and several notable women, such as the poet Katherine Philips, Lady Conway, and the countess of Carbery. Above all it was his literary legacy, admired by Wesley, Coleridge, Lamb, Arnold, Heber, and Gosse, that was most significant. For once, even the acerbic Anthony Wood has only praise to offer: Taylor's writings &#145;will be famous to all succeeding generations for the exactness of wit, profoundness of judgement, richness of fancy, clearness of expression, copiousness of invention, and general usefulness to all the purposes of a Christian&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.783).<br>
