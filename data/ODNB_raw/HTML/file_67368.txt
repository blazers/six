<span class="headword">Brown, Dame  Beryl  Paston</span>  (1909&#150;1997), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born at 78 Ribblesdale Road, Streatham, London, on 7 March 1909, the only daughter and elder child of Paston Charles Brown, bank clerk, and his wife, Florence May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Henson. Her father claimed descent from the Pastons of the Paston letters. Her mother was related to Herbert Hensley Henson, bishop of Durham. Beryl was a pupil at Streatham Hill high school and felt privileged all her life to have had a suburban childhood with access to art galleries, concerts, and, most important, the Old Vic. She became a scholar of Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1929, and was awarded firsts in both parts of the English tripos. She then trained as a teacher at the London Day Training College (later the London Institute of Education).<br>
<br>Paston Brown's first teaching appointment, in 1933, was at Portsmouth Training College, where she divided her time between teaching students and teaching in schools. In 1937 she became a member of the English department of Goldsmiths' College, London, and remained there until 1952 with a two-year interval (1944&#150;6) as a temporary assistant lecturer in her old college, Newnham. After Goldsmiths' she became principal of the Leicester City Training College. Her last appointment was in 1961 when she was offered the post of principal of Homerton College, Cambridge, where she remained until her retirement in 1971.<br>
<br>Homerton had already a well-established academic tradition, and under Paston Brown's leadership developed this further, first with the new three-year course and then with the introduction of the four-year BEd course. Cambridge University was at first reluctant to recognize this development, and Homerton's first degree students secured their BEds from the University of London. By 1971, however, with patient diplomacy and the help of friends in the university, particularly from Newnham, the foundations of a Cambridge degree in education had been laid. Alongside all this Paston Brown's policy of consultation, delegation, and open communication transformed Homerton's fairly authoritarian culture (common among many training colleges) into one of collegiality among both staff and students. She created a representative and effective academic board in the college several years before this became a required element in all college constitutions, and students were encouraged to create a college culture comparable with that in other Cambridge colleges.<br>
<br>Paston Brown was also a significant figure in the Association of Teachers in Colleges and Departments of Education (ATCDE). She was a lively editor (1948&#150;54) of its journal, <span class="italic">Education for Teaching</span>, transforming it from an in-house journal into one of wider interest concerned with issues of educational policy and research. She was chairman of the principals' panel in 1960&#150;61, and was an influential voice in preparing the association's evidence to the Robbins committee on higher education. She was later appointed a member of the Newsom committee whose report, <span class="italic">Half our Future</span>, was published in 1963. This dealt with the education of secondary-school youngsters of average and below average ability, and echoed the ATCDE policy on the value of the concurrent course for the training of teachers in this field. Beryl herself was a strong advocate of this concept of combining in the one course academic study, professional skills, and school experience, particularly for primary school teachers and some areas of secondary teaching. She was elected chairman of the association for 1965&#150;6 and in the following year became a dame of the British empire, the first from the world of teacher training colleges to be so honoured.<br>
<br>In 1971 Paston Brown retired with her Siamese cat to a small eighteenth-century house in Keere Street, Lewes, Sussex, and until her last illness greatly enjoyed her life there. She made many new friends and entered fully into the life of the community, particularly its musical and literary life, enlivened as it was by the new and neighbouring University of Sussex. She did work for Age Concern and became an enthusiastic tutor for the Open University. She was awarded an honorary degree by the Open University in 1978; this gave her great pleasure, especially as she found herself sitting next to Sir John Gielgud (a lifetime's hero) at lunch. She was an attractive, scholarly woman. Children loved her and she had great concern for them. She was a good listener, and old students and former colleagues, from the Portsmouth days and onwards, kept in touch and clearly regarded her with gratitude and affection. She died at her home, 21 Keere Street, Lewes, following a series of strokes, on 25 July 1997, and was cremated at Brighton crematorium on 5 August. She never married. Her younger brother died on active service with the RAF during the Second World War, and following the death of her father in the 1950s she was the only surviving member of her family.<br>
