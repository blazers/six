<span class="headword">Percy,  Thomas</span>, seventh earl of Northumberland  (1528&#150;1572), <span class="occ">magnate and rebel</span>, was born on 10 June 1528, the elder son of Sir Thomas Percy (<i>b</i>. after 1502, <i>d</i>. 1537), rebel, and his wife, Eleanor 
    (or Alianore; <i>b</i>. in or before 1513, <i>d</i>. 1567)
  , daughter of Guiscard Harbottal of Beamish, co. Durham. His younger brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21938/', "Henry Percy, eighth earl of Northumberland (c.1532&#150;1585)")</script>, magnate, and Guiscard Percy, who died in infancy. He had three sisters, Joan (<i>d</i>. 1572), Mary (<i>d</i>. 1598), and Katherine. Sir Thomas and his brother Ingram Percy were disaffected when they were disinherited by their childless elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21937/', "Henry Algernon Percy, sixth earl of Northumberland (c.1502&#150;1537)")</script>, magnate, who began alienating land to the crown and others some years before his death. Sir Thomas Percy headed 10,000 Richmondshire and North Riding men during the Pilgrimage of Grace from October 1536. Early the following year his name was invoked to try to start new revolts in the North and West Ridings of Yorkshire. As a result, he was executed at Tyburn on 2 June 1537. Ingram Percy apparently died naturally about the same time, probably in prison.<h2>
<a name="ThePercyrestoration15491558"></a>The Percy restoration, 1549&#150;1558</h2>The pilgrimage's suppressor, Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk, sent Thomas and Sir Thomas Percy's other sons to stay with a member of Henry VIII's council of the north. Initially, they stayed with their kinsman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/77125/', "Sir Thomas Tempest (c.1500&#150;1545)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71864/', "Tempest family (per. c.1500&#150;1657)")</script>], at Holmside, co. Durham, and then at Tong Hall, Yorkshire. They are also said to have spent time at Liverpool, probably after their mother's second marriage in 1541 to Sir Richard Holland (<i>d</i>. 1548) of Denton, Lancashire. Thomas Percy was restored in blood by the 1549 parliament. John Dudley, duke of Northumberland, who was acquiring Percy estates in the north from the early 1550s, made a token gesture by giving the two brothers &pound;66 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. per annum from former family property, and later granted Thomas Percy lands worth some &pound;100 per annum around Langley, Northumberland.<br>
<br>The execution of the duke in 1553 freed the Northumberland title and lands, potentially to return to the Percys. However, Mary I showed little haste to do so until unrest in the north made it advisable. In November 1554 Thomas Percy served as knight of the shire for Westmorland. By 1555 he had secured his father's office of constable of Prudhoe Castle, Northumberland. In another centre of family influence, the North Riding, he distinguished himself in the recapture of Scarborough Castle from Thomas Stafford in April 1557. This led immediately to his knighthood and elevation as Baron Percy on 30 April and as earl of Northumberland the next day. He was then appointed high marshal of the army in the north (30 May) and member of the council of the north.<br>
<br>Although the Percy landed base had created &#145;enormous problems of government in the north-east&#146;, it was not in the crown's power to reverse fully the sixth earl of Northumberland's dissipation of it  (Hoyle, 36). The Cliffords and Thomas Wharton, first Baron Wharton, for example, naturally hung on to the north-western lands he had given them. The seventh earl of Northumberland was restored to a landed revenue of &pound;3077 per annum&#151;only about three-quarters of his grandfather's patrimony, without considering inflation&#151;and that derived from depreciated capital resources. The Percys' Northumberland seat of Alnwick&#151;and presumably also more distant estates&#151;had been substantially stripped since 1537. The stewardship of the royal honour of Richmond was, however, a valuable resource to the new earl.<br>
<br>The restoration was made in reward for Thomas Percy's action at Scarborough, but also in hope of useful activity on the Scottish border. Old Percy connections had been disinclined to assist Wharton, who was regarded as a newcomer who had unduly profited from the family's fall and was rewarded with appointment as warden of the middle and east marches as a result. Northumberland took these offices over on August 1557. The privy council expressed to Francis Talbot, fourth earl of Shrewsbury, the hope that thus &#145;the untowardnes of the Northumberlande men &hellip; will be partely reformed&#146;  (G. W. Bernard, <span class="italic">The Power of the Early Tudor Nobility</span>, 1985, 117). Northumberland and his brother Sir Henry Percy defended the border in 1557&#150;8 with some success, assisted by the growing dissension between the Scots and the French. Shrewsbury complained, however, of Northumberland's alarmist reports and premature demands for expensive support.<br>
<br>Northumberland married on 12 June 1558 Anne (1536&#150;1591) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/107539/', "Percy, Anne, countess of Northumberland")</script>], third daughter of Henry Somerset, second earl of Worcester, and his second wife, Elizabeth. Their only son, Thomas Percy, died in 1560. Their daughters were Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1559, <i>d</i>. in or after 1604), Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1560, <i>d</i>. before 1564/5?), Lucy (<i>b</i>. before 1564/5, <i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1601), Jane (<i>b</i>. after 1564/5?, <i>d</i>. after 1591), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66980/', "Mary Percy")</script>, who became abbess of the Convent of the Assumption of Our Blessed Lady, Brussels.<h2>
<a name="Elizabethaneclipse15581569"></a>Elizabethan eclipse, 1558&#150;1569</h2>Northumberland was told he could not be spared from the north to attend Elizabeth I's first parliament, and his proxy, Henry Fitzalan, twelfth earl of Arundel, proved inactive as a champion of Roman Catholicism. He was confirmed as warden of the east march on 18 January 1559. Officially in charge of Anglo-Scottish peace negotiations at Norham in February 1559, Northumberland delegated largely to his protestant brother Percy, who was quietly conferring with Scottish protestants on behalf of Sir William Cecil. Sir Ralph Sadler, on an inspection tour of the border in the autumn, recommended replacing both Percys, though Northumberland, as a &#145;rank papist&#146; was the worse. An overheated dispute erupted when Northumberland tried to insist that his brother-in-law Slingsby, as keeper of Tynedale, be accommodated in Hexham Abbey by Lady Carnaby (probably the widow of Sir Reynold Carnaby, a counsellor of the sixth earl of Northumberland allegedly behind his disinheritance of his brothers). Northumberland would not &#145;beare the contempte and despite offred unto me&#146;; but he, according to Sadler, wrote &#145;lettres &hellip; the lyke wherof I have not sene wrytten in such a case by any subject&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers and Letters</span>, 1.426, 443). The outcome was the resignation first of Slingsby and, by the end of the year, of Northumberland. He managed to keep his successor, his wife's uncle, William Grey, thirteenth Baron Grey of Wilton, new warden of the east march, from using Alnwick Castle as his base. The earl's plea that it was unfurnished is confirmed elsewhere, but Grey of Wilton continued to complain of Northumberland's underhand influence and punished some of his men, such as George Clarkson, his deputy steward.<br>
<br>Despite Sadler's opinion of his religion, Northumberland's local influence had been recognized by making him a member of Elizabeth's ecclesiastical visitation for the northern province. Presumably he did nothing to enhance its efficiency in imposing a protestant settlement, but he had not as yet become an ostentatious recusant. Once free to go to parliament, he did take the opportunity to oppose new measures and attended some 60 per cent of sessions in 1563 and 75 per cent in 1566, acting as the queen's sword-bearer for the 1563 closure and the 1566 opening. However, he was habitually passed over for committees, except ones of inescapable local relevance or needing a muster of major peers (such as the 1566 succession delegations). In 1563 he was said to have warned against punitive enforcement of the oath of supremacy&#151;&#145;when they had beheaded the clergy they would claim to do the same to the lay nobles&#146;&#151;and in 1566 he was one of eleven opposing confirmation of episcopal consecrations  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1558&#150;67</i>, 293).<br>
<br>Elizabeth's government made some minimal gestures of inclusion towards such a major peer, notably nomination to the Order of the Garter on 22 April and installation on 23 May 1563, but Northumberland's disconnection from the court was clear. The 1562 project for Mary, queen of Scots to meet Elizabeth was bound to involve Northumberland as an escort to Newcastle. He obtained assurances that he would not be expected to receive her at Alnwick, stressing his &#145;unabilitie &hellip; much the worse for the service I was lately in, in the northe partes, which as yet is far unrecovered&#146;  (Sharp, 337). He was removed from the quorum of the peace in Northumberland and the commissions of the peace in Yorkshire in 1564 in a purge of known Catholics.<br>
<br>Northumberland had some contact in Yorkshire with Margaret Stewart, countess of Lennox, and was regarded as a key player in her rather overblown reputation for political intrigue. Allegedly he was required at court at Christmas 1561 to keep him away from her: there was a project to marry one of his sisters to the Yorkist claimant Arthur Pole. At the height of English opposition to the marriage in 1565 of Margaret's son Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, to Mary, queen of Scots, the latter's half-brother, James Stewart, earl of Moray, convinced Sir Nicholas Throckmorton in Edinburgh that Northumberland was part of a Lennox plot and should again be kept in London.<br>
<br>Northumberland's power in the north may have been regarded as a potential threat by the privy council, but he perhaps failed to cultivate and entrench his local power sufficiently during the 1560s. At best, he based himself at Topcliffe in the North Riding or Leconfield in the East Riding and neglected to exercise effective lordship in Northumberland. He never proceeded with his aim of &#145;continually lying&#146; at Alnwick Castle  (Batho, &#145;Percies and Alnwick&#146;, 50). Clarkson complained that the baronial court had also largely collapsed, leaving &#145;the lorde himselfe in his owne countrie not regarded&#146; and &#145;tenants &hellip; not so much in feare of his lordshipe &hellip; as of other gentlemen ther neighbours&#146;  (James, <span class="italic">Society</span>, 296&#150;7). If they wanted a Percy, Sir Henry Percy was close by to divert loyalties from the earl, much as their father and Ingram Percy had from the sixth earl of Northumberland, while Sir John Forster, leading the other gentlemen who had done well out of the Percy forfeiture, had established himself at Alnwick Abbey and had largely taken over even in the Percy heartland.<br>
<br>The government later presented Northumberland as a spendthrift, this being an aspect of his moral degeneration&#151;at all events, financial problems were never far away. He was baulked by the crown in his most innovative attempted solution. Admittedly the initiative in starting to mine copper as well as coal on his estate at Newlands, Cumberland, came from crown patentees, but he thought he saw an opportunity to claim at least a share. By 1568 Northumberland's hopes &#145;to make more yearlye of the mynes of Newland then of all his inherytance&#146; were dashed  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/42/39). The exchequer ruled that traces of precious metal in copper made the latter crown property&#151;a new precedent and, to landowners, a sinister one. By October 1568 Northumberland was sufficiently disgruntled to seek a licence to travel abroad, as he told Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, still insisting that &#145;most of the best learned&#146; favoured his case  (<span class="italic">Pepys MSS</span>, 135).<br>
<br>When Francis Yaxley was shipwrecked off Northumberland in 1565 with money from Pius IV for Mary, queen of Scots, Northumberland annexed the salvage. Reportedly, though the queen got a share, the earl still acquired over &pound;2000. Supposedly &#145;the seventh earl had no particular reason to make a grievance of his treatment by the law&#146;, but the defeat over mining copper probably rankled  (James, <span class="italic">Society</span>, 302). The incident also showed that Northumberland was more interested in profit than in conciliating the pope or the queen of Scotland. The idea that he gave asylum to the latter's opponents, such as James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton, and that they subsequently betrayed him to Elizabeth is, however, over-artistic&#151;their reception was a matter for the royal officers on the border.<br>
<br>Hereditary instinct made it difficult to favour Mary while queen of Scotland, but as a Catholic heir within England it was rather different. She landed in May 1568 at Workington, within Northumberland's liberty of Cockermouth. He obtained an order from the council of the north to take charge of her, which they later claimed presupposed he would be first on the scene. However, Sir Richard Lowther had already taken Mary to Carlisle and was unmoved by the earl, telling him he was &#145;too meane a man to have such charge&#146; and a &#145;varlett&#146;  (Sharp, 340). Northumberland pleaded that &#145;my credyt be not so much impared in the face of my contrey, as she shuld be taken from me&#146;, but unsuccessfully  (ibid., 318). Sir Francis Knollys went north on behalf of the privy council to tell him &#145;he had overshott himself verie muche to the discontentation of her highnes&#146;  (ibid., 341). This was the start of Northumberland's interest in alliance with Mary, contradicting his imputed closeness to the Lennox Stewarts, who believed the Scottish queen had murdered Darnley.<br>
<br>Northumberland flirted with various abortive projects to free Mary, one of which was based on his wife visiting and changing clothes with her. Having been called to Whitehall Palace at the end of 1568 for the hearings on charges against Mary (as spectator rather than commissioner), he took the opportunity to confer with the ambassadors of Philip II and Mary, Guerau de Spes and John Leslie, bishop-elect of Ross, on occasion &#145;disguised, at four o'clock in the morning&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1568&#150;79</i>, 96). Surreptitious proceedings did not, however, lead to any effective conclusions. By the time the court conspiracy based around Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk, had reached a crisis, Northumberland was in the north, communication delays leaving him behind events. Norfolk's submission left Northumberland dangerously implicated but &#145;out of all hope, of eyther ayd or mayntenance&#146;  (Sharp, 203).<br>
<br>Northumberland also moved towards a religious justification for resistance to Elizabeth. By 1572 at least he was well acquainted with two of Nicholas Sander's works of Catholic controversy, <span class="italic">The Supper of Our Lord</span> (1566) and <span class="italic">The Rock of the Church</span> (1567). He implied that such reading had cured him of any inclination to religious compromise and that he had been reconciled to the Catholic church about late 1567 or early 1568 by &#145;one Master Copley&#146;, and then started to discuss the legitimacy of rebellion, the general feeling being that it was justifiable only if the prince &#145;were lawfully excommunicated by the hed of the church&#146;  (Sharp, 204). On 8 November 1569 Northumberland and Charles Neville, sixth earl of Westmorland, on the point of rebellion, wrote to Pius V asking him to excommunicate Elizabeth, which elicited the bull <span class="italic">Regnans in excelsis</span> (May 1570).<h2>
<a name="Thenorthernuprising1569"></a>The northern uprising, 1569</h2>Northumberland's own account of how he came to rebel in November 1569 certainly contains self-serving elements, but it is broadly confirmed elsewhere. The prime movers were members of the gentry such as the Norton family&#151;many related to Westmorland to some degree&#151;while the two earls could not even agree on aims between themselves. Westmorland, Norfolk's brother-in-law, supported the project for the duke's marriage to Mary but demurred at a religious justification for revolt. Northumberland had little interest in supporting Norfolk's marriage, preferring that Mary marry a Catholic&#151;though when he suggested &#145;the king, his master&#146; to the Spanish ambassador, the latter merely &#145;wagged his hed&#146;  (Sharp, 190). It was only Westmorland whom Norfolk thought he could dissuade from revolt when he feared &#145;losing of his hed&#146;: Northumberland was to &#145;do what him list&#146;  (ibid., 196).<br>
<br>Relations with Thomas Radcliffe, third earl of Sussex, the lord president of the north, remained cordial enough for the earls to hunt with him during the autumn and to confer gravely about the deplorable nature of all the rumours that they were about to revolt. Sussex's attitude changed in early November, when he advised Elizabeth that formally summoning Northumberland and Westmorland to appear at court would precipitate a crisis. She did so nevertheless, so uncharacteristic a piece of brinkmanship that she cannot have believed him. That the consequent revolt was as unco-ordinated and containable as it proved was not predictable. It was the outcome of desperation. Westmorland claimed on 6 November that he dare not appear for fear of enemies, while Northumberland still temporized at Topcliffe, convenient for York if he had been interested in a mooted project to capture Sussex and the council of the north. On 9 November he withdrew suddenly to Westmorland's castle of Brancepeth, co. Durham, after an alarm that Sir Oswald Wilstrop had come to arrest him, an alarm allegedly contrived by co-conspirators to frighten him into action. He and his wife claimed that the queen had ordered Sussex &#145;to take him and sende him upp moffeled&#146; to court  (Sharp, 22). Elizabeth subsequently affirmed, but regretted, that Sussex had not attempted this  (Haynes, 553). Northumberland's own account naturally stressed his reluctance, that he &#145;could not get away&#146;, and even that &#145;some of the others meant me a displeasure&#146; if he attempted it  (Sharp, 199&#150;200). Thomas Bishop added that Northumberland was threatened with dags.<br>
<br>The escalation and changing dynamic of the rebellion certainly neither betrayed Northumberland's influence nor was calculated to exploit it. Different accounts agree that he had only eight men with him at Brancepeth. His inclination, &#145;being forced to depart my house uppon the soddaine of a false larum [alarm] &hellip; to have repayred to Anwick&#146;, and later to go &#145;into Northumberland and provide my force there&#146; and join Westmorland &#145;about the Water of Tyne&#146; were natural Percy instincts, but his fellows allegedly did not trust him to return  (Sharp, 198&#150;9). He could achieve little in co. Durham, though he was doubtless the prime mover in recruiting the 1241 rebels recorded in Richmondshire, where his opposition as steward of the liberty (from 26 July 1557) to new enclosures for which Elizabeth had reproved him might have stood him in good stead.<br>
<br>Whether thousands would still follow a Percy in Northumberland could not be fully tested because he did little to raise the county. Only eighty to a hundred horse were said to have joined the earl. Efficient recruiting at Westmorland's relatively small Northumberland estates made the Percy effort seem especially deficient. Even his brother-in-law Slingsby, beneficiary of Northumberland's efforts in 1560, preferred to secure his position with an access of loyalism. In Yorkshire, only a minority of Percy tenants turned out, and disproportionately from Topcliffe&#151;hardly any came even from his other principal estate of Leconfield because he did not make a personal appearance. Cash was also wanted, and with only &pound;130, plus &pound;60 from pawning his Garter collar, Northumberland could not provide it. There was also a half-hearted attempt by Northumberland's men to hold Alnwick and Wark castles. Sir John Forster made the most of his own achievement in obtaining their surrender; with these added to the royal strongholds of Berwick and Newcastle, the rebels lost any chance of junction with Mary's partisans in the Scottish east march. Northumberland's rebellion indeed was a testimony to the decay of the Percy position and a desperate counter-measure against it.<br>
<br>If his recruiting successes were mixed, Northumberland was prominent in the restoration of mass at Durham and Ripon. It was alleged that he needed periodic encouragement by his wife lest he submit. Henry Carey, first Baron Hunsdon, wrote that &#145;the gray mare ys the better horse&#146;  (Sharp, 77); Elizabeth supposedly opined that the countess deserved to be burned for treason. None of the rebels, however, adopted a successful strategy. It took a week to move from Durham to the area of York: bypassing the city to the west suggested an incipient strike south to free Mary, but the opportunity for that had long gone. After increasingly aimless movements, the rebels went into Northumberland in the second week of December. This was retreat, not belated Percy enlistment, and on the 16th the earls left their followers to their own devices and fled from Hexham towards the border.<h2>
<a name="Scottishpawn15691572"></a>Scottish pawn, 1569&#150;1572</h2>Leonard Dacre, in a (bootless) attempt to dissociate himself from his former collaborators, turned them away from Naworth in Cumberland. They had to cross the border on 20 December and throw themselves on the mercy of the notorious Armstrongs of Liddesdale. Successive losses of horses and valuables caused Northumberland to leave his wife&#151;pregnant, and probably tired&#151;with &#145;Jock [Armstrong] of the Side&#146; and continue himself to the house of Hector Armstrong of Harlaw in Liddesdale, who was supposed to owe him a favour but helped Martin Elliot capture him on behalf of Moray on Christmas eve. Thomas Kerr of Ferniehurst, however, rescued the countess, who was later accommodated by Alexander Hume, fifth Baron Hume.<br>
<br>Moray's first instinct was to offer his prisoner to Elizabeth in exchange for Mary; later he mentioned delivering him in conjunction with a request for subsidy, mooting the question of sale even if not as baldly as his successors did. The exchange option was also downgraded from Mary to John Leslie, the troublesome bishop-elect of Ross. Moray's committal of Northumberland to William Douglas at Lochleven Castle, when he found the suggestion of extradition unpopular in Scotland, was meant to buy time.<br>
<br>Obtaining Northumberland became a significant plank of Elizabethan policy towards a divided Scotland. Negotiations to restore Mary also presupposed delivering him. However, his wife believed she had as much chance as Elizabeth of buying him from Lochleven with funds from Philip and Pius. By the beginning of 1572 the countess had 7000 escudos (&pound;2000) in hand. Unfortunately all funds had come through Fernando Alv&aacute;rez de Toledo, duke of Alba, governor of the Netherlands, whom she blamed for wasting the previous year&#151;&#145;the duke never gave me a flatt denyall, but with fayre words delayed me from tyme to tyme, and all upon a feare lest the money shuld be cast away&#146;  (Murdin, 188). It is true that he did not want to spend the pope's money on Northumberland. Greater speed might not have helped: the countess's offer of &pound;2000 only brought an invitation to Elizabeth to match it. On 6 June 1572 Northumberland was sold to England, Scottish face scarcely saved by the pretence that the money was reimbursement for the expense of his imprisonment, which he promptly dismissed with complaints of the cheap food provided.<br>
<br>Morton, Douglas's cousin, attracted popular odium for Northumberland's surrender, although in fact he seemed to oppose it. It occurred on the authority of the current regent John Erskine, seventeenth or first earl of Mar, who extracted vague and noncommittal statements that Northumberland would be treated clemently. It was alleged that while still at Berwick, Northumberland was hopeful of obtaining leniency. Hunsdon followed the queen's instructions to encourage Northumberland to co-operate but to avoid making definite commitments in her name. Though finding little dignity in the proceedings, it was primarily for jurisdictional reasons that he insisted Forster take Northumberland to York. Prior attainder for treason made a trial redundant.<br>
<br>The day after Northumberland's old enemy brought him to York, 22 August 1572, the earl was beheaded in the Pavement. His body was buried the same day in the nearby St Crux Church and his head displayed on Micklegate Bar after a period in the Tolbooth on Ousebridge, during which William Tesimond cut off some hairs of the beard as a relic. Sir Thomas Gargrave reported Northumberland's last profession of Catholic faith and refusal to ask the queen's forgiveness: he made a remark variously reported as &#145;symple Tome must dye to sett up crewell Henry [Percy]&#146; or &#145;crewell heresy&#146;  (Sharp, 335). Northumberland's attainder specifically reserved the rights of his brother Sir Henry Percy to allow him to inherit the title.<h2>
<a name="Themartyrandhisfamily"></a>The martyr and his family</h2>Allegedly manipulated in his lifetime by the countess, who had the distinction of being attainted as a separate individual, Northumberland's posthumous reputation was enhanced by her long survival as a senior Catholic exile. From 1571 she was based at Mechelen. By about 1575 she was at Brussels, nearer the Spanish viceregal government, when English pressure induced it to expel her, but only to the adjacent episcopal territory of Li&egrave;ge. By 1577 she was back in (technically) Spanish territory at Luxembourg, encouraging Don John of Austria to intervene and marry Mary. Cecil (now Baron Burghley) and Robert Persons were in unusual agreement in saying that the frustrations of the dowager countess's position led to madness. She died of smallpox at a Namur convent on 8 or 9 September 1591. She had substantial financial support from Philip (though her monthly pension was said to have shrunk from perhaps &pound;50 to &pound;25) and from other Catholic sources, so she had not only maintained a fair household but left enough for her daughter Jane Percy to be advised to hurry from England to collect it  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/240/19).<br>
<br>Northumberland's daughters had been left at Topcliffe during the rising&#151;their uncle Sir Henry Percy found them there &#145;in harde case&#146; in January 1570  (Fonblanque, 2.73). It would seem likely that, after the younger Mary Percy was born at Aberdeen on 11 June 1570, her mother took her overseas. Mary Percy later went to England and was maintained in family property in Blackfriars but returned to the Low Countries after her mother's death, was professed at Brussels in 1600, and became abbess in 1616. Elizabeth and Lucy Percy married into families that showed some evidence of recusancy&#151;their respective spouses were Richard Woodruffe of Woolley, Yorkshire, and Sir Edward Stanley of Eynsham, Oxfordshire. Jane Percy, less predictably, married Lord Henry Seymour, younger son of Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset, and vice-admiral covering the Flemish coast during the Armada campaign.<br>
<br>The dowager countess's friend Nicholas Sander wrote an account of Northumberland's death, published in John Bridgewater's <span class="italic">Concertatio ecclesiae Catholicae</span> (1589). &#145;The good earle&#146; was named specifically as a martyr in Richard Bristow's <span class="italic">A Brief Treatise</span> (1574)  (fol. 73<i>r</i>). William Allen, after initial doubt, affirmed this in <span class="italic">A True, Sincere, and Modest Defense of English Catholics</span> (1584), &#145;for, what former quarrel or cause of his death soever there was &hellip; he was offered his life if he would alter his religion&#146;  (Allen, <span class="italic">Defense</span>, ed. R. M. Kingdon, 1965, 107&#150;8). Such an equivocal figure was not included among the fifty-four martyrs beatified by Leo XIII in 1886. Thomas Percy did in fact appear in Circignano's fresco cycle of martyrs but anonymously, as a nobleman being beheaded. Northumberland was among nine more candidates advanced by the English Catholic bishops and beatified in 1895: his veneration by the Benedictine nuns possibly helped. The grounds were not just his Catholic declaration on the scaffold, but the idea that he was offered a reprieve if he apostatized, which lacks convincing proof. In fact Northumberland performed far better as martyr than as politician or rebel.<br>
