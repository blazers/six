<span class="headword">Bunting,  Basil Cheesman</span>  (1900&#150;1985), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 1 March 1900 at 27 Denton Road, Scotswood upon Tyne, Northumberland, the elder child of Thomas Lowe Bunting (1868&#150;1925), physician and respected amateur scientist, and Annie Cheesman (1875&#150;1968), daughter of a local mining engineer. One of his earliest memories was of the Northumbrian folksongs sung to him by his nursemaid. After early schooling on Tyneside, he was educated at the Quaker schools of Ackworth, Yorkshire, and Leighton Park, Berkshire. His holidays from Ackworth were spent with a schoolfriend in the west Yorkshire village of Briggflatts. At school he absorbed the elements of Quaker pacifism which led to his being imprisoned for conscientious objection at Wormwood Scrubs and subsequently Winchester from June 1918 until early in 1919. On his release from prison he threw himself into London literary and intellectual life, working in publishing, and with the Fabians. Through one literary contact, Nina Hamnett, he came across the latest work of Ezra Pound, <span class="italic">Homage to Sextus Propertius</span>, and this discovery was of crucial importance to his poetic development. From 1920 he studied at the London School of Economics, leaving without qualification in 1922 to work briefly as secretary to the MP Harry Barnes. In this role he visited Scandinavia, but failed to enter Russia.<br>
<br>By 1923 Bunting was in Paris, working for Ford Madox Ford on <span class="italic">Transatlantic Review</span> through the influence of Ezra Pound, who had become a close friend and mentor, and whom he followed to Rapallo in 1924. His earliest poems written at about this time show clearly the influence of modernism. In 1925 his father died and he returned to Newcastle, lecturing at Leamington Adult School in 1926. His first &#145;sonata&#146;, as he called most of his extended poems in acknowledgement of their musical form, was <span class="italic">Villon</span> (1925): admired by Pound, this poem won him some degree of recognition. Apart from drawing upon the work of Fran&ccedil;ois Villon, the poem incorporates material from Bunting's growing experience of prisons, in England and later in Paris for drunken assault (he was extricated by Pound). For the next two years he made a living in journalism for a range of London weeklies, chiefly as music critic for <span class="italic">Outlook</span> and the <span class="italic">Town Crier</span>, before a benefactor, Margaret de Silver, enabled him to move back to Northumberland, living and writing in a shepherd's house in the Simonside Hills during 1928. Memories from this period of his life were recalled directly nearly four decades later in <span class="italic">Briggflatts</span>.<br>
<br>In 1929 Bunting travelled in Germany, before moving south to Rapallo again. He arrived in Rapallo by way of Venice, where he met Marian Gray Culver (1900&#150;1982), daughter of Howard Leander Culver, a businessman from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, whom he married on 9 July 1930. They had two daughters, Bourtai and Roudaba, and a son, Rustam, who died in 1952. The children's names reflected Bunting's growing interest in Persian literature. From 1930 to 1933 he assisted Pound in Rapallo, contributing to the journal <span class="italic">Il Mare</span>, helping with concerts co-ordinated by Pound and Olga Rudge, meeting W. B. Yeats (who was able to recite one of Bunting's poems for him from memory, and recalled their meeting in his correspondence), and other writers including James Joyce and Louis Zukofsky. He also learned to sail, and sailed extensively on the Ligurian coast. His poetry began to be published, in anthologies edited by Pound and Zukofsky, and in a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Redimiculum Matellarum</span> (1930).<br>
<br>A photograph of Bunting taken about 1930 in Rapallo shows a strong, bespectacled profile of a wiry and sailorly man, with a fine goatee beard, apparently content with self and surroundings. He was growing in self-confidence as a poet, dropping the trappings of apprenticeship to reveal a sparse, modernist-classicist voice in which the teachings of Pound and others were moderated by an understanding of a range of older poetries. Though associated with Zukofsky's objectivists and Pound's &#145;Ezuversity&#146; he was increasingly an individual, isolated to a degree which helped to delay his public notice for more than three decades.<br>
<br>In 1933 the Buntings moved to Santa Cruz de Tenerife&#151;for economy, and perhaps to distance themselves from the increasingly strident Pound. Both were poor and unhappy, and Bunting wrote bitterly of his life there. One lasting and important friendship emerged at this time however, with the exiled German artist Karl Drerup: Bunting corresponded with Drerup at intervals for the rest of his life, and Drerup for his part painted one of the few portraits of Bunting. But the Buntings' marriage was over, and in 1937 Marian returned to America with their daughters and (unborn) son. They divorced in 1940. Bunting returned to Britain in 1937, buying a small boat, <i>The Thistle</i>, which he sailed on the south coast. He studied seamanship at Nellist's nautical school in Newcastle (1938), and lectured in Northumberland before the Second World War. In September 1940 he joined the RAF&#151;with some difficulty, as his eyesight was already poor. Like many, his Quaker principles of individual conscience led him to distinguish between the imperialist values of the First World War, in which he was an objector, and the Second World War, which he (and other objectivist poets such as George Oppen) saw as an important principled fight against fascism, in which he wanted to participate.<br>
<br>Bunting's war was an active and rewarding period of his life (retold, partially, in the sonata <span class="italic">The Spoils</span>, 1951). In 1942 he arrived in Tehran as an RAF interpreter (on the strength of his knowledge of classical Persian), where he undertook intelligence work and rose rapidly in rank, finishing the war as squadron leader. In peacetime he worked at the British embassy in Tehran, and subsequently as <span class="italic">The Times</span> correspondent there. He married Sima Alladadian (<i>b</i>. 1931) on 2 December 1948. They had a daughter, Sima-Maria, and a son, Thomas. Bunting's <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1950) was published in Texas, with little involvement from Bunting. <span class="italic">The Spoils</span>, his penultimate sonata, draws on his wartime experiences, and also on his love of Persia and respect for its people and culture: &#145;Sooner or later we must absorb Islam if our own culture is not to die of anaemia&#146;, he wrote at a later date  (preface to <span class="italic">Omar Pound: Arabic and Persian Poems</span>, 1970, 5).<br>
<br>The family was ejected from Persia by Mossadeq in 1952, and returned to live in Throckley, Northumberland, with Bunting's mother. Bunting scratched a living for his family from local journalism for the <span class="italic">Newcastle Journal</span> and the <span class="italic">Newcastle Evening Chronicle</span>, and had little time for poetry. The poetry world, for its part, had, he thought, forgotten him. But in the early 1960s younger poets including Gael Turnbull and Jonathan Williams &#145;rediscovered&#146; him, and in 1964 the young Tyneside poet Tom Pickard visited him, starting a friendship which led to the composition of Bunting's final sonata, <span class="italic">Briggflatts</span>, and its subsequent publication by Stuart Montgomery's influential Fulcrum Press.<br>
<br>With the exception of the few poems included in Pound's <span class="italic">Active Anthology</span> (1933), the work published by Fulcrum Press, including <span class="italic">Loquitur</span> (1965) and <span class="italic">Briggflatts</span> (1966), were Bunting's first British publications. <span class="italic">Briggflatts</span> is at once a modernist poem, cropped from an alleged 2000 lines to a compressed and often elliptical 700, and a romantic celebration of seasons, homecoming, and love, intensely musical both in its patterning of sound and in overall structure. It stands as the high point of Bunting's maturity, and as testimony to a career of long, often isolated development. After it, he was able to complete only a handful of fine poems. For a generation of younger poets it also stands as a unique achievement of English modernism, providing a link with the world of high modernism which had been lacking in British poetry.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Briggflatts</span> was first performed at Morden Tower, the Newcastle reading venue established by Connie and Tom Pickard, in December 1965, the year in which Fulcrum Press published <span class="italic">Loquitur</span>, Bunting's first extensive collection published in Britain. In 1966 <span class="italic">Briggflatts</span> appeared in the Chicago magazine <span class="italic">Poetry</span>, and in a Fulcrum edition, which was greeted with widespread critical acclaim. Reviewing it, Cyril Connolly spoke for many:<blockquote>I was quite unprepared for <span class="italic">Briggflatts</span> which seems to me one of the best poems I have read and reread for a long time &hellip; In Bunting there is a lyrical note which he has been steadily compressing and which makes <span class="italic">Briggflatts</span> almost all lyric, or rather intensely musical; the words shine like hoarfrost. (<span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, 12 Feb 1967)</blockquote>Bunting's <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> followed in 1968. Critical recognition in the USA and UK continued to grow, and in 1968 Bunting was appointed Northern Arts literary fellow at the universities of Durham and Newcastle, where he gave the series of lectures on poetry now published as <span class="italic">Basil Bunting on Poetry</span> (2000). Although further honours followed, including an honorary DLitt from Newcastle University in 1971, and the inevitable presidencies of the Poetry Society (1972) and of Northern Arts (1974&#150;7), his reputation remained somewhat begrudged in Britain, and he lived the remainder of his days in poverty in his native Northumbria, dying in Hexham General Hospital, Northumberland, on 17 April 1985. Following cremation, his ashes were distributed at Briggflatts Quaker meeting-house, Sedbergh. In these closing years of his life he performed two acts of editorial piety in the editing of <span class="italic">Selected Poems of Ford Madox Ford</span> (1971) and the Northumbrian pitman poet Joseph Skipsey (1976): this juxtaposition of modernist and local values says much about Bunting's intention, and his consistency.<br>
<br>Today Bunting's work has a steady readership, and is represented in most of the major anthologies; it is hard to imagine his work being out of print again. This has not always been the case: Bunting's late recognition in his own country was at once a product of his wandering life, a consequence of his outspoken criticism of the literary establishment in Britain, and due to a mistrust of his strong associations with the great modernists, after they ceased to be fashionable. He was unashamedly international in an age when much British poetry was arguably insular or parochial. Out of such elements, and knowledge of his poetic &#145;masters&#146; Dante and Villon, and other Latin, Persian, Welsh, and classical writers, he constructed a human and evocative modernist poetry built upon the sound of words, intended to be read aloud, harking back to the oral traditions of his Northumbrian nurse: &#145;Poetry, like music, is to be heard&#146;, he insisted  (Bunting, &#145;The poet's point of view&#146;, <span class="italic">Diary of North-Eastern Association for the Arts</span>, April&#150;Summer 1966, 2).<br>
