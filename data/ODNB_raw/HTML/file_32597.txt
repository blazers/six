<span class="headword">Cowie,  William Garden</span>  (1831&#150;1902), <span class="occ">bishop of Auckland</span>, was born in London on 8 January 1831, the second son of Alexander Cowie (1802/3&#150;1843), advocate, of St John's Wood, London, formerly of Auchterless, Aberdeenshire, and his wife, Elizabeth, also from Aberdeenshire, who was the daughter of Alexander Garden. After his father's death his mother ran a boarding school. Cowie was admitted as a pensioner of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, on 20 May 1852 and elected scholar in the following October. He gained the second highest mark of his year in the law tripos of 1854 and also gained a first class mark in theology. He graduated BA in 1855, MA in 1865, and DD in 1869. Ordained deacon in 1854 and priest in 1855, he was curate of St Clement's, Cambridge, in 1854 and of Moulton in Suffolk from 1855 to 1857.<br>
<br>Appointed, in 1857, assistant chaplain in the Bengal establishment of the East India Company, Cowie was seconded to the army and in 1858 was present at the capture of Lucknow (receiving medal and clasp) and at the battles of Aliganj, Ruyah, and Bareilly. He accompanied Sir Neville Chamberlain's column in the Afghan campaign of 1863&#150;4 (medal and clasp), and in 1864 acted as domestic and examining chaplain to G. E. L. Cotton, bishop of Calcutta. In 1865 he was chaplain in Kashmir; he worked with Dr Elmslie at the Punjab missions, warmly supported the work of the Church Missionary Society at Srinagar, and wrote <span class="italic">Notes on the Temples of Cashmere</span>.<br>
<br>In 1867 Cowie returned to England and became rector of Stafford. In 1868 Bishop G. A. Selwyn, after moving from the see of New Zealand to that of Lichfield, was empowered by the diocesan synod of Auckland to choose a successor for that diocese. He nominated Cowie, who, in 1869, was consecrated bishop of Auckland in Westminster Abbey. In the same year he married Eliza Jane (<i>d</i>. 1902), eldest daughter of William Webber of Moulton, Suffolk, and granddaughter of Sir Thomas Preston, bt, of Beeston Hall, Norfolk. They had six children, of whom two sons died in infancy; of their surviving three sons and one daughter, two sons were ordained.<br>
<br>Cowie readily won the confidence of the settlers, diligently visiting all parts of his diocese. He found many of the Maori alienated by the war, but was able to encourage the native ministry to establish native church boards in his northern archdeaconries. He ordained three Maori deacons in 1872, and went on to ordain twenty-eight in total during his episcopate. He promoted the development of St John's College, Auckland (for ordination candidates), of which he was visitor and governor, and in 1880 was made a fellow of the University of New Zealand and the Auckland University Council, 1883. He supported the Sailor's Home, Institute for the Blind, and the Women's Home in Auckland.<br>
<br>Cowie returned to England for the Lambeth conference of 1888 and in the same year published an account of his diocese, <span class="italic">Our Last Year in New Zealand</span>. In 1895 he was made primate of New Zealand. He visited England again for the diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria and for the Lambeth conference of 1897, receiving in that year an honorary degree of DD from the University of Oxford. He resigned his see in 1902 because of poor health, but died at Bishopscourt, Auckland, New Zealand, on 26 June 1902, before his resignation took effect. He was given a military funeral and buried at St Stephen's cemetery, Tararua, Parnell, on 29 June.<br>
