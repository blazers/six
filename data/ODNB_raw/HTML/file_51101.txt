<span class="headword">Bancroft,  William James</span>  (1871&#150;1959), <span class="occ">rugby player and cricketer</span>, was born on 2 March 1871 in the Carmarthen Arms, Waterloo Street, Swansea, Glamorgan, the eldest of the eleven children of William Bancroft (1848&#150;1906), cobbler and cricket professional, and his wife, Emma Jones. At two years of age William junior went to live with his grandfather in the groundsman's cottage in the south-west corner of St Helen's football and cricket field in Swansea (he attended St Helen's elementary school). He lived there until his marriage in 1892 to Harriet Florence Turner (<i>d</i>. 1934), with whom he had four daughters and three sons.<br>
<br>Reared in the atmosphere of the famous rugby ground, Bancroft came into regular contact with footballers and cricketers, and by the age of sixteen was playing rugby for the local Excelsiors. He soon progressed via the established Bryn-y-m&ocirc;r team to the senior Swansea side, for whom he played his first game against Newport on 5 October 1889. After only seventeen games with &#145;the whites&#146; he won his first international cap, without a trial, when the player originally selected, Newport's Tom England, broke his leg and was forced to withdraw. Bancroft stepped in to make his d&eacute;but against Scotland at Cardiff Arms Park on 1 February 1890, and went on to win an uninterrupted sequence of thirty-three caps, a record for a Welsh full-back not broken until 1975, by J. P. R. Williams.<br>
<br>Known variously as Billy, Banky, or W. J., Bancroft captained the Swansea club in 1893&#150;4 and for a further five seasons between 1896 and 1901 in a playing career that ended only in 1905 when he received a testimonial of &pound;322 from his admirers. By then he was recognized as one of the leading Welsh sportsmen of his time. He captained Wales on eleven occasions and was the first Welsh player to be a member of two triple crown sides, those of 1893 and 1900. In 1893 on the occasion of England's first ever visit to Cardiff Arms Park, his combination of total self-confidence and assiduously practised goal-kicking enabled him to drop-kick a last-minute penalty goal virtually from the touchline to score a 12&#150;11 victory and set Wales on the road to its first triple crown. He took every free kick, penalty, and conversion awarded to Wales between 1890 and 1901, scoring sixty points in all.<br>
<br>At 5 feet 5&frac12; inches in height, and weighing little over 10 stones&#151;albeit &#145;ten stones of fencing wire fitted with the electricity of life&#146; according to the <span class="italic">Bristol Evening News</span> in January 1903  (Farmer, 71)&#151;Bancroft was not best equipped to meet the stern defensive requirements of the full-back position. But he was sturdier than he looked, and this, allied to speed and &#145;a cock-sureness that terrified selectors and aggravated anxious spectators&#146;  (Owen), more than compensated. Reckoned to be the fastest man over 25 yards in the Swansea team, he possessed a change of pace, a sidestep, and a sharp eye for an opening. He also had a rare ability to kick long and accurately from the hand while running at speed; he was perhaps the first running full-back the game had seen, even if his running was aimed more at tiring the opposition than linking with his team-mates. His favourite ploy was to tease lumbering forwards into chasing him from one side of the field to the other until he eventually banged the ball into touch over their exhausted heads. Well groomed and dapper, even something of a dandy with his trim moustache and jaunty walk, he was the inevitable target of less fastidious opponents, and when the boisterous Ryan brothers eventually caught him in the Irish match at Cardiff in 1899, they threw him into the crowd, cracking a few of his ribs in the process.<br>
<br>Like his father, Bancroft played cricket as well as rugby for Swansea. Both his father and his grandfather were professional cricketers with the Swansea club, established in 1850, and Bancroft himself became in 1895 the first regular professional to be employed, at &pound;2 a week to supplement his meagre income as a cobbler, by the recently founded (1889) Glamorgan County Cricket Club. His quick reflexes and sure catching at full-back in rugby owed a good deal to the safe hands of the cricketer who enjoyed fielding in suicide positions close to the wicket. A right-handed batsman, medium-paced bowler, and wicket-keeper, he was a fine all-rounder whose services were crucial to Glamorgan's survival in the minor counties' championship in the early 1900s. In a cricketing career of 230 matches between 1889 and 1914 he scored over 8000 runs, making his first-class d&eacute;but in June 1910 for the west of England at Cardiff, and playing for south Wales against the South African tourists at Swansea in June 1912. He retained his association with St Helen's after retiring by opening a sports shop close to the ground, and in the inter-war years acting as steward in the members' enclosure, invariably sitting at the bottom of the pavilion steps.<br>
<br>William's brother Jack Bancroft (1879&#150;1942) followed him in playing cricket for Glamorgan from 1908 to 1922 and winning thirteen caps for Wales at full-back between 1908 and 1912, scoring 88 points. When the writer A. A. Thomson told a Welsh friend that as a boy he had &#145;seen and admired the great Bancroft&#146; in 1912, he was told in return that &#145;maybe the man you saw was wonderful &hellip; but he was not the great Bancroft. He was merely the great Bancroft's little brother.&#146; Thomson concluded that &#145;if W. J. was all that better than J. he must have had wings as well&#146;  (Thomson, 59). Bancroft died at the house of his eldest son, Reginald, Killeen, Higher Lane, Langland, Swansea, on 3 March 1959 and was buried at Oystermouth three days later.<br>
