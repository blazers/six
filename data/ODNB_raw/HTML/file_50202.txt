<span class="headword">Reading,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1368/9), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and historian</span>, was a monk of Westminster Abbey by 1339/40 and had been priested by 1341/2, when he sang his first mass. He is recorded as <i>custos ordinis</i> of the abbey in 1349, and from 1350 to 1353 he held the office of infirmarer. His death is recorded in the abbey's infirmary roll for 1368/9. He wrote a continuation of the <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span>, the St Albans chronicle acquired by Westminster Abbey in 1265 and thereafter augmented by a series of independent narratives. Reading's continuation covers the period 1346&#150;67, though it was not begun until 1366 and the chronology of some of its earlier sections is distinctly confused. Down to 1356 the account of Edward III's French wars is dependent on the chronicle of Robert of Avesbury; Reading also drew on the continuation of the <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span> of Ranulf Higden. After 1356, however, the account appears to be independent, or at least to draw on sources now lost. Reading provides one of the most detailed accounts of English history in the 1360s, a period otherwise largely devoid of good historical writing.<br>
<br>Reading apologized for his lack of learning; certainly, the work has little literary merit and the Latin is sometimes ungrammatical. On the other hand, it represents a very interesting catalogue of information drawn together by a well-informed man living in close proximity to the centres of political power in Westminster and London. The chronicle includes a good deal of material on the internal history of Westminster Abbey: for example, Reading blamed the financial problems of the abbey in the mid-fourteenth century on the extravagance of Abbot Simon Bircheston (1344&#150;9), and recounted the visit of Edward III to the abbey church on the eve of his departure for France in 1359. However, the chronicle is much more than a set of monastic annals, and provides information and commentary on the black death and its socio-economic consequences, various items of parliamentary legislation from the <span class="roman">Statute of Labourers</span> (1351) to the abolition of &#145;Peter's pence&#146; (1365), the contemporary tensions between the black monks and the friars, and the ratification of the treaty of Calais (1360) in the parliament of 1361. Reading was highly critical of the mores of the age, and regarded the plague as God's vengeance on an unworthy people; he also contributed to the contemporary debate on the laziness and wilfulness of the labouring classes. His moralizing is typical of the reactionary attitudes of the upper classes&#151;and particularly of the monastic orders&#151;during the period of turmoil that followed the black death.<br>
<br>John Reading's chronicle survives in only one medieval manuscript  (BL, Cotton MS Cleopatra A.xvi). However, a number of later chronicles (various continuations of the <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span> and the chronicle of Adam Murimuth, and especially the St Albans <span class="italic">Historia Anglicana</span> and the continuation of the English <span class="italic">Brut</span> chronicle) borrowed extensively and sometimes transcribed or translated directly from Reading; this indicates that other manuscripts of the latter's text must have circulated in the later fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Slight variations and a greater degree of accuracy in certain of the relevant passages in the <span class="italic">Historia Anglicana</span> and the <span class="italic">Brut</span> also suggest that the surviving manuscript is a slightly inferior transcription of Reading's lost original.<br>
