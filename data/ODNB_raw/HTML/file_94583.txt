<span class="headword">Meadows,  Bernard William</span>  (1915&#150;2005), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born at 354 Unthank Road, Norwich, on 19 February 1915, the son of William Arthur Frederick Meadows, a solicitor's clerk, and later insurance clerk, and his wife, Ethel Maud, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Blowers. He attended the City of Norwich School, where he remembered art as &#145;the only thing I could do&#146;  (Woollcombe, tape 7). When he left school at the age of sixteen in the middle of the great depression he was persuaded by his father to take a secure job in an accountants' office. Finally, in 1934, he was allowed to enrol at Norwich School of Art.<br>
<br>In 1936, through a friend of his wood-engraving teacher, Meadows was introduced to the sculptor Henry Moore. As a result he was invited to become Moore's studio assistant, and worked for him during the holidays in Kent and Hertfordshire, on and off until the late 1940s, assisting with his carvings and early experiments in lead casting. They developed a strong relationship that lasted for fifty years. Through this connection, Meadows was introduced to avant-garde artistic circles, and was able to exhibit at the International Surrealist Exhibition held in London in 1936, alongside Moore and Pablo Picasso. Meadows was drawn to surrealism, a thread that underlies his entire oeuvre, but he preferred the work of Picasso, with &#145;its flickering nervousness&#146;, to that of Moore  (Woollcombe, tape 103).<br>
<br>Later in 1936 Meadows moved from Norwich to London to study painting at Chelsea School of Art (1936&#150;7), and then at the Royal College of Art (1938&#150;40), where his education was interrupted soon after the outbreak of the Second World War. On 11 October 1939 he had married the 23-year-old Marjorie Winifred Payne, whom he had met at Norwich School of Art. She was the daughter of Albert Carswell Payne, schoolmaster. They made their first home in Moore's former studio in Hampstead, continuing to live in the area all their married life. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>Meadows had joined the Communist Party in the 1930s and, at the beginning of the war, declared himself a conscientious objector. However, he changed his mind in 1941, when Germany invaded Russia, and joined the Royal Air Force as part of the air&#150;sea rescue squad. He saw little action, and suffered rather from boredom, though it was a formative period for his art. He was posted to India, Ceylon, and the Cocos Islands, in the Indian Ocean, where he spent his spare time painting and sketching. He became fascinated with the creatures of the Cocos Islands, particularly the giant crabs, which paraded menacingly along the beach, creating a &#145;sort of set up of fear&#146;, analogous in his eyes to human society  (Woollcombe, tape 47). The crab, with its armoured exterior and soft interior, became a recurring theme in his work.<br>
<br>Meadows returned to the Royal College of Art in 1946, joining the sculpture course for his last year. Afterwards, he taught at Chelsea College of Art (1948&#150;60), and occasionally at the Bath Academy of Art, Corsham Court (1955&#150;7). In the 1950s and 1960s he made a series of sculptures of &#145;cocks&#146;, &#145;crabs&#146; and dead birds, which he described as &#145;human substitutes &hellip; vehicles expressing my feelings about human beings&#146;, appearing variously as &#145;hysterical&#146; and &#145;domineering&#146;  (Robertson). Together with his Chelsea students Elizabeth Frink and Robert Clatworthy he was important in the revival of interest in animal sculpture in post-war Britain. He was an accomplished and prolific draughtsman, who developed his sculpture through his drawing. However, after his student days he never drew from life. Throughout his career he almost obsessively worked and reworked a few chosen themes, allowing the forms to emerge through the drawing process.<br>
<br>Meadows rose to fame at the Venice Biennale of 1952, where he was selected to represent Britain alongside his contemporaries Eduardo Paolozzi, William Turnbull, Robert Adams, and Kenneth Armitage, as well as Moore. Though ultimately a disparate group, the younger artists were heralded as the successors to Moore and Hepworth by the art critic Herbert Read, who described their work as depicting &#145;excoriated flesh, frustrated sex, the geometry of fear&#146;  (Read, introduction to <span class="italic">New Aspects of British Sculpture</span>, British Council, 1952). Meadows went on to have a series of solo shows at Gimpel Fils, London, and Paul Rosenberg, New York, in the late 1950s and 1960s, and produced a massive bronze, <span class="italic">The Spirit of Trade Unionism</span>, for the entrance to the Trades Union Congress's headquarters, Congress House, in Great Russell Street, London.<br>
<br>The turning point in Meadows's career came when he was appointed professor of sculpture at the Royal College of Art (1960&#150;80). Under his direction, sculptors as diverse as Nigel Hall, Martin Naylor, William Pye, and Tony Cragg graduated from the department. Meadows became a leader of his profession, serving on public bodies such as the Arts Council's art panel and the royal fine art commission, and acting as governor for schools of art at Norwich, Chelsea, Corsham, and Bristol. Nevertheless, he remained a modest and retiring man: a sceptic and not fundamentally &#145;a joiner in&#146;  (Woollcombe, tape 93). The 1960s and 1970s were also a productive period for Meadows's own work, as he had studio space at the Royal College and established an in-house foundry. He preferred bronze casting to carving, though he often worked over the surfaces of his plaster models. He was closely involved in the casting of his work and almost always patinated and polished it himself, as he became increasingly interested in qualities of surface.<br>
<br>In the early 1960s, following a visit to Florence, Meadows turned to the human figure in his work with a series of &#145;armed&#146; figures and busts. These were images of bullies, inspired by Renaissance statues of Roman emperors and military leaders, with such titles as <span class="italic">Augustus</span>, <span class="italic">Brutus</span>, and <span class="italic">Personnage tr&egrave;s important</span>. He described them as &#145;armoured, aggressive, protected, but inside the safety of the shell, completely soft and vulnerable&#146;  (Bowness, 15). He developed the seated &#145;armed&#146; figures into pointing figures, inspired by a photograph of the film director Luchino Visconti. These became the vehicle for another change: from the dark, craggy surfaces of his earlier bronzes, to the bright, smooth finishes of his later works, like <span class="italic">Help</span> (1966) and <span class="italic">Lovers</span> (1980). From the mid-1960s his sculpture had a more erotic charge, with soft, bulbous forms, appearing as fruit, eyes, and other body parts, encased within or squeezed between other harder, more angular shapes. In 1967 he executed thirty-four etchings and a box for an edition of Samuel Beckett's <span class="italic">Molloy</span> (1951), sharing the author's interest in existentialism.<br>
<br>Meadows was the only British sculptor at the Venice Biennale in 1964, and in the 1970s he had solo shows in Paris, London, and Tokyo. He was selected for key group shows including &#145;Sculpture of the 1970s&#146;, at the Royal Academy, London, in 1972. Throughout his career he accepted relatively few commissions, preferring to concentrate on his own work. His major public sculpture of this period was for the new headquarters of Eastern Counties Newspapers in his native Norwich in 1969&#150;70.<br>
<br>After retiring from the Royal College in 1980 Meadows became closely involved with the Henry Moore Foundation, serving as acting director from 1983 to 1988. In this late period he focused mostly on drawing. He had a major retrospective at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 1995. He lived latterly in Belsize Grove, Hampstead, and died at the Royal Free Hospital, Camden, on 12 January 2005, of an internal haemorrhage. He was survived by his wife and daughters.<br>
