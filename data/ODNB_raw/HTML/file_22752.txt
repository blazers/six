<span class="headword">Prise, Sir  John</span> <span class="st"> [Syr Si&ocirc;n ap Rhys]</span>  (1501/2&#150;1555), <span class="occ">administrator and scholar</span>, was born between 12 October 1501 and 11 October 1502, the son of Rhys ap Gwilym ap Llywelyn of Brecon and Gwenllian, daughter of Hywel ap Madog. After study at Oxford University and practice in the court of arches he graduated BCL at Cambridge in 1535/6. However, the crucial step in his career had been taken by 1530, when he is found in the service of Thomas Cromwell. Appointed registrar-general in ecclesiastical causes on 1 September 1534, Prise played a direct role in the dissolution of the monasteries, both as visitor in 1535&#151;when he urged the virtues of a moderate approach in the face of the arrogant, even violent, behaviour of his fellow visitor, Thomas Lee&#151;and as a commissioner for the surrender of monasteries in Hampshire, Wiltshire, and Gloucestershire in late 1539 and early 1540. He also participated in other aspects of the turbulent politics of the 1530s, being involved in the search for incriminating documents in the bishop of Durham's palace in 1532; recording, as a public notary, the interrogations of various rebels and traitors in the Tower of London, including Bishop John Fisher and Sir Thomas More, as well as of participants in Hallam's rebellion at Kingston upon Hull early in 1537; and drawing up documents relating to Henry VIII's divorces of Anne Boleyn (at whose marriage in 1533 Prise had been a servitor) and Anne of Cleves.<br>
<br>On 11 October 1534 Prise, aged thirty-two, married Joan Williamson (<i>b</i>. 1515/16), aged eighteen, niece by marriage to Cromwell, at the latter's house in Islington. This may not have been Prise's first marriage, for his will refers to a married daughter apparently older than any of the eleven children he had with Joan. The first four of those children were born in London, and the godparents after whom they were named reflect their father's connections in the city: the eldest son, Gregory, was named after Thomas Cromwell's son, the second surviving son, Richard, after Cromwell's nephew, Richard Williams, and the eldest daughter, Eleanor, after the wife of Christopher Barker, Garter king of arms.<br>
<br>Although Prise retained royal favour following Cromwell's execution in July 1540 he was never again to play such a central role in public affairs as he had in the 1530s. Instead his public career entered a new phase, focused mainly on Wales and its borders. From 8 June 1540 he had the lease, and from 13 November 1542 the grant in fee, of the dissolved Benedictine priory of St Guthlac at Hereford, which he seems to have made his principal residence, for it was the birthplace of his fifth and subsequent children from 1542 onwards. He was also granted Brecon Priory in fee in 1542, though he never resided there. In the meantime, on 27 September 1540 Prise was appointed secretary for life of the council in the marches of Wales, subsequently serving the crown in a variety of capacities, for example, as sheriff of Brecknockshire (1542&#150;3) and justice of the peace in Herefordshire and numerous other counties.<br>
<br>Prise was knighted two days after Edward VI's coronation, on 22 February 1547, and was elected MP for Brecknockshire in the same year: the poet Lewys Morgannwg aptly likened his progress to &#145;a long summer's day&#146; in 1548  (Gruffydd, &#145;The earliest Welsh printed book&#146;, 106). In 1552 he was admitted at Doctors' Commons. Nor was Prise's success clouded by the accession of Queen Mary, for he sat in the first three Marian parliaments without opposing measures to restore Catholicism, and also dedicated a treatise on the coinage to the queen. He died at St Guthlac's Priory, Hereford, on 15 October 1555, survived by his wife and ten of their children, leaving lands worth about &pound;135 per annum together with numerous bequests, including 1000 marks for the dowries of his daughters. His will, made nine days earlier, was essentially Catholic in character, bequeathing his soul to God, to &#145;owre blessede ladie Sainte Marye And to all the blessed cumpanie of heavin&#146;  (Morgan, 255), and requesting prayers on its behalf. He asked to be buried in Hereford Cathedral.<br>
<br>Although critical of the monasteries he helped to dissolve, Prise also played an important role, which has been compared to that of Bale and Leland, in collecting and studying monastic manuscripts, of which he owned or annotated more than a hundred; in his will he urged his son Richard to arrange for the publication of the works of William of Malmesbury and other medieval historians in his collection. His familiarity with medieval texts informed his two best-known works, the <span class="italic">Historiae Brytannicae defensio</span> (probably completed by 1547 though not published until 1573), a measured refutation of Polydore Vergil's attack on Geoffrey of Monmouth's account of early British history, and <span class="italic">Yny lhyvyr hwnn &hellip;</span> (&#145;In this book &hellip;&#146;), attributed to Prise by Richard Davies, bishop of St David's in 1567, a compilation of religious texts in Welsh, including the creed and Lord's prayer, published in 1546 and the earliest known printed book in Welsh. Drawing extensively on medieval Welsh religious texts, the latter compilation reveals not only a deep dissatisfaction with the failure of the clergy to provide elementary religious instruction but also an awareness, shared by other contemporary Welsh humanists, of the potential of print as a means of preserving and disseminating the vernacular literary heritage of Wales. Though he certainly carved a successful public career through his prudently supple commitment to the Tudor regime, it is as &#145;a lover of antiquity&#146;, to quote Leland's tribute  (Gruffydd, &#145;The earliest Welsh printed book&#146;, 109), that Prise enjoys his greatest reputation.<br>
