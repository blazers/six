<span class="headword">Ward,  Thomas</span>, Baron Ward in the nobility of the Austrian empire  (1810&#150;1858), <span class="occ">jockey and finance minister</span>, was born on 9 October 1810, the elder son of William Ward of Howden in Yorkshire and his wife, Margaret Marvil of York. He was educated at the national school in York until the age of nine, when he was sent to work in the stables of Robert Ridsdale, possibly at Merton. He was sent to Vienna, where he was jockey to Prince Wenzel zu Liechtenstein from 1826 to 1828, and head groom to Count Francis Hunyady from 1829 to 1831. He was recommended to Charles Louis of Bourbon, duke of Lucca, a great lover of horses, who made him his personal valet. He became the duke's confidential adviser, and in this position suggested that the political independence of Lucca be relinquished to Austria in exchange for relief of the duke's personal financial embarrassment. This end was achieved in 1843 in a meeting between Ward and Archduke Ferdinand. In 1846 he was promoted to be master of the horse and to be director-general of finance, with the title of baron. He is said to have sought popularity by arbitrarily lowering the price of corn, and the partial repudiation or &#145;reduction&#146; of the debt of Lucca is also attributed to his counsels. In 1847, on the death of the Archduchess Marie Louise, duchess of Parma, and former empress of the French, Ward was sent on a mission to Florence to superintend the details of the transfer of Lucca to Tuscany in accordance with the convention of 1818, by which Charles Louis also succeeded to the duchy of Parma.<br>
<br>At Parma Ward remained chief minister to the duke, and continued his subservience to the Austrian government, acting as an Austrian agent during the revolutions of 1848 and negotiating the abdication of his old patron in May 1849 and the placing of Charles Louis's son, Duke Charles III, on the throne of Parma. He remained in Vienna as minister-plenipotentiary representing the duchy, and the emperor made him a baron of the Austrian empire. He had married in 1838 Louise Genthner, who came from a Viennese family of housekeepers and domestic servants, and had three sons and a daughter. In 1850 he acquired an estate, Urschendorff, near Vienna, from which he was periodically summoned by Charles III to attend to the chaotic finances of the ducal household. He was regarded with deep suspicion by many at the Parmesan court, particularly by the ultra-legitimist and anti-Austrian Duchess Marie Louise. On 21 July 1853 he received a patent of concession of all the mining rights over iron and copper in the duchy of Parma.<br>
<br>In 1854 Duke Charles III was assassinated, reputedly by Mazzinians, and Ward was dismissed from all his offices, with some ignominy, and his mining concessions were withdrawn, the duchess regent suspecting him of designs on the sovereignty of Parma. He retired completely from public life, devoting himself to farming, his family, and litigation for the restoration of his mining concessions, in which he had made considerable capital investments. Shortly before his death his suit succeeded. He patented a steam reaping machine, which won the gold medal at the Vienna Exhibition of 1857. He died at Urschendorff on 5 October 1858.<br>
<br>Dedicated to maintaining the absolutist dukes on their thrones, Ward was constantly hampered by the weakness and indecision of his masters. Despite his meteoric career, he remained &#145;simple, sometimes even uncouth&#146; in manner  (Lamington, 60), and, with little formal education, spoke and wrote in French, German, and Italian, conducting the affairs of state with &#145;considerable cleverness, if not with remarkable straightforwardness&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 535).<br>
