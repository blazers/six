<span class="headword">Llywelyn ap Gruffudd</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1282), <span class="occ">prince of Wales</span>, was the second of four sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11696/', "Gruffudd ap Llywelyn (d. 1244)")</script> and his wife, Senana, and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16874/', "Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (c.1173&#150;1240)")</script>. Llywelyn ab Iorwerth was succeeded as prince of Gwynedd by his younger and legitimate son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7323/', "Dafydd ap Llywelyn")</script> who, in response to the challenge presented by his elder and bastard brother, Gruffudd ap Llywelyn, immediately placed him in prison. Owain, Gruffudd's eldest son, shared his father's captivity. The younger sons <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7324/', "Dafydd ap Gruffudd")</script> and Rhodri, who were not yet of age, were placed in the custody of Henry III as sureties for their mother's good faith in an agreement made with the king by which she sought to secure her husband's release from Dafydd ap Llywelyn's prison. Llywelyn, who was probably now aged about nineteen, is not mentioned in the record of Senana's negotiations with the king, and he appears to have acted independently at this time. By a charter probably given in the summer of 1241, when his father and Owain were transferred to Henry's custody, Llywelyn ceded all claim upon the Mortimer lordships of Maelienydd and Gwrtheyrnion in eastern central Wales, an indication that Ralph Mortimer already recognized the young man's capability and considered it prudent to obtain the release. Llywelyn established lordship in Dyffryn Clwyd, one of the Four Cantrefs of Perfeddwlad, that part of Gwynedd which lay east of the Conwy. When in 1244 war broke out between Dafydd ap Llywelyn and Henry III, Llywelyn soon identified himself with his uncle's cause. He was thus placed in a strong position when, on 25 February 1246, Dafydd died without an heir. Owain returned from England, but he could do no more than agree to a division of the patrimony between Llywelyn and himself, an arrangement confirmed by Henry III in the treaty of Woodstock on 30 April 1247.<h2>
<a name="MasteryoverGwyneddandsupremacyoverWales"></a>Mastery over Gwynedd and supremacy over Wales</h2>Owain and Llywelyn were confined to Gwynedd Uwch Conwy, the land centred on Snowdonia west of the Conwy, yielding Perfeddwlad to the king. By 1253 their brother Dafydd ap Gruffudd was asserting his right to a share of the inheritance. Henry took his fealty and urged his elder brothers to provide for him &#145;according to the custom of Wales&#146;. Owain may have been prepared to accept the adjustment, but Llywelyn was determined to resist a further partition. He made certain proposals to the king &#145;concerning his brothers&#146;, possibly urging that provision be made for Dafydd, and perhaps Rhodri, in Perfeddwlad. No solution was found by negotiation and the issue was resolved by armed conflict in June 1255 when Owain and Dafydd were defeated by Llywelyn at the battle of Bryn Derwin. The vanquished brothers were imprisoned, and Llywelyn consolidated his hold upon Gwynedd Uwch Conwy in its entirety. In November 1256, after a pause of sixteen months, Llywelyn extended his power over the whole of Perfeddwlad except for the two castles of Diserth and Deganwy. Aided by the support of the inhabitants, who nurtured grievances against the officers who had served the king and the Lord Edward, Llywelyn was able to liberate the land by a swift campaign. Henry, insufficiently attentive both to the dynastic problems of Gwynedd and the difficulties confronting the communities of the Four Cantrefs, and unable to appreciate the possibility of a link between them, found his entire settlement of north Wales undermined. With his annexation of Meirionydd immediately afterwards Llywelyn completed the reintegration of the patrimony of his grandfather. Owain would spend another twenty years in confinement, but Dafydd, released before the advance into Perfeddwlad, was given an estate in that area, to be held as a tenant of his brother.<br>
<br>Llywelyn moved without delay to establish a broad supremacy over the lands of other Welsh rulers, endeavouring to do so less by armed might than by drawing the rulers into a military alliance that he then sought to transform into a political association. Advancing southward to Deheubarth (south-west Wales) he won support in Ceredigion with the adherence of Maredudd ab Owain. In Ystrad Tywi he was already assured of the goodwill of Maredudd ap Rhys Gryg, who had joined him for the advance into Perfeddwlad. Together they secured possession of Ystrad Tywi to the exclusion of Maredudd's kinsman and adversary, Rhys Fychan. Rhys, however, quickly repaired to Llywelyn, leaving a royal army brought to his aid by Stephen Bauzan in June 1257 to suffer defeat at Cymerau, and he was reinstated in his portion of Ystrad Tywi. Maredudd thereupon transferred his loyalty to the crown and, after a return to Llywelyn's allegiance and a second defection, he was convicted of infidelity before the prince's council in 1259. Thereafter he acknowledged Llywelyn's supremacy only with the greatest reluctance. The prince was able to withstand Henry's campaign in the summer of 1257, when the king advanced to Deganwy and then withdrew, and improved his position when Gruffudd ap Madog of Powys Fadog (northern Powys) adhered to him. In Powys Wenwynwyn (southern Powys) Gruffudd ap Gwenwynwyn remained loyal to the crown, leaving his lands exposed to annexation by Llywelyn. The Welsh rulers, with very few exceptions, were leagued with him, and Matthew Paris was among English observers deeply impressed by the new unity established in Wales under the inspired leadership of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd.<br>
<br>The Welsh chronicle <span class="italic">Brut y tywysogyon</span> records that early in 1258 Llywelyn held an assembly of the magnates of Wales who swore an oath of allegiance to him. It is likely that each of them did homage to Llywelyn and that he thereby established a formal bond with the great majority of those who exercised lordship in the several parts of Powys and Deheubarth. The agreements had the support of the bishops of Bangor and St Asaph, who consented to apply ecclesiastical censure in the event of a breach of faith. In an agreement with a group of Scottish nobles in 1258 Llywelyn used the style &#145;prince of Wales&#146;, and although it would be some time before he used the title on a regular basis its use in that year reflects the emergence, from the initial military alliance, of a new political entity in the prince's lands.<h2>
<a name="Dominanceinthemarch"></a>Dominance in the march</h2>In the period 1258&#150;62 Llywelyn concentrated upon a quest for a peace treaty by which the king would recognize the political relationships that had now been created in Wales. The central issue was Llywelyn's plea that the homages of the Welsh princes, which historically had belonged to the king of England, should be granted to himself, and that he alone should do homage to the king. With Henry confronted in 1258 by a baronial opposition whose demands were reflected in the provisions of Oxford, the time might have seemed propitious for a Welsh diplomatic initiative and envoys were sent to the Oxford parliament. But there was little prospect of securing a settlement favourable to the prince, not least because marcher lords&#151;several of whom had been victims of Llywelyn's aggression&#151;held powerful positions in the royal council. Twice in 1260 Llywelyn launched an attack upon the royal castle of Builth to coincide with renewed diplomatic initiatives. He created consternation in the king's council and secured an extension of the truce first arranged at Oxford, but the peace treaty on which he set his mind remained elusive. After Henry reasserted his authority in 1261 their exchanges became more cordial and Llywelyn, commended for his restraint at the time of turmoil in the realm, was given some reason to believe that the king was serious in his declared readiness to discuss peace terms as well as a truce. The king's position is revealed more clearly, however, in letters written during his stay in France in July 1262 when, upon hearing rumour of the prince's death, he indicated his resolve to terminate the hegemony established by the prince of Gwynedd, and to restore the traditional and direct relationship between the crown and each of the lords of Wales. Llywelyn evidently sensed the king's true feelings. By the end of 1262 he had resumed armed conflict with a series of forceful campaigns in the Welsh march calculated to promote his continuing quest for a definitive peace treaty. It was at this time that he began to use regularly the style &#145;prince of Wales and lord of Snowdon&#146;.<br>
<br>Llywelyn's movements were concentrated first on Roger (III) Mortimer's lordship of Maelienydd, and then upon the lordship of Brecon and its environs as far as Abergavenny. While he intended a military response Henry indicated his readiness for negotiation, but the prospect of a peace settlement diminished in the spring of 1263 when Edward, upon his return from Gascony, intervened in the march in association with the prince's implacable opponent, Roger (III) Mortimer. No major campaign materialized even so, and the only tangible result of Edward's activity was an agreement with Dafydd ap Gruffudd upon his defection from Llywelyn. The summer saw considerable turmoil in the march. The prince's forces were engaged in a new offensive in the western portion of the lordship of Clun (that is, Tempsiter or Dyffryn Tefeidiad) about the time of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19049/', "Simon de Montfort's")</script> return from France. For a brief period Montfort supporters with territories in the Welsh march, including Roger de Clifford and Hamon L'Estrange, attacked royalist positions in the area. Gruffudd ap Gwenwynwyn, lord of Powys Wenwynwyn, seized the opportunity created by the disorder to resolve a dispute with Thomas Corbet over possession of the area known as Gorddwr on the right bank of the upper Severn. But, when Montfort's transitory adherents returned to the king's allegiance, Gruffudd was left bereft of marcher allies and negotiated an agreement with Llywelyn formalized by an act of homage and fealty on 12 December 1263.<br>
<br>Overt collaboration between the forces of Llywelyn and Montfort is indicated from the early months of 1264 with a joint attack on Mortimer's castle of Radnor. Llywelyn provided valuable aid upon Montfort's advances to Montgomery in July and to Worcester in December, when the presence of the prince's forces west of the Severn forced their opponents into submission. There is, however, no indication that any formal agreement of a political nature was made in the period when Montfort controlled the government of the realm. A treaty was made only in June 1265, and by then Montfort's power was crumbling. Envoys of Montfort, who was at Hereford, and those of Llywelyn, encamped at Pipton in the lordship of Brecon, negotiated an agreement sealed by Llywelyn on 17 June and issued in the king's name three days later. For a fine of &pound;20,000 Henry granted Llywelyn the lordship of all the barons of Wales, and the principality of Wales, to be held by the prince of Wales and the heirs of his body. Several of Llywelyn's annexations in the march were conceded to him. He may have been sceptical, however, that anything of permanent value would come of the agreement, and he may have endorsed the terms only as a basis for a treaty to be made when the king was able to act of his free will. Within days of the completion of the agreement, ordered government under Montfort's direction ceased. Though the earl moved to the Welsh march, there is no indication that he attempted to link up with Llywelyn's forces and, turning back to cross the Severn, he went to meet his death at Evesham.<h2>
<a name="ThetreatyofMontgomery1267"></a>The treaty of Montgomery, 1267</h2>Agreement between Llywelyn and the king would need to form part of a broader settlement of the problems that confronted the realm of England following civil war. Cardinal Ottobuono, the papal legate, found his mediation made difficult by deeply discordant views among the magnates over the treatment of the Montfortians. It was only when this issue had been resolved, following Gilbert de Clare's armed intervention in London on behalf of the &#145;disinherited&#146;, that Henry, on 24 July 1267, indicated his wish to open negotiations with Llywelyn. Envoys of king and prince were at work at Shrewsbury by late August, but after three weeks, when conduct of the negotiations was entrusted to Ottobuono, no treaty had been made. Agreement was finally reached on 25 September and four days later Llywelyn did homage to Henry at Rhydwhiman, the ford on the Severn that marked the frontier in the neighbourhood of Montgomery. By the treaty of Montgomery (29 September 1267) Henry granted Llywelyn and his successors by hereditary right the principality of Wales and the right to be called prince of Wales. He was granted the homage of all the Welsh lords of Wales, with the single exception of Maredudd ap Rhys Gryg. Llywelyn was required to pay 25,000 marks for the treaty, and a further 5000 marks if the king were ever to concede Maredudd's homage; 5000 marks were due immediately or by Christmas and the remainder in instalments of 3000 marks a year. Possession of Gwynedd was implicit in the king's grant, and the inclusion of the Four Cantrefs of Perfeddwlad was specifically stated. The homage of the Welsh lords, the key clause of the treaty, conveyed to Llywelyn overlordship of the several lands of the former principalities of Powys and Deheubarth. Llywelyn was required to cede his conquests, except that he was permitted to hold Gwrtheyrnion, Builth, Brecon, Ceri, Cedewain, and Whittington, lands which together represented a considerable extension of his authority into the march of Wales. He would be allowed Maelienydd if he could establish his right to it, and both the lands granted to him and others to which he laid claim could be made subject to legal process according to the custom of the march. Within his principality he was required, by a clause &#145;specially ordained&#146;, to provide for Dafydd ap Gruffudd, either by restoring what he had held before his defection or by making further provision in accordance with the decision of named magnates of Wales, or, if necessary, by doing justice according to the laws and customs of Wales in the presence of men who would inform the king of the decision. The treaty contained several clauses that were potentially contentious, but Ottobuono felt able to commend it as an honourable settlement which brought hope of an enduring peace between two peoples who had been in prolonged conflict.<h2>
<a name="PrinceofWalesmarcherlordsandEdwardI"></a>Prince of Wales, marcher lords, and Edward I</h2>Only ten years after Llywelyn won formal recognition as prince of Wales the principality was dismembered, leaving him to make peace with Edward I on humiliating terms. Historians have often sought to explain the reversal in his fortunes by emphasizing the prince's intransigent attitude to the crown after Edward's accession at the end of 1272. Edward, however, left the kingdom upon a crusade in August 1270 and was away until August 1274, a four-year period which saw a marked deterioration in Llywelyn's relations with the royal government. Problems arose in the march, partly the result of Llywelyn's intervention with armed force in Gilbert de Clare's lordship of Glamorgan. His claim to the homage of Gruffudd ap Rhys of Senghennydd was emphatically rejected by Clare, who rightly held that Gruffudd was a mesne tenant of his marcher dominion. Clare was incensed at a decision by Edward to endorse Llywelyn's parallel claim to the homage of Maredudd ap Gruffudd, who held his lands as a tenant of Clare in the lordship of Caerleon. Clare embarked on the construction of Caerphilly Castle in 1268 and, upon Edward's departure for the crusade, seized the opportunity to resolve the problems in Caerleon and Senghennydd unilaterally. By 1272 Llywelyn had been forced to withdraw from Glamorgan with nothing to show for a prolonged and costly enterprise. To the north of Glamorgan lay the lordship of Brecon where Humphrey (VI) de Bohun sought to reassert authority in a land formally conceded to the prince in 1267, and Llywelyn had to take stern measures to retain the fidelity of some of his Welsh tenants there. With Roger Mortimer now a regent of the realm, Llywelyn feared that Bohun and other marchers would gain the support of the king's council in their attempts to reassert their position. Exchanges over Llywelyn's building of the castle of Dolforwyn in his lordship of Cedewain, and over Mortimer's work at Cefnllys in Maelienydd, reveal the animosity between the two men.<br>
<br>Llywelyn's failure to appear at the ford of Montgomery to swear fealty to the king in January 1273 may have been less a discourtesy to Edward than a reflection of his distrust of those who were then representing the English king's authority. Llywelyn's failure to meet his financial obligations under the treaty of Montgomery became a matter of concern even before Edward's accession. Late and piecemeal delivery of the sum due at the end of 1270 may point less to a refusal to pay as a matter of principle than to an inability to meet the required payments. There is some indication that Llywelyn's financial resources were inadequate to meet the demands made upon them, particularly the costs incurred by the needs of war, which included castle building at Dolforwyn and Ewloe. Evidence assembled after his death points to the severity of his rule over the communities of his patrimony of Gwynedd, upon whose resources he was very largely dependent. Complaints made by the bishop of St Asaph similarly suggest rigorous financial exaction on the part of the prince, and relations between them were strained. Both Canterbury and the papal court, particularly in the time of Gregory X, were made aware of the internal conflicts of the principality of Wales. The most threatening occurrence was a conspiracy on the part of Dafydd ap Gruffudd and Gruffudd ap Gwenwynwyn to kill the prince. During April 1274, in proceedings before the prince's council at Dolforwyn, Gruffudd ap Gwenwynwyn was convicted of infidelity. His lands were forfeited but were in large part promptly restored by the prince's grace, and it is not certain that Llywelyn at that stage knew the full extent of the conspiracy, unless he was anxious to avoid any open admission of the seriousness of the threat he had encountered. The full story may not have emerged until much later in the year when Owain, son of Gruffudd ap Gwenwynwyn, held as a hostage for his father's good faith, made a full confession. It was only then that Dafydd came to be questioned, but before proceedings were initiated against him both he and Gruffudd fled to England. Edward had by then returned to England, and his decision to give the fugitives refuge in his realm had far-reaching implications in Anglo-Welsh relations.<br>
<br>Llywelyn was invited to Edward's coronation in August 1274 but did not attend. Of more consequence would be his response to a summons to do homage to the king, a call to Shrewsbury by 2 December 1274. He was given only a month's notice and the date was then brought forward by a week before Edward, on account of an abscess, cancelled the arrangement at very short notice. His inability to fulfil the engagement, which leaves unresolved the question of Llywelyn's willingness to attend, certainly caused a fateful postponement. Within days full knowledge of the conspiracy had been revealed, and before the end of 1274 Edward had given the plotters the shelter of his realm and a base from which they harried the prince. Llywelyn thus received his second summons, to come to Chester by 22 August 1275, at a time of greatly increased tension. The Welsh chronicle records that Llywelyn refused to meet Edward because the king was maintaining the two fugitives who had conspired to kill him. Llywelyn was close by the frontier while Edward was at Chester, and messengers passed between them. But no meeting took place and, at Treuddyn on 11 September, Llywelyn made a statement of his position in a letter to Pope Gregory. The essential issue was Edward's decision to provide sanctuary for his two faithless vassals, linked with the fact that he was summoned to do homage at a place to which it was unsafe for him to go, among men who had plotted his death. He was prepared to come to a safe place, as long as the king abided by the terms of the treaty of 1267 and ensured that breaches of the truce were corrected. There would be three more summonses to do homage, but the issues that would lead to war in 1277 were, with one exception, already formulated: Llywelyn had failed to fulfil his duties to the king, and he had not met his obligations under the treaty of 1267; he made war in the marches to the damage of the king's realm. The remaining issue was Llywelyn's decision to marry <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19046/', "Eleanor de Montfort (d. 1282)")</script>. Negotiations, in which Welsh Dominicans played a key part, led to a marriage by proxy before Eleanor left the convent at Montargis for her voyage to Wales in December 1275. She sailed with her brother Amaury, but her ships were intercepted on the high seas, probably near the Isles of Scilly. Edward attributed the capture to divine providence, but it may have reflected the surveillance of the Montforts that Edward had initiated following the murder of Henry of Almain by Simon de Montfort's sons at Viterbo in 1271. In letters to the pope Edward emphasized the dangers that the marriage created for the security of England. There can be little doubt that Llywelyn arranged the marriage in the immediate aftermath of Edward's decision to receive the conspirators, and that he did so in retaliation against the king's action.<h2>
<a name="WarandthetreatyofAberconwy1277"></a>War and the treaty of Aberconwy, 1277</h2>Formal condemnation of Llywelyn was made by king and council on 11 November 1276 when Llywelyn's proposals were rejected. Archbishop Kilwardby, who had attempted to engage the prince in discussions during the summer, withheld sentence of excommunication to give Llywelyn an opportunity to make his submission to the king. Llywelyn is known to have presented further proposals on two occasions early in 1277, but to no effect. By the spring, excommunication had been pronounced, and military operations were set in train in the march and in Powys and Deheubarth, where Edward was able to wean the Welsh lords from their loyalty to Llywelyn. The king launched the main offensive against Gwynedd in late July, with the declared objective of appropriating the prince's entire patrimony and sharing its possession between Owain ap Gruffudd, Dafydd ap Gruffudd, and himself. The main royal army advanced to the Conwy and another force occupied Anglesey. Llywelyn, despite some defections from among the men of Gwynedd, prepared for a long siege. From September, however, the forces confronting the prince were gradually reduced and a settlement was negotiated. Edward made provision for Dafydd in Perfeddwlad, and at the beginning of November a document was drawn up by which Llywelyn acknowledged Dafydd's hereditary right in Gwynedd Uwch Conwy, while Edward declared his willingness to allow Llywelyn to hold the land for his lifetime. These key agreements were embodied in the treaty of Aberconwy on 9 November 1277. Llywelyn was allowed to retain the style prince of Wales, with the homage of five minor lords. His broader principality was destroyed without its mention in the treaty, and he ceded the Four Cantrefs. Owain ap Gruffudd was released from prison and given land in Ll&#375;n, and financial provision was made for Rhodri. Neither was accorded the concern shown for Dafydd, who would succeed to his share of the patrimony at Llywelyn's death. A fine of 50,000 marks by which Llywelyn secured the king's grace was immediately remitted, but the prince was held to his outstanding obligations under the terms of the treaty of Montgomery and his annual payment for Anglesey. Llywelyn swore fealty at Rhuddlan on 11 November. Before Christmas he went to London where he did homage and attended to matters of detail arising from the treaty. Edward and Llywelyn met again at Rhuddlan in September 1278, and final arrangements were made for the celebration of Llywelyn's marriage to Eleanor de Montfort at Worcester on 13 October. Edward gave the bride in marriage and provided the wedding feast.<h2>
<a name="Conflictoflawandrenewedwarfare"></a>Conflict of law and renewed warfare</h2>Early in 1278 Llywelyn initiated proceedings before royal justices to claim against Gruffudd ap Gwenwynwyn the cantref of Arwystli and part of Cyfeiliog, lands he had retained following the legal process against Gruffudd in 1274 and then ceded in war. Llywelyn, acting in accordance with the terms of the treaty of Aberconwy, which allowed for the use of Welsh or marcher law as appropriate, wished to proceed by Welsh law while Gruffudd preferred English law. After deliberations in council in 1279&#150;80 Edward indicated that actions arising in Wales would be determined in accordance with the practice of his predecessors. Though Llywelyn pressed for a clear indication of the king's intentions, and Archbishop Pecham offered a highly critical estimate of Welsh law, Edward refrained from any elaboration. Llywelyn appears to have sought a procedure by which the case would be resolved by the judgment of Welsh judges (<i>ynaid</i>, <i>iudices</i>). Unwilling to consent to a procedure which would in effect take judgment away from his justices, Edward was at the same time reluctant to expose himself to the political repercussions of an explicit rejection of Llywelyn's demands. Llywelyn had placed the king in a difficult dilemma, but it is by no means certain that he was using the proceedings over Arwystli as a pretext for renewed conflict. An agreement with Roger Mortimer on 9 October 1281, by which the old adversaries set aside their differences, does not suggest impending conflict but indicates Llywelyn's wish, in the event of a successful outcome of the Arwystli case, to accommodate Mortimer's claims to lands that bordered on the cantref. Edward's anger at Llywelyn's recent action in reopening the Arwystli case is suggested in November 1281 by his more clearly declared support for Gruffudd ap Gwenwynwyn, and a hardening of his attitude is at the same time indicated in his appointment of Reynold de Grey as justice of Chester, an office that carried responsibility for Perfeddwlad. Signs of greatly increased anxiety may be recognized in letters of Llywelyn and Eleanor early in 1282.<br>
<br>Renewed conflict, which broke out with Dafydd's attack on Hawarden Castle on Palm Sunday (22 March) 1282, is best understood, however, as the outcome of the grievances not of Llywelyn but of Dafydd, along with those of other princes, and the discontent of communities who had a vexed experience of royal administration in Perfeddwlad. In a statement to Pecham late in 1282 Llywelyn said that he had no knowledge of the intention of those who went to war. But, he told the archbishop, after reciting the suffering endured by his people, no one should marvel that he had given his consent to those who began the war. It is not certain that Llywelyn joined the resistance at an early date, and he may not have committed himself to the conflict for some weeks, possibly not before Eleanor died giving birth to their daughter, Gwenllian, on 19 June. Even so, the record of Pecham's intervention in November, designed to persuade Llywelyn to submit to the king's will, establishes the prince's unquestioned leadership of the forces in rebellion by then. He was already besieged in Snowdonia, with Anglesey and Perfeddwlad lost, and his position was desperate. But in written statements made in anticipation of Pecham's coming, Llywelyn provided a reasoned account of the considerations that had brought his people to war, and rejected the archbishop's pleas that he submit himself to the king's will. He supplied Pecham with a substantial dossier embodying his complaints and those of his fellow princes and several communities.<br>
<br>Pecham, who found the king unwilling to countenance these submissions, made his way into Snowdonia for discussions with Llywelyn, probably at the prince's court at Aber or in its environs. He returned to find Edward still bent upon securing an unconditional surrender and he could do no more than secure a statement of the proposals that the magnates would put to the king if Llywelyn were prepared to submit. Nothing would be conceded concerning Anglesey or Perfeddwlad; Llywelyn and his people would be treated mercifully and the prince would be offered honourable maintenance, in fact an earldom, in England. In rejecting the proposals Llywelyn referred to his distant predecessors the Trojan founders of Britain, and emphasized both his ancient inheritance and the status accorded him by the mediation of the papacy in 1267. He would not renounce his responsibility to his people and leave them exposed to the rule of a king in whom they had no confidence. Even as the archbishop conducted his discussions with the magnates upon his return from Llywelyn the English army in Anglesey made an unsuccessful attempt to force a crossing of the Menai Strait and, when the archbishop terminated his mediation with a vigorous denunciation of those in rebellion, preparations were made for a new offensive.<h2>
<a name="Llywelynsdeathanditsaftermath"></a>Llywelyn's death and its aftermath</h2>Llywelyn's decision to depart from Gwynedd and take an army to the march of Wales has left historians perplexed. Already besieged in his redoubt in Snowdonia there were, however, military reasons for a major diversion of his opponents' resources. But there is a possibility that Llywelyn was drawn to the march by subterfuge. The continuation of <span class="italic">Brut y tywysogyon</span> records, in a statement that precedes its account of Llywelyn's departure, that &#145;then there was effected the betrayal of Llywelyn in the belfry at Bangor by his own men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brut: Peniarth MS 20</span>, 120). The precise meaning of the statement is uncertain, but the circumstances in which he met his death strongly suggest that he was lured to Cilmeri, in the neighbourhood of Builth, by a ruse in which Edmund Mortimer played a key role. Llywelyn's movements were closely monitored by English field commanders, and there can be no doubt that securing his death was a prime object of their endeavours. The account of Walter of Guisborough, describing a battle in which the Welsh, defending a bridge, were attacked upon their flank by a force that had forced the river upstream, does not carry conviction. The Welsh chronicle and several English chronicles, among which that of the Premonstratensian house of Hagnaby is particularly informative, point to Llywelyn's coming at Mortimer's behest to take the homage of his men, and then a fierce and prolonged battle in which the prince was separated from his forces and killed. He died on 11 December 1282. A report by John Pecham, carrying an intriguing reference to a treasonable letter disguised by false names found on Llywelyn's person, strongly suggests conspiracy among the marcher barons.<br>
<br>Llywelyn was decapitated and his head was sent to Edward and displayed to his troops before it was taken to London and, crowned with ivy, placed upon a pole at the Tower. The statement in the chronicle of Bury St Edmunds that his body was buried in the Cistercian abbey of Cwm-hir is not corroborated by any other writer but, given Pecham's keen inquiry into the truth of a report to that effect, is probably correct. His daughter, Gwenllian, was removed to the Gilbertine nunnery at Sempringham where, made a nun against her will according to the Welsh chronicler, she spent her days. She died at the nunnery in 1337. After Llywelyn's death his brother Dafydd ap Gruffudd assumed the title &#145;prince of Wales and lord of Snowdon&#146;, and maintained the struggle until his capture in the summer of 1283. Llywelyn's triumphs were celebrated by the poets Dafydd Benfras and Llygad G&#373;r, and his death inspired elegies of great eloquence by Bleddyn Fardd and Gruffudd ab yr Ynad Coch. The text of the chronicle <span class="italic">Brenhinedd y Saesson</span> relates that after the death of Llywelyn &#145;all Wales was cast to the ground&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brut: Saeson</span>, 259). His death, and the virtual extinction in the war of 1282&#150;3 of the princely lineages, brought an era in the history of Wales to a close.<h2>
<a name="Historicalremembrance"></a>Historical remembrance</h2>Llywelyn ap Gruffudd was not to be accorded extensive historical remembrance in the centuries following his death. Although there are occasional allusions to him in the poetry of the later middle ages, the profound sense of loss expressed in the elegies was not to be sustained. Gwenllian was his only child and consequently the prince left no lineage that might have stimulated the interest of the genealogists. More telling still was the fact that, with the extinction of the princes at the conquest, the historical writing represented by <span class="italic">Brut y tywysogyon</span> came to an end. Thereafter it was Geoffrey of Monmouth's <span class="italic">History of the Kings of Britain</span> that prevailed in the nation's awareness, and the distant figures of legendary history tended to excite greater interest than the historical persons of a more recent past. The work of Humphrey Llwyd and David Powel in the sixteenth century ensured that the memory of the princes was restored, and these scholars were the founders of a new tradition in Welsh historical writing. Their work, which accorded an appropriate place to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd's achievement, greatly influenced later writers, but in the eighteenth century Theophilus Evans and William Williams of Llandyg&aacute;i still expressed their regret that the princes were not better remembered. Fuller historical discussion came with the work of William Warrington in English, and Thomas Price and Gweirydd ap Rhys in Welsh; Llywelyn was also commemorated in epic poetry and in patriotic verse set to music. Even so, he was never to share the fame enjoyed by Owain Glyn D&#373;r, and efforts to raise by public subscription a memorial at Cilmeri, close by the place where he fell, came to nothing. An obelisk was eventually raised by the generosity of an Englishman, Stanley Bligh, squire of a neighbouring estate.<br>
<br>Authoritative discussion came with the publication of J. E. Lloyd's <span class="italic">History of Wales</span> (1911), but the descriptive nature of the work meant that Llywelyn's achievement in realigning the princes' allegiance so as to create a new political unity in Wales, and his unique success in establishing a relationship with the crown of England which reflected that change, remained largely unexplained. Moreover, the fact that Lloyd's narrative was in effect cut short at 1277 deprived his work of the advantage of being derived from the evidence relating both to the subsequent disputes over Welsh law, and to the considerations that led to renewed conflict in 1282, sources that contribute quite significantly to a study of the manner in which Welsh national identity was given political expression in this period. Modern historical investigation owes a great deal to the discussion embodied in the introduction by J. G. Edwards to <span class="italic">Littere Wallie</span> (1940), in which Llywelyn's activities were regarded as an attempt to overcome the problems caused by the &#145;chronic decentralization&#146; characteristic of government in thirteenth-century Wales. The contractual relationships that Llywelyn established with the princes of Powys and Deheubarth were portrayed as a means of achieving a measure of coherence in Welsh political affairs never previously attained. Llywelyn's image as a warrior prince, so beloved by generations of historians, now receded as he emerged as an architect of the nation's political institutions, though a prince whose political judgement was still subject to close scrutiny.<br>
<br>A subsequent broadening of the range of studies of thirteenth-century Wales, with attention given to law texts and poetry, military organization and castle building, the economy of the prince's dominion and his relations with those whom he ruled, has led to a sharpened historical awareness both of the extent of the change in Welsh politics and society, and of the predicament in which Llywelyn found himself in his relations not only with his royal and marcher opponents but also with the princes and communities of his own nation. The exultation and denunciation characteristic of earlier interpretations have by now been moderated in favour of a critical assessment of his efforts to bring a cohesive influence to bear upon a highly fractionized country, and of his ability, albeit for a brief period, to comprehend the territories under Welsh lordship in the unifying political structure represented by the principality of Wales.<br>
