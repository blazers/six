<span class="headword">Cardew,  (Brian) Cornelius McDonough</span>  (1936&#150;1981), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 7 May 1936 at 413 The Pottery, Greet, near Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, the second of three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30897/', "Michael Ambrose Cardew (1901&#150;1983)")</script> and his wife, Mariel Russell. Both his parents worked in the arts and crafts: his mother was an artist and his father was a master potter. After the family moved from Gloucestershire to Cornwall, Cardew attended the Canterbury Cathedral choir school, where he had music lessons and sang as a chorister between 1943 and 1950, and was a pupil at King's School, Canterbury, from 1950 to 1953. He entered the Royal Academy of Music, London, in 1953, and studied with Howard Ferguson (composition) and Percy Waller (piano). In 1957 he left the academy, played the guitar in the first British performance of Boulez's <span class="italic">Le marteau sans ma&icirc;tre</span>, and won a scholarship to attend Karlheinz Stockhausen's electronic music studio in Cologne. After impressing Stockhausen with his outstanding musicianship, his abilities as a pianist, and his skills as an improviser, Cardew acted as his assistant between 1958 and 1960, and later collaborated on the composition of <span class="italic">Carr&eacute;</span>. He was married, but the name of his wife is not known.<br>
<br>Cardew returned to Britain in 1961. There he organized concerts devoted to experimental music and undertook a course in graphic design, a skill that he practised intermittently until his death. But composition was his passion, and the music that he wrote in the late 1950s already showed talent and potential. While the Second Viennese School influenced some of his early works, the ideas of John Cage and David Tudor dominated his approach from 1959. In <span class="italic">February Pieces</span> for piano (1959&#150;61), <span class="italic">Autumn '60</span> (1960), and <span class="italic">Octet '61</span> (1961), he applied their principles and created material that could be arranged variously by performers. <span class="italic">Treatise</span> (1963&#150;7) also is an aleatoric work. Influenced by the philosophy of Frege and Wittgenstein, it juxtaposes graphic symbols with some standard music notation, a technique that encouraged some commentators to describe the score as a piece of abstract visual art. In 1964 the Italian government awarded Cardew a bursary to study with Goffredo Petrassi in Rome, and in 1966 he became involved with the free improvisation group AMM. The group's musicians responded freely to each other in performance and developed their ideas according to each other's needs and responses. Along with conventional instruments, which they used in unorthodox ways, they also experimented with portable radios and electronic amplification equipment. Cardew continued to perform with AMM until 1972.<br>
<br>The late 1960s was a busy period for Cardew: in 1966 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Academy of Music; in 1967 he was appointed professor of composition at the academy; between 1966 and 1971 he worked at Morley College, London, teaching experimental music; and in 1968 he composed &#145;Paragraph 1&#146; of <span class="italic">The Great Learning</span>. Drawing upon Ezra Pound's translations of Confucius, the work uses a mixture of graphic notation, musical symbols, and verbal instructions. It was performed for the first time at the Cheltenham Festival in 1968, and over the next two years Cardew completed six more <span class="roman">Paragraphs</span>. As a direct result of his work at Morley College he became a founder member of the Scratch Orchestra in 1969. A confirmed socialist, he applied his political principles when managing and directing the orchestra. The group was an amalgam of professional and amateur musicians whose reputation for innovative programmes spread quickly. It performed extensively in Britain and abroad and was invited to perform the new version of <span class="italic">The Great Learning</span> at the BBC Promenade Concerts in August 1972.<br>
<br>In 1971 Cardew repudiated <span class="italic">The Great Learning</span>, arguing that avant-garde music had failed to reach the masses. Influenced by the teachings of Mao Zedong, he began to compose music that was populist and politically didactic. In 1974 he famously attacked Stockhausen in <span class="italic">Stockhausen Serves Imperialism</span> (1974), and later he was involved in street protests against reactionary politics that culminated in arrest and imprisonment. After a North American tour early in 1975 he became involved with the Progressive Cultural Association, and in 1979 he was a founder member of the Revolutionary Communist Party of Britain. Two years later he composed his last work: <span class="italic">Boolavogue</span>, for two pianos.<br>
<br>Cardew's apologists have argued that he was a leading figure in late twentieth-century music, and that performers and administrators have largely ignored his works. But recordings of his compositions have been made, and his articles and books are readily available. That said, his works are performed rarely, and he no longer holds the iconic status that he enjoyed during the 1960s and the 1970s; his ideas and music have become an anachronism. He was the product of an age that believed passionately in ideas and their execution. He never compromised his beliefs and, as Kurt Schwertsik noted poignantly in 1982, &#145;He never tried &hellip; to reconcile the demands of &#147;The New&#148; with the desire to change them; he just wasn't concerned to please respected authorities as well as pleasing, and being, himself. He was free.&#146; Cornelius Cardew was the victim of a hit-and-run road accident on 19 December 1981 and was dead on arrival at Whipps Cross Hospital, London.<br>
