<span class="headword">Russell,  Edward Southwell</span>, twenty-sixth Baron de Clifford  (1907&#150;1982), <span class="occ">racing driver, dog-food salesman, and the last peer to be tried by the House of Lords</span>, was born on 31 January 1907, the only son of Jack Southwell Russell, twenty-fifth Baron de Clifford (1884&#150;1909), an Irish landowner, and his wife, Evelyn Victoria Anne (<i>b</i>. 1886/7), a Gibson girl whose stage name was Eva Carrington; she was the daughter of Walter Robert Chandler of Dalgan Park, Shrule, Tuam, sometime orderly room clerk to Colonel Fred Burnaby. In infancy Russell succeeded to the title and an impoverished Irish estate (12,000 acres in co. Mayo and co. Galway, worth &pound;5691 a year in 1883 but valued at &pound;100,000 in 1909) when his father was killed in a motor accident at Bramber, Sussex, on 1 September 1909. He was educated at Eton College and Imperial College, London, where he studied engineering. His early years were associated with fast cars and fast women. On 11 March 1926, aged nineteen, he married Dorothy (Dolly) Evelyn Meyrick (1902&#150;1987), dance hostess daughter of the shady nightclub manageress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66827/', "Kate Meyrick")</script>, and was promptly fined &pound;50 for making a false oath to obtain the marriage certificate, claiming that he was aged twenty-two and the son of Jack Russell, engineer; he feared that his mother, who was his legal guardian and by then on her third husband, George Vernon Tate, might have withheld her consent. He was lucky, the lord mayor stated, in imposing the fine, to have escaped a prison sentence.<br>
<br>Nine years later de Clifford was luckier still to escape prison. On 21 August 1935 he was charged with &#145;feloniously killing and slaying Douglas George Hopkins by driving a motor recklessly at the Kingston Bypass road&#146;; he stated that the other car, driven by Hopkins, another racing driver, returning at 3.30 a.m. from a dance in Datchet with his sister and girlfriend, had been out of control, on the wrong side of the road, and going at a tremendous speed, so that he, de Clifford, had swerved to avoid it and thus also ended up on the wrong side of the road. This was not considered a convincing defence. A peer&#151;and indeed any peeress, whether noble by birth or by marriage&#151;accused of felony had to be tried by his peers&#151;a privilege, or procedure, that could not be waived. These trials had become exceedingly rare so that the first action of the House of Lords was to set up a select committee to scrutinize the precedents and establish the proper form for turning itself into a court, which it drew from the last trial, that of the second Earl Russell for bigamy, in 1901.<br>
<br>The Russell trial had been a big social occasion, with much demand for ringside seats; again, in 1935 admission to de Clifford's trial was by ticket only, issued to privileged categories of peers electing not to take a full part in the trial, peeresses, eldest sons of peers, Scottish and Irish peers, and a limited number of MPs. While there was a full house on 12 December 1935 it was not, however, treated as a second Ascot, unlike the 1901 event, which had chanced to fall in July. There was some preliminary debate on whether it was obligatory for peers to wear cocked hats, and on the definition of a cocked hat; it was decided that all peers wishing to be full members of the trial had to be properly dressed and hatted, but ordinary spectators could be less formally dressed. After this considerable build-up the trial itself, while quite spectacular as pageant, was very brief. Sir Henry Curtis Bennett KC advanced the extraordinary argument that de Clifford had no case to answer, since the mere fact that a motorist was on the wrong side of the road, as he admitted he had been, was no evidence of negligence, let alone of criminal negligence. The trial peers listened to this in the royal gallery (fitted out as a court), trooped out to their chamber to debate it, and returned to the court to pronounce in turn, starting with the most junior baron, that de Clifford was not guilty. The charge against him of dangerous driving still stood, in theory to be heard in the ordinary courts; but it was quietly dropped and no further charges were pursued.<br>
<br>These occasional trials by peers tended to produce theatrical performances of a carefully choreographed and half-remembered costume drama&#151;Dorothy Sayers, no doubt inspired by accounts of the Russell trial, gave a graphic description of a fictitious trial by peers in her <span class="italic">Clouds of Witness</span> (1926)&#151;and bizarre verdicts. The de Clifford acquittal was in the tradition of the perverse conviction of Earl Russell for bigamy (he spent three months in Holloway prison) on the grounds that his divorce from his outrageously impossible first wife, perfectly validly performed at Reno, Nevada, was not recognized under English law, and of the even more outrageous acquittal of Lord Cardigan in 1841, because the evidence that he shot Harvey Tuckett in a duel did not prove that he had shot the Harvey Garnet Phipps Tuckett named in the indictment. The lord chancellor in 1935, Hailsham, praised the trial as a fine example of maintaining a glorious tradition, while at the same time acknowledging that the whole archaic ritual was an anachronistic and inherently unfair procedure. Nothing was done about it, however, until after 1945, when a section of the law reforms in the 1948 <span class="roman">Criminal Justice Act</span> abolished trial by peers.<br>
<br>For de Clifford the publicity of his trial and the curious basis of his acquittal meant his withdrawal from public life. He perhaps appreciated the irony that he had begun to build a reputation as a road safety expert in the Lords from his maiden speech, at the age of twenty-one, proposing driving tests for all applicants for driving licences and&#151;years before its time&#151;suggesting that road deaths and injuries of children could be curbed by having policemen outside schools to help them in crossing roads. In the early 1930s, between visits to Brooklands racetrack, he maintained a steady stream of short speeches on road safety, pressing for the introduction of driving tests because it was &#145;unfair that the majority of motorists should be penalised for the minority of careless drivers&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 June 1932) and welcoming speed limits in built-up areas, urging that &#145;there were places in larger towns where even 30 miles an hour would be too great&#146;  (ibid., 11 July 1934). He gave this up after 1935 and never spoke in the Lords again. He also gave up racing, using his engineering training with armoured cars in the Territorial Army and then with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) during the Second World War; he transferred to the regular army in 1942, was appointed OBE (military) in 1955, and retired as lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>De Clifford's marriage survived his appearance as co-respondent in a divorce case in 1936 but he and his wife separated after the war and were finally divorced in 1973; on 4 December 1974 he married Mina Margaret, only daughter of George Edward Sands. For a while he lived in Wrantage, near Taunton, Somerset, running a quarantine kennel and selling dog food door-to-door, and then moved to The Birches, Silvington, Cleobury Mortimer, Shropshire, where he died on 3 January 1982, leaving &pound;437. He was survived by his second wife, and was succeeded in the title by his elder son, John Edward Southwell Russell, who was born in 1928.<br>
