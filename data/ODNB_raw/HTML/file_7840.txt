<span class="headword">Dormer,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1650, <em>d.</em> 1726), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was baptized on 30 May 1650, the second son of John Dormer (<i>bap</i>. 1612, <i>d</i>. 1679), of Lee Grange, Quainton, Buckinghamshire, barrister and MP, and his wife, Katharine (<i>bap</i>. 1622, <i>d</i>. 1691), daughter of Thomas Woodward of Saxons Lode, Ripple, Worcestershire. Dormer matriculated on 30 April 1667 at Christ Church, Oxford, and then on 20 May 1669 entered Lincoln's Inn. He was called to the bar on 27 January 1676 and soon afterwards became attorney-general to Bishop Crew of Durham. As early as 1680 Dormer acted as junior counsel for the crown in the prosecution of Sir Thomas Gascoigne for treason and Elizabeth Cellier for libel. By 1690 he was appearing as counsel before the House of Lords. At some point before 1693 Dormer married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1729), daughter and coheir of Sir Richard Blake of London. They had two sons and five daughters, but only three daughters survived them. In March 1693 Dormer petitioned (as heir) the crown for a grant of the estate of his nephew, Sir William Dormer, second baronet (the son of his elder brother, John), who had inherited the family estates in 1675, in order to pay off the encumbrances on the estate, with William, a lunatic, being left in the care of Sir Fleetwood Dormer of Arle Court, Gloucestershire. In November 1693 Dormer was appointed chancellor of the diocese of Durham, a post which he held until 1696.<br>
<br>In September 1696 Dormer succeeded to his uncle's estate at Arle Court, and, if he had not already done so, gained control of his nephew's estates. In February 1698 Dormer acted as counsel for the parliamentary bill of pains and penalties against Charles Duncombe. Dormer stood for Aylesbury at the 1698 general election, but was defeated. When the election was declared void he won the subsequent by-election in February 1699. During this parliament Dormer appears to have switched sides from tory to whig and come under the influence of the leading Buckinghamshire whig Thomas, fourth Baron Wharton. He certainly proved able to defend several whig ministers, including the duke of Shrewsbury and Lord Chancellor Somers, who were under attack in December 1699 over the patent issued to Captain Kidd, who had by then turned pirate, arguing &#145;very strongly for the legality of the grant&#146;  (James, 2.380). By December 1700 he was being described as &#145;wholly Lord Wharton's&#146;  (Verney MS 636/51, Lord Cheyne to Sir John Verney, 14 Dec 1700). He stood for the county of Buckinghamshire at the January 1701 election, but lost, winning the seat at the general election held the following December. A man of &#145;soaring temper&#146;  (Verney, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.159&#150;60), his ambition may well have been to become lord keeper, but the king's death prevented his advancement and he then lost his seat in 1702, taking refuge at Northallerton at a by-election held in November. No doubt his local knowledge assisted the whig side in the celebrated <i>Ashby v. White</i> case concerning the election at Aylesbury when he argued on 21 January 1704 that voters deprived of the franchise should have recourse to the law courts and thus against the exclusive jurisdiction of the House of Commons over elections. He was returned for Buckinghamshire in 1705, vacating his seat upon becoming a judge on 11 February 1706.<br>
<br>Lady Gardiner had noted that Dormer's &#145;generous humour has made him many friends&#146;  (Verney MS 636/52, 30 July 1702) and in celebration of his elevation to the court of common pleas &#145;most of the Lord (Spiritual and Temporal) were invited to dine with the new judge, Mr Justice Dormer, whose Serjeant's motto, given by the Bishop of Sarum, is <i>Imperium Oceano, Faman Astris</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Diaries of William Nicolson</span>, 375). Dormer's admittance to the order of serjeants-at-law was sponsored by the two leading ministers, the duke of Marlborough and Lord Treasurer Godolphin.<br>
<br>Dormer was reappointed to common pleas following the accession of George I and continued to grace the bench until his death. In March 1726 Dormer had succeeded his nephew to the family properties at Lee and also Purston, Northamptonshire. Dormer made his will on 15 July 1726, three days after the burial of his only surviving son, Fleetwood. Dormer died at his house in Lincoln's Inn Fields on 18 September 1726 and was buried at Quainton, where a full-sized effigy of him was set up.<br>
