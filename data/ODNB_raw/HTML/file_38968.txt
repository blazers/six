<span class="headword">Walton,  George Henry</span>  (1867&#150;1933), <span class="occ">designer and architect</span>, was born on 3 June 1867 at 58 Buccleuch Street, Glasgow, the youngest of the twelve children of Jackson Walton (<i>c</i>.1808&#150;1873) and his second wife, Eliza Anne Nicholson (1826&#150;1902), daughter of Thomas Balfour Nicholson and his wife, Hughina. His parents were both Scottish. Son of a wealthy cotton importer, Walton's father inherited a flourishing commission agency in 1838, which subsequently foundered. Later, he made a number of unsuccessful excursions into manufacturing while his fortune dwindled. At home he was a keen amateur painter and photographer. He died in 1873, when George was six, leaving the family with limited means. The family was close, however, and Walton's childhood was not unhappy.<br>
<br>Walton was educated at Sutherlands School, Hillhead, from 1874 to 1876 and at Partick Academy from about 1876 to 1881. At fourteen he was obliged to start work, and found employment at the British linen bank, Glasgow. At home he was surrounded by artists: his sisters Helen and Hannah taught painting and decorated china and glass, while Constance excelled in watercolours. His brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38954/', "Edward Arthur Walton (1860&#150;1922)")</script> was a leading member of the painting group the Glasgow Boys, and a friend of the artist James McNeill Whistler; George often accompanied him on painting trips. Before 1888, when he abandoned finance to start his career as a decorator, he had attended classes at the Glasgow Atelier Fine Arts (1887&#150;9) and the Glasgow School of Art. Walton launched his new company, George Walton &amp; Co., ecclesiastical and house decorators, of 152 Wellington Street, Glasgow, on the strength of a commission from Catherine Cranston. His work at her 114 Argyle Street tea-room included stencil designs in a style influenced by William Morris. Over the next few years Walton's workshops took on glass staining, picture-frame making, cabinet-making, and metalwork. Commissions included the decoration of a church, several residential and shop interiors, and a large stained-glass window for the shipowner William Burrell. Walton married Kate Gall on 3 June 1891; their only daughter, Marguerite, was born the following year.<br>
<br>By the mid-1890s the reputation of Walton's company was spreading further afield. A large redecoration job was completed at Drumalis, Larne, Northern Ireland (1893), and the company's first Yorkshire job was carried out in Scarborough for the Rowntree family in 1896. An office was opened in York in 1898. Elm Bank, York, now a hotel, has the largest collection of surviving decorative work in the area. In Glasgow, Walton decorated and furnished 91&#150;3 Buchanan Street (1896&#150;7) for Miss Cranston. This and the refurbishment of the 114 Argyle Street tea-room (1899), on which he had worked at the outset of his career, were shared with the young architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Walton's style of work was distinctive: his simplification of form and pattern parallels the work of the English designer C. F. A. Voysey&#151;a lifelong friend&#151;while the decorative details and colour schemes show the influence of Whistler and the Glasgow Boys. Elongation of uprights, extension of cornice mouldings, and the inclusion of beaten copper and leaded glass panels characterize his work, which was an early influence on the development of the Glasgow style&#151;a Scottish response to the English arts and crafts movement.<br>
<br>In 1896 George Walton &amp; Co. became a limited company. Continuing as managing director, Walton moved to London the following year. Through the Glaswegian photographer James Craig Annan he met J. B. B. Wellington and George Davison, members of the Linked Ring photographic society. Davison, working for the Eastman Photographic Company (later Kodak Ltd), commissioned Walton to design a series of shops, including sites in Brussels, Milan, Vienna, and Moscow, which contributed to a growing interest in his work on the continent. Walton had gained credibility as an architect and Wellington commissioned him to design a house in 1901: The Leys, Elstree, a very individual building in the arts and crafts tradition, was decorated and furnished throughout by Walton.<br>
<br>Living from 1901 at 44 Holland Street, Walton concentrated on his London-based practice. In 1903 he resigned the directorship of George Walton &amp; Co., which closed in 1905. Davison became Walton's major client, commissioning a houseboat (1902&#150;3), two completely furnished residences&#151;the White House, Shiplake (1908), and Wern Fawr, Harlech (<i>c</i>.1908&#150;11)&#151;and the St David's Hotel, Harlech (1909&#150;10). These buildings show the inspiration of Georgian architecture. Other notable projects of this period were St John's, Ryde, Isle of Wight, and the interiors of Alma House, Cheltenham. Walton was elected a licentiate member of the RIBA in 1911. During the First World War he worked with Harry Redfern and C. F. A. Voysey for the central control board (liquor traffic). His first wife having died, he met his second wife, Dorothy Anne Jeram (<i>b</i>. 1889/90), at the board; they were married on 20 August 1918 and a son, Edward, was born in 1920.<br>
<br>After the war, when building work was scarce, Walton was supported by commissions from old friends&#151;Wellington, Davison, and James Morton, a Scottish textile manufacturer; he nevertheless suffered increasing financial difficulty. His later work included an addition to The Leys, the chapel of St George, Cap d'Antibes, stained glass, and textile designs. Walton was reserved in his manner but warm and loyal in his friendships. He died on 10 December 1933 at home at 70 Seabrook Road, Hythe, and was buried on 13 December at Marylebone cemetery, East Finchley. His second wife survived him. In 1933, when the <span class="italic">Architectural Review</span> was planning an exhibition on architects of Walton's generation, Nikolaus Pevsner and John Betjeman hailed Walton as a pioneer of the Modern Movement. Thomas Howarth's 1952 monograph on Mackintosh also drew attention to Walton and in 1993 Glasgow museums mounted a major exhibition of his work. His designs and other works are held by the George Walton archive, a private collection, the Glasgow museums and art galleries, and the RIBA drawings collection; photographs of his work for Kodak are to be found in the National Museum of Photography, Film, and Television, at Bradford.<br>
