<span class="headword">Lawrence,  Esther Ella</span>  (1862&#150;1944), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born in 1862 in New York, the second daughter and third of the nine children of John M. Lawrence (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1827), a merchant, and his wife, Emily (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1833). Her father was English and her mother came from Spanish Town, Jamaica. The family moved from New York to London while Esther was a child and settled at 37 Belsize Lane, St John's Wood. From 1878 to 1880 she attended South Hampstead high school, which was strongly supported by the Jewish community to which she belonged. In 1880 she entered Bedford College, London, at the beginning of the Michaelmas term and remained for two terms, studying mathematics, English literature, French, German, Latin, and botany.<br>
<br>Esther Lawrence continued her studies in 1881 at the Tavistock Place Training College, opened under the auspices of the Froebel Society in 1879, where she trained as a kindergarten teacher and gained a second-class certificate in 1883. The principal at this point in the college's short-lived history was Penelope Lawrence, who became headmistress of Roedean School in 1885. After completing her studies Esther opened a kindergarten in Gower Street, London. In 1884 she was invited to take charge of the preparatory department of the Chiswick high school by the headmistress, Alice Woods, who was herself a keen Froebelian; this collaboration initiated a friendship which lasted until Woods's death in 1941.<br>
<br>Esther Lawrence left Chiswick high school in 1893 to take up the post of kindergarten mistress of the kindergarten and transition classes held at Glazbury Road, West Kensington, in conjunction with the Froebel Training School of Primary Instruction run by Emilie Michaelis in Norland Place, Notting Hill. This school became the Froebel Educational Institute in 1894 and the classes formed the Colet Gardens demonstration school, moving to a wing of the new institute buildings in 1895. The institute was founded after extensive fund-raising efforts by Julia Salis Schwabe, who persuaded Sir William Mather to become chairman with Claude Goldsmid Montefiore as the first treasurer. The link between these figures was the Froebel Society and, in the case of Esther Lawrence and Claude Montefiore, their shared adherence to the liberal wing of British Judaism. Froebel's spiritual view of education and his belief in the unity of God, man, and the natural world held a particular appeal for her.<br>
<br>After serving for four years as head of the demonstration school Esther Lawrence resigned and went to visit Adele du Portugall, head of the Froebel Institute in Naples. When she returned to England in 1899 she was appointed mistress of method in the institute. On the retirement of Emilie Michaelis in 1901, Esther succeeded her as principal and remained in this post until her own retirement thirty years later in 1931. During this long period of office the institute underwent great change, moving from the increasingly cramped Talgarth Road site to the spacious grounds at Grove House, Roehampton, where it developed as a residential college and the training was extended to three years.<br>
<br>Esther Lawrence set out her educational ideas in a number of articles, notably &#145;The application of Froebel's principles&#146; (<span class="italic">Child Life</span>, 6/23, 1904, 136&#150;41) and &#145;The training of Froebelian teachers&#146; (<span class="italic">Child Life</span>, 7/27, 1905, 128&#150;37), and in her powerful address to the Froebel Society in 1914, &#145;Nations and nurseries&#146; (<span class="italic">Child Life</span>, 16/91, suppl., 1914, 1&#150;16). She made her own contribution to Froebelian practice in <span class="italic">The Circular Tablet: a Connecting Link in the Froebel Series of Gifts</span> (1896). Her cousin Samuel Alexander was reported to be so impressed with the book's mathematical conceptions that he read part of it to his philosophy class at Manchester University  (Jebb, 2). In her presidential address to the Froebel Society in 1926, &#145;The education of the spirit&#146;, she argued that<blockquote>A child considers that he is the centre of the universe, and so, indeed, he is. From the place where he stands in time and space he has the power, crude and undeveloped, of viewing the whole of life &hellip; We often say, &#145;I must put that child in his place,&#146; meaning that we must suppress him. But if we put him <i>properly in</i>, or into, his place, we should make him feel the importance and the responsibility of the place which is actually his, and no other's. (<span class="italic">Child Life</span>, 1927, 49)</blockquote>Her affection for and friendship with children was described as the key to much of her life: &#145;there was a natural affinity between them, and intuitive understanding, a close sympathy with the mistakes, experiments and efforts of immaturity, a secret bond with the rebel&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Link</span>, 1945, 13).<br>
<br>As a member and later president of the Froebel Society, Esther Lawrence sought to make a Froebelian education available to all children. Hitherto kindergarten education had been the province of the middle class but she was deeply concerned for slum children whose squalid lives held little prospect of joy, with a stunted capacity for physical, creative, and intellectual growth. She was responsible for opening nursery schools in two of the most deprived areas of London, the Michaelis Free Kindergarten in Notting Dale (1908) and the Somers Town nursery school, Crowndale Road, St Pancras (1910). Both schools were supported by students of the Froebel Institute and the Michaelis Guild and, as well as education, offered health care and activities for parents. Lawrence encouraged mothers in these areas of London, many of them initially unwilling and suspicious, to send their children to the schools. They and others like them in London and Edinburgh, &#145;were the first example of separate free nursery schools in Britain&#146;  (Whitbread, 56).<br>
<br>Esther Lawrence gave many gifts to the Froebel Educational Institute over the years, most notably the Lawrence family's country home, Hill House, at Inworth, Kelvedon, Essex, given in trust to the Froebel Institute in 1944 for educational or social welfare use. The house was subsequently administered by the Save the Children Fund, in which she had been interested since its foundation in 1919. The Esther Lawrence Association, originally formed in 1939 to manage the assets of Somers Town nursery school during its evacuation, and the Esther Lawrence Research Fellowship Fund, established in 1948, provided a continuing focus for the work which she held to be so important.<br>
<br>A wealth of reminiscences attest Esther Lawrence's inspiration of a wide range of people&#151;colleagues, students, parents, and the children to whom she dedicated her life's work. On her retirement from the Froebel Educational Institute in 1931 Michael Sadler, a colleague and friend of many years, and Maude Royden were among those who paid tribute to her work. To mark her retirement the Lawrence scholarship was established in 1932. After her death students who had studied at Froebel during her long principalship, wrote of her spiritual as well as intellectual vision for the college, and of her power to draw out the best in those around her  (<span class="italic">The Link</span>, 1945, 20&#150;21). She died, unmarried, on 23 July 1944 at 43 Park Road, Radlett, Aldenham, Hertfordshire, after a short illness.<br>
