<span class="headword">Hodgson,  John</span>  (1617/18&#150;1684?), <span class="occ">army officer and autobiographer</span>, was a native of Yorkshire. He took up arms for parliament in late 1642 and began his military service as ensign in the regiment of Colonel Forbes. He fought under Sir Thomas Fairfax and was badly wounded in the defeat at Sancroft Moor. When the marquess of Newcastle captured Bradford (July 1643) he was made prisoner and stripped, but, being released, made his way to Rochdale, where he suffered a fever. He rejoined Fairfax at Knutsford Heath, to undertake the attack on Lord Byron at Nantwich (January 1644). His company then entered Colonel John Bright's regiment, and he took part in the 1645 siege of Pontefract.<br>
<br>On 17 April 1646 he married a woman surnamed Stancliffe; they had two sons, Timothy and Eleazer, and three daughters, Sarah, Martha, and Lydia. In the summer of 1647, as tension mounted between parliament and its armies, Hodgson was prominent in securing the alignment of the northern association army with the New Model. With Major Henry Lilburne he led troops through Leeds to a rendezvous on the moors. Papers were read concerning the New Model's desire to co-operate with their northern comrades, agitators were chosen, including Hodgson, a general rendezvous was demanded, and Poyntz, the commander of the northern forces, was arrested. Hodgson feared dismissal because of his actions, and appears to have remained in the army due to the protection of John Lambert, the future major-general.<br>
<br>Hodgson fought in the battle of Preston (August 1648) as a lieutenant in Captain Spencer's company, leading the &#145;forlorn of foot&#146; with Major Pownall. When Cromwell invaded Scotland in 1650, Hodgson, whose regiment was now commanded by Lambert, took part in the campaign. His description of the battle of Dunbar is perhaps the most valuable part of his autobiography. After Dunbar he was given command of a company in Cromwell's regiment of foot, sent into Lancashire to assist Colonel Lilburne against the earl of Derby. Though he did not arrive until after Derby's defeat, his regiment helped to intercept the Scots after Worcester, and took part in the capture of the Isle of Man (1651).<br>
<br>When Lambert was appointed lord deputy of Ireland, Hodgson wrote of his desire to follow his commander. After Cromwell became protector, Hodgson wished to leave the army &#145;to live quietly in the practice of my calling&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 21422, fol. 374) but was appointed lieutenant in Lambert's regiment of horse, quartered in Yorkshire, to enable him to be near his family. On 11 April 1657 he acquired Coley Hall, near Halifax, by lease for fifteen years. He acted as an army surgeon, although he lacked official medical qualifications; he would later be indicted for practising medicine without a medical degree despite his eleven years as an army doctor.<br>
<br>On Saturday 28 May 1659, when the restored Rump Parliament agreed the officer list for Lambert's regiment, Hodgson was &#145;excepted&#146; and appears to have lost his place until he received a new commission from the speaker on 3 August. In October 1659, following the army coup, he was assigned to the regiment of Colonel Saunders, and ordered to join George Monck's army in Scotland. Monck declared against the army regime, but Hodgson would not fight against Lambert and with Captain Roger Coates sought to raise money for his old commander. By now he had given evidence of Quaker opinions. In response to the crisis of 1659 he appears to have written two Quaker pamphlets, <span class="italic">A Letter from a Member of the Army</span> and <span class="italic">Love, Kindness, and due Respect</span>, warning of men turning away from the Lord and serving themselves. A John Hodgson also signed <span class="italic">A Declaration of the People of God in Scorn called Quakers</span> (1659) protesting against the expulsion of Friends from civil and military positions. He was on close terms with the Quaker officers captains William Siddall, Amor Stoddard, and John Leavens.<br>
<br>When Monck marched into England, Hodgson's prospects of further employment ended and, after the Restoration, he was the object of government suspicion. He was listed among those from the West Riding imprisoned in 1660 for not taking the oath of allegiance, and a meeting of &#145;a hundred fanatics, ministers, and others&#146; was reported as held on 3 July 1660 at Coley Hall. Hodgson, referred to as a &#145;great Phanatique&#146;, spent five months in York Castle for treasonable words spoken against Charles II. In July 1661 he narrowly escaped arrest at Adderton fair, but suffered arrest again, being suspected of involvement in radical plots. In 1663 he was found guilty of misprision of treason, for not revealing knowledge of the northern rising, but seems to have eventually secured a pardon by bribery. He was rearrested, on suspicion of continued involvement in planned disturbances, in August 1665.<br>
<br>By now Hodgson had moved from Coley Hall to Cromwell Bottom, moving thence to Ripon in 1680. He is probably the John Hodgson mentioned by Oliver Heywood as dying impoverished at Ripon on 24 January 1684 aged sixty-six. The last date in his diary is 11 January 1684. His &#145;Memoirs&#146;, first published with Sir Henry Slingsby's &#145;Original memoirs&#146; in 1806, appear in part to have been written in response to the persecution he received after the Restoration, although they contain much of interest with regard to his military experiences. He avoids commenting on his political and religious views, though it seems clear that he was not as innocent after 1660 as he makes out.<br>
