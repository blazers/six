<span class="headword">Oliver,  Martha Cranmer <span class="st"> [Pattie]</span></span>  (1834&#150;1880), <span class="occ">actress</span>, the daughter of John Oliver, a scene painter, was born at Salisbury, and appeared on the stage there when she was only six years old. Here and at Southampton her performances of children's parts attracted attention. In 1847 she made her London d&eacute;but under Mary Warner's management at the Marylebone Theatre. Madame Vestris then employed her at the Lyceum from 1849 to 1855. In 1855 she went to Drury Lane, where on 10 October she played Matilda in <span class="italic">Married for Money</span> and on 4 September 1856 Celia in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>. Her performance as Helen in Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">The Hunchback</span> won such praise from the critics that J. B. Buckstone offered her an engagement at the Haymarket, where she was seen in Francis Talfourd's burlesque <span class="italic">Atalanta</span> on 14 April 1857. Having accepted an offer from Ada Swanborough, she became the leading actress in comedy and burlesque for several seasons at the Strand Theatre, where her parts included Amy Robsart in <span class="italic">Ye Queen, ye Earl, and ye Maiden</span> (December 1858), Pauline in H. J. Byron's burlesque <span class="italic">The Lady of Lyons</span> (June 1859), and the Prince in Byron's burlesque <span class="italic">Cinderella</span> (December 1860). On E. A. Sothern's first appearance as Lord Dundreary in London, at the Haymarket (16 November 1861), she played Mary Meredith in Tom Taylor's <span class="italic">Our American Cousin</span>. In April 1863 she took the title role in Byron's burlesque <span class="italic">Beautiful Haidee</span> at the Princess's.<br>
<br>Pattie Oliver became manager of the New Royalty Theatre on 31 March 1866 and opened with a revival of Taylor's <span class="italic">The Ticket-of-Leave Man</span> and Robert Reece's burlesque <span class="italic">Ulf the Minstrel</span>. In a clever and successful piece by H. T. Craven, entitled <span class="italic">Meg's Diversion</span>, which was produced on 17 October, she acted Meg, the author played Jasper Pidgeon, and F. Dewar took the part of Roland. On 29 November 1866 she put on the stage F. C. Burnand's burlesque <span class="italic">The Latest Edition of Black-Eyed Susan, or, The Little Bill that was Taken Up</span>. The piece failed to please the critics, but succeeded with audiences, and had an unprecedented run of some 400 performances; on its production at the Royalty on 23 September 1868, it was said that Pattie Oliver had sung <span class="italic">Pretty See-usan, Don't Say No</span> no fewer than 1775 times. During the run of this burlesque she produced as a first piece Andrew Halliday's drama <span class="italic">Daddy Gray</span> (February 1868), and on 26 November 1868 a serio-comic drama by the same author entitled <span class="italic">The Loving Cup</span>. Other burlesques were introduced with less success.<br>
<br>On 3 March 1870 <span class="italic">Black-Eyed Susan</span> was revived; the last night of Pattie Oliver's lesseeship was 30 April 1870 when the burlesque was given for the 490th time. After this period she was seldom seen on the stage. She married by licence at the register office, Marylebone, on 26 December 1876, William Charles Phillips, an auctioneer aged thirty-one, the son of the auctioneer William Phillips of Bond Street, London. She was a general favourite with the public, and gave liberal aid to the aged and unfortunate members of her profession. She died at her home, 5 Grove End Road, St John's Wood, London, on 20 December 1880.<br>
