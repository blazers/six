<span class="headword">Zepler,  Eric Ernest <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Erich Ernst]</span></span>  (1898&#150;1980), <span class="occ">electrical engineer and university teacher</span>, was born on 27 January 1898 in Herford, Westphalia, Germany, the younger son of Martin Zepler (1862&#150;1939), a country doctor, and his wife, Flora Guttfreund (1866&#150;1943). His Jewish parents converted to Christianity in 1902, and he was baptized in the Lutheran church, Herford, on 14 December 1902. He was educated at the Realgymnasium in Altena, Westphalia, and after studying physics at the universities of Bonn (1916&#150;19) and Berlin (1919&#150;20) took the DPhil degree at W&uuml;rzburg in 1922. His radio engineering work began with three colleagues in a small workshop in St Blasien. He joined Telefunken in Berlin in 1925 and became head of design for receivers and direction finders in 1932. By 1935 he had thirty-seven individual patents and twenty-two joint patents. On 2 October 1926 he married Eleonore Johanna Fischer (1899&#150;1990).<br>
<br>To escape Nazi persecution Zepler moved to England in 1935 with his wife and young children, Carole and Matthew, and continued his work on radio design at the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company in Chelmsford until 1940. During the Second World War airborne radio receivers and transmitters based on his designs were used by both the RAF and the Luftwaffe. Zepler's remarkable insight into radio circuits, and his analytical ability, enabled him to transform the design of radio systems from a black art of trial and error into a modern engineering discipline where the performance of equipment is determined before it is constructed. This pioneering work was encapsulated in his classic book <span class="italic">The Technique of Radio Design</span>, which was published in 1943. His analytical method of design was later applied to other electronic systems and thus made an important contribution to the flowering of electronic engineering during the next half-century.<br>
<br>After internment in 1940, Zepler became a lecturer in 1941 at the University College in Southampton, which became a university in 1952. He worked there for the rest of his career, except for three years from 1943, which he spent at Cambridge University. He became a naturalized British subject in 1947. At Southampton that same year he founded the first department of electronics in Britain and launched a postgraduate diploma in electronics, which became a highly regarded qualification. He became the first professor of electronics in 1949, and introduced the first BSc course in electronics in Britain in 1959. Zepler's inspirational teaching stimulated students and conveyed to them his insight into electronic systems. With modesty and dedication he led by example the small team of staff which established the teaching and research in what became the leading university department of electronics in Britain. With some of those colleagues he published books on <span class="italic">Electronic Devices and Networks</span> (1963), <span class="italic">Electronic Circuit Techniques</span> (1963), and <span class="italic">Transients in Electronic Engineering</span> (1971). After retiring in 1963, he worked in the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research for ten years. In 1977 he was awarded the honorary degree of DSc. In 1995, in the department of electronics at Southampton University, an exhibition was set up of some of the pre-war radio receivers which he designed, including the Telefunken T9W and the Marconi B28.<br>
<br>Zepler was a distinguished radio engineer whose interests included music, literature, and bridge. His lifelong passion was the composition of chess problems, which led him to publish <span class="italic">Under the Spell of the Chess Problem</span> with Ado Kr&auml;mer in 1951, and to be granted the title of international master of chess composition. His portrait, which was commissioned to mark his presidency of the British Institution of Radio Engineers in 1959&#150;60, and which is kept at the Institution of Electrical Engineers in London, catches the twinkle in his eyes that his colleagues knew so well. Zepler died on 13 May 1980 at Moorgreen Hospital, Southampton, and was cremated at Southampton on 16 May.<br>
