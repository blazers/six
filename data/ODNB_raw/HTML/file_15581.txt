<span class="headword">King,  Paul</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Paulus a Sancto Spiritu]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1655), <span class="occ">Franciscan friar</span>, supposedly baptized David, was the son of Cornelius King, who was employed by one of the barons of Upper Ossory as a clerk or secretary. His uncle, Murtagh King, was a convert to protestantism and beneficed by William Bedell, bishop of Kilmore, who employed him to translate the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> into Irish. King was a native of Leinster, but in early life appears to have fallen victim to piracy, and was imprisoned for a time &#145;among the Moors&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He owed his liberation to the Franciscan friar Luke Wadding. This may have marked the beginning of King's religious life, and he was eventually to take the name in religion Paulus a Sancto Spiritu.<br>
<br>By 1641 King was teaching moral theology at Brindisi in Italy, and in 1644 he was doing similar work at Kilkenny. He probably spent time in Rome in 1646&#150;7. In September 1647 King was appointed lector of theology at Kilkenny friary. There he became a staunch supporter of the papal nuncio Giovanni Battista Rinuccini, who had arrived in Ireland in November 1645, espousing his cause against the supreme council of the confederate Catholics. In May 1648 the nuncio passed his second censure on the confederates in reaction to the perceived implications of their dealings with Lord Inchiquin&#151;the recall of the marquess of Ormond to resume his authority as lord lieutenant. Two months later King, then acting as Rinuccini's confidential agent, was arrested by order of the supreme council. This prompted him to write to Heber Macmahon, bishop of Clogher, inviting Owen Roe O'Neill and his Ulster army, which had always held more aloof from the confederate leadership, to seize Kilkenny and all the nuncio's enemies before Lord Lieutenant Ormond's anticipated arrival in Ireland. The letter was intercepted and King fled to the continent.<br>
<br>In February 1649 King was chosen by the middle chapter of the Franciscan order to rule as guardian of the friary of Kilkenny, but was then replaced by the pseudo-chapter of 1649, which installed the maverick Peter Walsh instead. At Louvain, King wrote a bitter diatribe against Rinuccini's opponents and the Anglo-Irish party generally. This pamphlet, <span class="italic">Epistola nobilis Hiberni</span>, was widely circulated in Catholic Europe, largely by the hands of Franciscan monks in France, Spain, and Italy, in order, so it was said, &#145;to instigate those powers against the English and protestant interest in Ireland&#146;  (Ohlmeyer, 4). But its primary purpose was to distance the supporters of the nuncio from the collapse of the Kilkenny confederacy and lay the blame elsewhere. Offering an extremely partisan view of developments in Ireland, it drew a sharp response from a &#145;controversial and none too scrupulous&#146; Ormondist priest from Cork, John Callaghan, or MacCallaghan, who wrote under the pseudonym Philopater Iranaeus  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). His <span class="italic">Vindiciarum Catholicorum Hiberniae</span>, published at Paris in 1650, which defended the Inchiquin truce, was mistakenly attributed to Richard Bellings, secretary to the Catholic confederacy, under whose name it was entered on the papal index of forbidden books in 1654. Callaghan alleged that King was guilty of numerous crimes, but the attempted betrayal of Kilkenny was the only one he cited. The controversy rumbled on for several years, continuing in the pages of the <span class="italic">Commentarius Rinuccinianus</span> and in a pamphlet written by John Ponce (Punch), who defended his fellow Franciscan against the Ormondists.<br>
<br>At the time of his appointment <i>in absentia</i> as guardian of the Kilkenny friary, King had also received his instructions to set out for Rome on urgent provincial business. He had arrived by the time the Franciscans celebrated the feast of their patron saint in 1649. The support of the order helped King overcome some of the inconvenience of his connection with Rinuccini. Pope Innocent X was said to have lost sympathy with his nuncio after the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle of 1648, while his successor, Alexander VII, was also disparaging of the 1648 censure, having himself resisted treating signatories to the distasteful Westphalian peace in similar fashion while nuncio to the German negotiations. On 21 November 1649 King was nominated guardian of St Isidore's College at Rome in succession to its founder, and King's personal saviour, Luke Wadding, towards whom King later behaved less than graciously. The theologian and historian John Colgan recommended King for the post of commissary responsible for the continental Franciscan colleges, and although he did not receive the appointment King was for some years procurator-general of the order. In his <span class="italic">Vindiciarum</span> Callaghan regretted having had no opportunity to show King's patrons that punishment would have been more fitting than such promotions as these. Ponce, on the other hand, averred that King was worthy of much greater honours. In 1651 King attended the general chapter of the Franciscan order in place of the custos of the Irish province, Patrick Brenan. In 1652 he published a Latin elegy on Cardinal Ximenes. While at Rome, King projected a book in ten volumes in honour of his order, but lived to publish only a kind of syllabus, written in Latin in an &#145;easy style &hellip; with vigour, but incorrectly&#146;, which was licensed in 1654 as an &#145;earnest of a great work&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). It is believed that King died at Rome the following year.<br>
