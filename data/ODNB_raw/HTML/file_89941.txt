<span class="headword">Wettach,  (Charles) Adrien</span> <span class="st"> [<em>performing name </em>Grock]</span>  (1880&#150;1959), <span class="occ">clown</span>, was born at Reconvilier, in the Bernese Jura, Switzerland, on 10 January 1880, one of six children of Jean-Adolphe Wettach (1853&#150;1921), watchmaker and caf&eacute; proprietor, and his wife, C&eacute;cile Fanny P&eacute;quegnat (1853&#150;1941). After leaving school he was apprenticed as a watchmaker, but revealed comic and musical talents, and joined a travelling circus troupe. He took up with the Swiss national circus, where he encountered Marius Galante, who had been one half of the clown act Brick and Brock. When Galante's partner left for military service Wettach teamed up with him in 1903, adopting the name Grock in their partnership of Brick and Grock.<br>
<br>After splitting up with Galante in 1907 Grock joined the Italian clown Antonet (Umberto Guillaume) and enjoyed triumphs in France, Germany, Belgium, Hungary, Denmark, and Spain, gaining lucrative deals with Schumann's circus in Berlin and in 1911 with the Medrano circus in Paris. By then regarded as the world's greatest clown, Grock reckoned<blockquote>the hardest nut was yet to crack, in the shape of an English audience. We had heard how spoiled and cold-blooded they all were. Colleagues had warned us. They had told us how Londoners sat in rows like a lot of polar bears behind a barrier of ice. (<span class="italic">Life's a Lark</span>, 205)</blockquote>Grock and Antonet adapted their show for the variety theatre and made their first British appearance at the Palace Theatre, London, in April 1912. Although not prominently billed, they were a success and their contract was extended to ten weeks. After that they were contracted to other major London variety theatres, including the Alhambra and Empire. Tours of Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, and Birmingham (where he met Charlie Chaplin in 1912) followed, first with Antonet and subsequently, after they separated in September 1913, with a new partner, Geo Lole (Georges Laulhe), who worked with him until June 1914. Grock claimed consistent bad luck with his partners in Britain: one was a drunk, who had to be hustled off the stage at the Alhambra in Glasgow; another refused to shave off his moustache and in desperation Grock cut off one side of it while in their Manchester dressing room.<br>
<br>In 1915 Oswald Stoll signed Grock to appear at the London Coliseum, which he regarded as the world's finest music hall, and where he went on to appear in five consecutive Christmas shows. In June 1918 he successfully took legal action against a fellow clown, Noni (Perezoff), for infringing his copyright in his music hall sketch, which involved producing a tiny violin from an enormous portmanteau, and attempts to play a piano from a seat placed out of reach of the instrument. His popularity was recognized at performances at the Coliseum for allied troops in July 1919, when he was &#145;the great hit of the afternoon&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 July 1919). This was followed by a royal command performance before George V and Queen Mary, who both &#145;laughed heartily at Grock's antics&#146;  (ibid., 29 July 1919). The theatre critic A. B. Walkley struggled to analyse the inevitable &#145;convulsions of laughter&#146; that Grock's act provoked in London audiences: &#145;Why does this queer combination of anthropoid appearance, unearthly noises, physical agility, and musical talent&#151;so flat in description&#151;make one laugh so immoderately in the actual presentation?&#146;  (ibid., 8 Oct 1919).<br>
<br>From 1915 until 1924 Grock lived at 171 Shaftesbury Avenue, London. His first wife, Louise Marie Bullot (1875&#150;1918), whom he had married in Copenhagen in 1914, died at this home in September 1918. He married as his second wife, at the St Giles register office, London, on 11 April 1923, Ines Maria Della Casa (1890&#150;1974), a singer, who was the divorced wife of Stefano Della Casa and daughter of Giulio Ospiri. As well as being a talented musician he was a composer and arranger of music, entering into partnership with the music publisher Leon Silberman at 128 Charing Cross Road from 1916 until the partnership was dissolved in October 1919. Among the sixty Silberman and Grock compositions were &#145;If I were king&#146; (1916), &#145;Once more give me your smile&#146; (1916), &#145;Do it again&#146; (1917), &#145;Angel of my heart&#146; (1917), &#145;My Devon girl&#146; (1918), &#145;On my way to Edinboro toon&#146; and &#145;A-be my boy&#146; (1918).<br>
<br>Despite his admiration for the London Coliseum and its facilities Grock fell out with Stoll over his remuneration. This, together with a disputed income tax claim from the Inland Revenue for &pound;4800, caused him to leave Britain in 1924. He never returned. His fame and popularity consolidated by his British appearances, he went on to conquer the entertainment world, playing the major venues of Europe and North and South America, where he performed before royalty and heads of state, and appeared in several films, earning the sobriquet <i>der K&ouml;nig der Clowns</i> (&#145;the King of Clowns&#146;). After the Second World War he formed the Circus Grock, which toured in Switzerland and Germany from 1951 until his retirement in October 1954, an event that attracted tributes to his technical brilliance  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 Oct 1954). He died at his home, Villa Bianca, Oneglia, Italy, on 14 July 1959 and his ashes were interred there.<br>
