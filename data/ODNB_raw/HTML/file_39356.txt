<span class="headword">Seddon family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1750&#150;1864), <span class="occ">furniture makers</span>, apparently hailed from Lancashire. According to his great-grandson the architect John Pollard Seddon, <a name="cosubject_39354"></a><span class="headword">George [i] Seddon</span>  (<em>c.</em>1727&#150;1801)<span class="occ"></span> is thought to have gone to London about 1750. On his arrival there he established a cabinet-making firm that was to become the largest in the metropolis during the last quarter of the eighteenth century. George [i] Seddon has been identified as the cabinet-maker who, in 1754, purchased his freedom of the London Joiners' Company.<br>
<br>By 1753, when he took on his first apprentice, George [i] Seddon had acquired a 2 acre site in Aldersgate Street including London House (the former residence of the bishop of London), which remained the location of the firm's workshops until 1850. With his wife, Lydia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Oldham (<i>d</i>. 1788), whom he had married by licence (she being over twenty-one) on 14 June 1759 at Holy Sepulchre without Newgate, George [i] Seddon had at least ten children who were baptized in the church of St Botolph, Aldersgate: John (<i>bap</i>. 26 Sept 1760); <a href="#cosubject_74432">Thomas [i] [<i>see below</i>]</a>; Robert (<i>bap</i>. 26 Sept 1762); <a href="#cosubject_74433">George [ii] [<i>see below</i>]</a>; Mary (<i>bap</i>. 4 Oct 1764, <i>d</i>. 1 Dec 1818); Catherine (<i>bap</i>. 12 March 1766); Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 26 April 1767); Lydia (<i>bap</i>. 5 June 1768, <i>d</i>. 13 July 1833); Esther (<i>bap</i>. 22 Dec 1771); and Dorothy (<i>bap</i>. 17 April 1774, <i>d</i>. 1799). The firm expanded quite quickly during the 1760s; by 1768 100 journeymen were employed and in a fire that year &#145;upwards of eighty chests of tools were destroyed&#146;  (Beard and Gilbert, 793). When in 1783 there was a further fire, the firm enjoyed the services of nearly 300 &#145;of the most capital hands&#146; in London  (ibid., 794). The value of stock and household goods insured increased from &pound;3300 in 1768 to &pound;13,000 in 1787, for the business alone.<br>
<br>A remarkable contemporary description of George [i] Seddon's workshop by Sophie von La Roche provides a vivid picture of his business. In 1786, during her journey through England and Holland, she visited:<blockquote>Mr Seddon's, a cabinet-maker &hellip; who employs four hundred journeymen in all sorts of tasks, which are necessary for the proper furnishing of any house: cabinet-makers, wood-carvers, gilders, mirror-workers, upholsterers, brass-founders&#151;who make the fine bronze into ornaments&#151;and locksmiths. All this is carried out in a building with six wings. In the basement mirrors are cast and polished. In one of the other departments nothing is produced but chairs, sofas and stools of all kinds &hellip; One large room is absolutely full up with finished articles in this line, while more rooms are occupied by writing-tables, cupboards, chests-of-drawers. (Gilbert and Wood, 30&#150;34)</blockquote>The visitor also admired &#145;A thousand articles of straw-coloured satinwood, charming and quite perfectly made &hellip; Chinz, silk and wool fabrics for curtains and bed hangings&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Of the proprietor, Sophie von La Roche wrote:<blockquote>Seddon seemed to me a respectable man, as foster-father to four hundred employees, and a man of genius, who understands the requirements both of the needy and the affluent, and who knows how to please them with the products of nature and of other manufactories' artistry; who has made himself master of the qualities of wood from all parts of the world, and has the chemical knowledge how to colour them &hellip; and who has both the managerial ability to appraise the time and trouble spent by all his employees, and the creative talent to keep on devising new forms. (ibid.)</blockquote>A portrait of George [i] Seddon (V&amp;A), painted towards the end of his life, shows a kindly and respectable-looking man, intelligent and unostentatious in manner. This suggests that Sophie von La Roche observed him accurately during her London visit. In his entrepreneurial skills, George [i] Seddon had something in common with the Birmingham manufacturer Matthew Boulton, with whom he had dealings and corresponded. Seddon was also connected to the enterprising Josiah Wedgwood, from whom he purchased medallions which were inserted into his furniture; Wedgwood was also one of his customers.<br>
<br>For a firm of its size, it is perhaps surprising that little surviving eighteenth-century furniture has been identified. There is, however, archival evidence for some major commissions and important patrons: these include Charles Townley for Towneley Hall, Lancashire; Catherine the Great, empress of Russia; Sir Thomas Egerton for Heaton Hall, Yorkshire; the fifth duke of Beaufort for Badminton House, Gloucestershire; the fifth duke of Bedford for Woburn Abbey, Bedfordshire; and the second Lord Mansfield for Kenwood House, Middlesex. Perhaps the most extraordinary creation of the firm was the painted and carved satinwood cabinet fitted as a writing and dressing table, dated 1793, ordered for Charles V of Spain, but not delivered; this piece survived until about 1910, when it was broken up.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_74432"></a><span class="headword">Thomas [i] Seddon</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1761, <em>d.</em> 1804) was baptized on 21 June 1761 and bound apprentice in the Joiners' Company in 1775. <a name="cosubject_74433"></a><span class="headword">George [ii] Seddon</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1763, <em>d.</em> 1815) was baptized on 16 October 1763, and bound apprentice in 1777; he trained as an upholsterer. As liveryman in 1757 and later master, their father was influential in the Joiners' Company. In 1785 George [i] Seddon took both sons into partnership, and from about 1790 or 1791 they were joined by the upholsterer Thomas Shackleton, who had married their sister Mary. Some of the furniture supplied by Seddon, Sons and Shackleton survives in private collections and gives a good indication of their finest late eighteenth-century creations. Among the pieces the partnership delivered to D. Tupper of Hauteville House, St Peter Port, Guernsey, described in M. Harris &amp; Sons, <span class="italic">Old English Furniture</span> (1935, 62&#150;3), and for R. Clarke of Bridwell House, Dorset, some of which was sold at auction at Bearnes, Torquay, Devon, on 14 October 1992, was elegant satinwood furniture with painted decoration.<br>
<br>It is not known how the Seddon house style was created, but it appears that the firm followed the latest fashions, even if their own creative talents were somewhat limited and conservative. George [i] Seddon subscribed to Thomas Chippendale's <span class="italic">Director</span> (1754), Thomas [i] Seddon subscribed to Thomas Sheraton's <span class="italic">Drawing Book</span> (1792) and, in 1826, <a href="#cosubject_39355">Thomas [ii] Seddon</a> and <a href="#cosubject_39356">George [iii] Seddon [<i>see below</i>]</a> signed a prefatory recommendation to <span class="italic">Practical Cabinet Maker</span> by P. Nicholson and M. A. Nicholson. Much of Seddons late eighteenth-century production, in mahogany or satinwood, is of a type familiar from the publications of George Hepplewhite and Thomas Sheraton. In common with other late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century cabinet-makers, Seddons were alive to the commercial prospects of patent and mechanical furniture. About 1780 Seddons invented a writing-table and filing cabinet for Sir Herbert Croft known as a Croft; in 1798 they produced a desk with a rising section of drawers and pigeon-holes controlled by a mechanism patented by Day Gunby; and, at the same period, a patent architect's table.<br>
<br>When George [i] Seddon retired in 1798, the firm passed to his two sons, Thomas [i] Seddon and George [ii] Seddon, with financial provision being made for himself and his three daughters. After his wife, Lydia, had died on 27 March 1788, George [i] Seddon married Jane and he provided in his will for her, his sons, and his daughters. He died at Hampstead on 25 November 1801 and was buried there the following day in the old churchyard. The firm did not prosper, but none the less struggled on during the next two decades, despite a period of bankruptcy. In 1804, the year that Thomas [i] Seddon died, the brothers both served as officers in the volunteer army&#151;Thomas as a lieutenant-colonel and George as a captain of the London (Loyal) 11th regiment. On 26 May 1787 Thomas [i] Seddon had married Mary, daughter of John Pollard, who had earlier lent George [i] Seddon &pound;10,000 to invest in his business. Thomas and Mary had at least eight children, including <a name="cosubject_39355"></a><span class="headword">Thomas [ii] Seddon</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1793, <em>d.</em> 1864)<span class="occ"></span>, who was baptized on 8 January 1793 and apprenticed to his uncle George [ii] Seddon from 1806 to 1813. In 1815 Thomas [ii] Seddon took over the firm and was joined two years later by his brother, <a name="cosubject_39356"></a><span class="headword">George [iii] Seddon</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1797, <em>d.</em> 1857)<span class="occ"></span>, who was baptized on 5 February 1797. By the time of his death, aged fifty-two, in September 1815, George [ii] Seddon had married, but had no children. He was buried on 20 September 1815 at St Botolph, Aldersgate. On 18 August 1820 Thomas [ii] Seddon married at St Martin Orgar with St Clement, Eastcheap, London, Frances Nelson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomas, with whom he had at least eleven children.<br>
<br>Not much is known of the firm from 1815 until 1827 when George [iii] Seddon entered a partnership with Nicholas Morel to supply furniture for George IV at Windsor Castle. The partnership of Morel and Seddon gave its address as 13 Great Marlborough Street, but the manufactory remained in Aldersgate Street. At this date, for the first time, the firm became associated with the manufacture of furniture by named designers. They employed P. Bogaerts, J.-J. Boileau, F.-H.-G. Jacob-Desmalter (in the neo-classical style), and A. W. N. Pugin (in the Gothic style). About 1830 the same partnership supplied furniture to the marquess of Stafford for Stafford House. Much work from these two commissions survives, or can be identified in late nineteenth-century photographs.<br>
<br>The Morel and Seddon partnership appears to have ended by 1831, but Thomas [ii] Seddon and George [iii] Seddon, who received a royal warrant in 1832, continued into the 1850s. After a fire in 1830, when 100 tool chests were destroyed, the firm moved to new premises designed by J. B. Papworth in Gray's Inn Road. Regency-style furniture made during the second quarter of the nineteenth century can sometimes be identified by the firm's paper label attached to the undersides, for example, of tables and cabinets. The artistic and technical quality of surviving furniture by the Seddon family, together with knowledge of the size of their workshops, have ensured that their firms enjoy a high reputation in the history of English furniture making. George [iii] Seddon died, apparently unmarried, at Boulogne, France, on 3 August 1857, and Thomas [ii] Seddon died at his home, 27 Grove Terrace, Kentish Town, London, on 13 September 1864. In the later nineteenth century the family's reputation was enhanced by two of Thomas [ii] Seddon's sons, the Gothic revival architect <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39357/', "John Pollard Seddon (1827&#150;1906)")</script>, and the landscape painter and furniture designer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25010/', "Thomas Seddon (1821&#150;1856)")</script>.<br>
