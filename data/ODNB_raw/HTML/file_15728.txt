<span class="headword">Knight, Sir  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1747, <em>d.</em> 1831), <span class="occ">naval officer and surveyor</span>, was baptized on 21 February 1747 at Dundee, the fourth of five known children of Rear-Admiral John Knight (<i>c</i>.1710&#150;1788) and his wife, Jean Hay. In 1758 Knight joined the frigate <i>Tartar</i>, commanded by his father, in the expedition against St Malo and Cherbourg under Lord Howe. After the peace of 1763 he served in the <i>Romney</i>, flagship of the commander of the North American station, under Lord Colville and his successor Sir Samuel Hood, and gained experience of nautical surveying assisting J. F. W. Des Barres. On 25 May 1770 Knight was commissioned as a lieutenant at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and joined the schooner <i>Diligent</i>. On 15 July 1775 he was taken captive when the ship put into Machias Bay, Maine, and was sent to Northampton, Massachusetts, until his release in a prisoner exchange in November 1776. Having been tried and acquitted for the loss of the <i>Diligent</i>, he was appointed by Lord Howe to command the <i>Haerlem</i>, a former New York privateer sloop. In the <i>Haerlem</i> he was active against the enemy's coasting trade and also engaged in hydrographic work for Des Barres's New England charts. He was next moved to Howe's flagship, the <i>Eagle</i>, and used his intimate knowledge of the coast to lead the fleet through narrow channels to cut off d'Estaing's squadron from Boston. Knight married Prudence Reynolds (<i>d</i>. before 1799) in America on 17 February 1778 and the following autumn returned to England.<br>
<br>In 1780 Knight joined the <i>Barfleur</i>, flagship of Sir Samuel Hood, and was her first lieutenant in the actions off Martinique on 29 April and Chesapeake Bay on 5 September 1781. He was posted captain with command of the <i>Shrewsbury</i> on 21 September 1781, but in January 1782, at Hood's request, he returned to the <i>Barfleur</i> as flag-captain, and commanded her in the action at St Kitts, the skirmish of 9 April, and the battle of the Saints on 12 April. He was personally responsible for the professional education of Prince William Henry, the future William IV and a midshipman in the <i>Barfleur</i>. In 1787&#150;8 Knight was again appointed flag-captain to Hood, first in the <i>Barfleur</i> at Portsmouth, and then in 1793, when Hood became commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, in the <i>Victory</i>. On his return from the Mediterranean Knight was appointed to the <i>Montagu</i> in the North Sea under Admiral Adam Duncan.<br>
<br>When mutiny broke out in 1797 the <i>Montagu</i> was one of the first and worst affected ships. She was taken by her crew to the Nore, where her surgeon was tarred and feathered, and rowed through the fleet. After the mutiny was quelled the <i>Montagu</i> played a distinguished part in the battle of Camperdown on 11 October 1797. In 1798 Knight commanded a detached squadron on the coast of Ireland, and in 1799&#150;1800 he was in command of the inshore squadron blockading Brest, where he made a chart of the area. On 1 October 1799, after Prudence's death, Knight married Love Pickman Oliver (1754&#150;1839), a widow, and daughter of a New England loyalist and Massachusetts judge, Peter Frye. Knight was promoted rear-admiral on 1 January 1801 and in 1805 succeeded Sir Richard Bickerton at Gibraltar where he performed unspectacular work with great confidence. He became vice-admiral on 9 November 1805, admiral on 4 December 1813, and a KCB on 2 January 1815, but saw no further naval service.<br>
<br>Knight's portrait shows a wiry, bright-eyed man. Sir William Hotham, who served with him, considered him clever, brave, professionally able, and &#145;remarkably quick and active&#146;  (Hotham, 1.53). He was a skilful surveyor and his published charts included several of Corsica, Brest, Portsmouth, Cork, and the North Sea. Hood evidently respected him but Hotham reported that he was not popular in naval circles. He had a poor reputation for maintaining discipline and undeserved doubt was cast on his courage at Camperdown.<br>
<br>Knight and his first wife, Prudence, had eight children and, according to Hotham, he was thought to pay too much attention to domestic affairs and consider his ship &#145;more a house in which he was residing with his family than a ship of the British fleet!&#146;  (Hotham, 1.53). Knight died suddenly on 16 June 1831 at his house, Woodend, at Soberton, Hampshire; he was buried at Soberton on 28 June.<br>
