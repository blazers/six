<span class="headword">Pasold,  Eric Walter</span>  (1906&#150;1978), <span class="occ">textile and clothing manufacturer</span>, was born in Fleissen, in the Austro-Hungarian empire (after 1918 it became Plesn&aacute;, in Czechoslovakia), on 19 June 1906, the eldest of the four children of Max Walter Pasold and his wife, Berta, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Geipel. The family, Lutheran and German-speaking, had long been connected with textiles. Eric Pasold was educated at a state school in Fleissen and a textile college in Asch. His involvement in the family business took him on visits to England, and in 1932 he bought a site near Slough and built a small knitting factory. His younger brother, Rolf, joined him, and from 1932 to 1939 they shuttled between England and Czechoslovakia, running both the new venture and the old family firm. The brothers identified themselves with Britain by becoming naturalized British subjects in 1936 and 1937. The Slough business specialized in children's knitted clothing marketed under the trademark Ladybird. Output rose during the war and soared thereafter, and the communist take-over in Czechoslovakia in 1948 ensured that the family enterprise, by then extremely successful, was concentrated in Britain.<br>
<br>In 1957 Pasolds became a public company, though almost all the capital remained in family hands. Problems of marketing, management, and succession loomed, however; the much expanded firm needed something other than the old techniques of family direction. Eric, always the dominant partner in the business, sought a link with one of the big textile groups. The outcome was that in 1965 he sold 54 per cent of the Pasold equity to Coats Paton Ltd. He joined that company's board but resigned after three years. In 1971 Coats Paton bought the remainder of the Pasold equity.<br>
<br>Pasold's approach to business was strongly influenced by the political upheavals of his lifetime. In his twenties he found himself a citizen of a new country whose language he did not speak and whose nationalistic aspirations he did not share. The original family business came to be controlled by the Nazis after Hitler's annexation of the Sudetenland in 1938; a decade later it was confiscated by the communists. Pasold's business success sprang from a combination of technical expertise, an eye for markets, a search for efficiency in an integrated plant, and a tough management style. Characteristically, he conducted much of his international commuting in the 1930s piloting his own aeroplane. During the war he served on numerous textile industry committees. Disillusionment set in during the 1960s; England, he believed, was succumbing to socialism. Devoted to free enterprise, adventurous and individualistic, he had little love for the interventionist ways of trade unions, civil servants, and governments generally.<br>
<br>Pasold had a strong personal interest in the history of textiles and especially of knitting. In 1964 he established the Pasold Research Fund, and in 1968 a lectureship in textile history at Nottingham University was financed. His services to exports were recognized by an OBE in 1961, and his work in education by an honorary MA from Nottingham University in 1977.<br>
<br>In 1969, with his health deteriorating and having sold all his British assets, Pasold retired to Switzerland. He died at 51 Haldenstrasse, Lucerne, on 5 January 1978.<br>
