<span class="headword">Dunbar,  George</span>, ninth earl of Dunbar or of March  (<em>c.</em>1336&#150;1416<span class="mult">x</span>23), <span class="occ">magnate and soldier</span>, was the son of Sir Patrick Dunbar (<i>d</i>. 1357) and his wife, Isabel Randolph. On 25 July 1368 he became earl of Dunbar or March by grant from David II, to whom George's paternal great-uncle Patrick, the eighth earl, had resigned what was a single earldom, its titles increasingly interchangeable from the late thirteenth century. George's paternal inheritance included extensive lands in the Scottish east march, while from his mother, the coheir of the Randolph earls of Moray, he inherited territories elsewhere, including the lordship of Annandale, which made him a significant figure on the western borders too. Moreover he inherited a claim to the Isle of Man which he took seriously, making a grant of lands there <i>c</i>.1372. March's regional influence was initially hampered by English control of large areas of southern Scotland, notably in Berwickshire and Annandale, and it is in his efforts to gain full possession of his inheritance that his military abilities, the hallmark of his career, can first be perceived. He was greatly successful in re-establishing Scottish control in Berwickshire; outside Berwick itself and a small area around it, this had been achieved by the early 1370s. The conquest of Annandale took longer and was completed only with the seizure of the castle of Lochmaben on 4 or 5 February 1384. These military activities of the 1370s and 1380s entailed much more than the reoccupation of disputed border lands. March was engaged in broader, national endeavours as well as personal ones. The Anglo-French war which began again in 1369 went generally badly for the English and was accompanied by sometimes bloody crises in English government and society for over twenty years. These were circumstances ripe for exploitation by the Scots led by March and other belligerent Scottish nobles.<br>
<br>The government of Robert II (1371&#150;90) supported attacks on England, first under the cover of an official Anglo-Scottish truce and then, from 1384, as acts of open war. March was the most effective tool of this new and aggressive Scottish approach. He was responsible for burning English-controlled Roxburgh in 1377 and took part in subsequent heavy raiding which led to his capture of Sir Thomas Musgrave, the keeper of Berwick, in the same year. He also terrorized northern English communities into making blackmail payments to him&#151;in 1379/80 the townsmen of Berwick claimed to be paying tribute to him in money, wine, and victuals. The culmination of Scottish attacks in what was still a time of truce came in 1380, when March defeated and captured Ralph, Baron Greystoke, and most of his force on the eastern border while another Scottish force raided deep into the English west march. March was the main figure in establishing a local Scottish military ascendancy unparalleled since the reign of Robert I. When the Scottish government chose to make open war upon England in 1384, 1385, and 1388&#150;9, March was again heavily involved. An indication of his perceived military value is the 4000 livres tournois he received when a French expeditionary force, complete with treasure chest, arrived in Scotland in 1385. Only the king's eldest son, John, earl of Carrick, and James and Archibald Douglas were given more. In 1388 March was in the Scottish raiding force which encountered Henry Percy (Hotspur) at the battle of Otterburn. James, second earl of Douglas, was killed in the battle, and much credit for the final Scottish victory went to March, who, in English chronicle accounts, also saved the captive Hotspur from death at the hands of enraged retainers of the dead earl of Douglas.<br>
<br>Despite an extremely active career in border warfare and diplomacy, March often kept a low profile on the domestic political scene. In the later years of David II's reign he and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54175/', "John Dunbar")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54174/', "Dunbar family, earls of Moray (per. c.1370&#150;1430)")</script>] were high in royal favour, a position they owed at least in part to the fact that no later than 1369 their sister Agnes had become the king's mistress. On the accession of Robert II in 1371 March does not seem to have suffered for his association with the previous regime; indeed, he and John Dunbar were prominent in supporting the new king against the obscure Douglas &#145;demonstration&#146; which preceded his coronation. Thereafter March's links with the royal court appear to have been distant, but not hostile. In the longer term the earl was on good terms with Robert II's second son, Robert Stewart, who later became duke of Albany and guardian of Scotland. In the 1370s and 1380s he also co-operated happily, especially in the military field, with the other great magnates of the south. In the 1390s, however, he was to assume a more prominent place in national politics. His higher profile came with the relationship, from 1395 at the latest, between his daughter, Elizabeth, and the heir to the throne, David Stewart, earl of Carrick. There was political opposition to this match: Robert III, whose relations with March had probably long been cool, is reported to have besieged Dunbar Castle, the earl's chief seat, probably in autumn 1396, in a bid to oppose his son's connection with Elizabeth Dunbar. The couple may have been forced to separate, but Earl George clearly still expected the union to go ahead. His reaction was furious when David Stewart, now duke of Rothesay, rejected Elizabeth in 1400 in favour of Mary Douglas, a daughter of the aged Archibald the Grim, third earl of Douglas, and sister of Archibald, master of Douglas. The younger Archibald became fourth earl in 1402 and was March's great political and military rival for several years. March responded to his family's dishonour by appealing to the new king of England, Henry IV. Accounts of the earl's subsequent defection to English allegiance stress power politics and the quest for increased authority within Scotland. There was no doubt an element of this, but from March's point of view the issue of outraged honour evident in the contemporary sources needs to be considered as well. A man previously content to take care of his regional interests and play little part in central politics felt driven to take drastic action which was hardly a coldly calculated political move; indeed, its results were disastrous for his family.<br>
<br>The repercussions of March's defection were important; and just as his actions impacted on great events he remained an important player in them. In Scotland his switch of allegiance ushered in an extremely turbulent period which resulted in the (highly probable) murder of Rothesay in 1402 and the long-lasting political dominance of the duke of Albany. In regional terms it helped bring about an unprecedented dominance of southern Scotland by the Douglas family, not least because March was deserted by a number of his leading tenants and retainers, including his nephew Robert Maitland, the keeper of Dunbar Castle. In an international context March had a role in spurring Henry IV to mount an ineffective invasion of Scotland in 1400, which in turn inspired continued Scottish belligerence in the following years. One factor that now worked against Anglo-Scottish rapprochement was the ferocious personal feud between March and the fourth earl of Douglas. In the former's absence Douglas took over his lands in Annandale and the east march. Warfare in the borders increasingly came to be driven by local rivalries and regional concerns. Military success continued to accompany March. He defeated a major Scottish raiding force at Nisbet on 22 June 1402 and was with the English host on 14 September following when a full-scale Scottish army met disaster at the battle of Homildon Hill. Although overall command lay with the earl of Northumberland and Henry Percy, the tactics that brought victory were March's. The earl of Douglas was taken captive, as was Murdoch Stewart, Albany's son; much of the higher nobility of Scotland was captured or killed.<br>
<br>Homildon Hill had important consequences: it decisively ended a thirty-year period in which the Scots felt they could pursue ambitious political objectives through military means. They were never so confident nor consistently belligerent again. In a real sense the battle ended (in stalemate) the century-long Scottish wars of independence. It also acted as a spur (for various reasons) for the Percy family to rise against Henry IV in 1403. March remained true to his royal master and his advice helped bring about the defeat at Shrewsbury of the greatest challenge to Henry IV's rule. For a second time March defeated both Hotspur (who was killed) and Douglas (who was captured again). His military career was outstanding, as his contemporaries noticed. In the words of Walter Bower, &#145;He was accounted most fortunate in every fighting encounter, for his side always prevailed&#146;  (Bower, 8.117). For his efforts on King Henry's behalf he and his family were given lands and annuities, while by a more symbolic reward he was permitted to style his herald Shrewsbury. Yet March was unable to retain a power-base in Scotland and the impecunious Henry could hardly endow him in a manner commensurate with his previous lofty standing. The Dunbar family seem to have been in desperate financial straits in England, as their recurrent appeals for money show. Finally in 1408 a return to Scotland was arranged and a truncated earldom of March was regained in 1409. He was now an old man, aged over seventy, but March's military expertise apparently continued to be appreciated, since in the following year he was one of a small group of nobles consulted by Albany as to how to counter the growing threat from the lord of the Isles. But such services did nothing to win back his lordship of Annandale, and the fortunes of his family never recovered.<br>
<br>That March was able to switch allegiance to the English crown while maintaining at least a measure of support in south-east Scotland says much about aristocratic mentalities and the bonds of loyalty that powerful magnates could inspire. Before 1400 he seems to have been an implacable, militant enemy of England. Yet this perception obscures another strand in the earl's career, his long-standing links of friendship and co-operation across the border. In the 1380s and 1390s he consistently attempted to maintain the traditional attachment of Coldingham Priory in Berwickshire to Durham Cathedral priory in spite of attempts to introduce Scottish monks there. His efforts were recognized when he and his wife, Christiana (probably <i>n&eacute;e</i> Seton), were admitted to the confraternity of Durham in 1418. Affection for Durham perhaps indicates an attachment to the cross-border cult of St Cuthbert, and more certainly a recognizably east march sensibility. March also had amicable contacts with the gentry and aristocracy of Northumberland and trading links with Newcastle and further afield. This aristocratic internationalism reached further than Northumberland. A major exporter of wool, the earl had direct trading links in the Low Countries and fiscal connections in the Baltic. Yet despite foreign ties and membership of the brotherhood of the international aristocracy it was the misfortune of March to defect to England at a time when national sentiments were gaining increasing power, so that his lands in Scotland were swiftly taken over by those who could claim to represent an undiluted animosity to the traditional enemy. The Dunbar family, meanwhile, clearly encountered hostility in northern England, especially after Henry Percy's death at Shrewsbury. And indeed the earl's own followers, despite his apparently smooth transition from Scottish marcher lord to English agent, show that the power of national sentiment was on the increase. Fully seven years after his defection, in 1407, some eighty of his followers occupied the village of Navenby in Lincolnshire. They held it to ransom, terrorized the inhabitants, and defied resistance, shouting at the &#145;tailed English dogs&#146; who hesitated to confront them.<br>
<br>The ninth earl of March was in a British context the foremost warrior of his time and he had a lofty conception of his own status to match this prominence. A now lost tomb inscription gives vivid testimony of local and familial pride. It speaks of a man who ruled in his own sphere, the eastern borders of Scotland, for some fifty years and whose family prestige and kinship ties with three royal houses put him on a par with monarchy. His historical standing, however, has not been overly prominent, no doubt partly because he was a turncoat to both the Scottish and the English crowns. In view of this relative obscurity it is somehow fitting that there is no certain dating for March's death, contradictory evidence suggesting dates ranging between 1416 and 1423. He was buried in Dunbar collegiate church.<br>
<br>The ninth earl of March had six recorded sons and a daughter from his marriage (<i>c</i>.1360) to Christiana (<i>d</i>. after 1418) and also an illegitimate son, Nicholas. He was succeeded as earl by his eldest son, another <a name="cosubject_54173"></a><span class="headword">George Dunbar</span>  (<em>c.</em>1370&#150;1455<span class="mult">x</span>7)<span class="occ"></span>, who gave firm support to James I at the beginning of his reign and was made warden of the east march by him, probably in 1424. But his hopes of further recovering his family's position were disappointed. His Douglas rivals were now too firmly entrenched in south-east Scotland, and in 1430 March was replaced as warden of the east march by William Douglas, second earl of Angus. In 1432 a quarrel with Angus led to royal intervention, and James may have decided that March's loyalty could not be trusted, for in 1434 he had the earl arrested and forfeited him a year later. A grant of the earldom of Buchan was little compensation and may not have become effective, not least because Dunbar withdrew to England in search of support there. He retained the barony of Kilconquhar, Fife, held from the bishop of St Andrews, and eventually retired there, supported by a pension of 400 merks from the revenues of his former earldom, but neither he nor any of his descendants held comital rank again. He may have married twice. His wife, Beatrice (surname unknown), with whom he had three sons and two daughters, had died by 1421, when he had licence to marry Alice Hay of Yester, but the marriage may not have taken place. He died between 1455 and 1457.<br>
<br>Among George's younger brothers was <a name="cosubject_8201"></a><span class="headword">Columba Dunbar</span>  (<em>c.</em>1386&#150;1435), <span class="occ">bishop of Moray</span>, who withdrew to England with the rest of his family in 1400 and was dispensed to hold benefices without cure of souls in that year. Presented to the deanship of the royal free chapel in Bridgnorth in 1403, he studied arts at Oxford. He lost his position at Bridgnorth on returning to Scotland in 1409, but was dean of Dunbar collegiate church by 1412 and was made archdeacon of Lothian in 1419. He had been ordained priest by 3 April 1422, when he was provided to the see of Moray. Little is known of his activities as bishop, but he attended to the restoration of his cathedral, devastated by the earl of Buchan in 1390&#151;Dunbar's arms appear on the west gable of the nave. In 1429 he went to Rome as the king's envoy and in 1434 had an English safe conduct to attend the council of Basel, though it seems unlikely that he went. He died at Spynie, near Elgin, in 1435, some time before his successor was recorded as bishop-elect on 7 November. He may be represented by the effigy of a bishop in Elgin Cathedral, where he was probably buried.<br>
