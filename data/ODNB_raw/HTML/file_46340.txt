<span class="headword">Bruce,  Frederick Fyvie</span>  (1910&#150;1990), <span class="occ">biblical scholar</span>, was born on 12 October 1910 in Elgin, the eldest of the seven children of Peter Fyvie Bruce (1874&#150;1955), an evangelist among the Christian Brethren, and his wife, Mary Maclennan (1883&#150;1965). From Elgin Academy (1921&#150;8) he proceeded to study classics at Aberdeen (MA, 1932) and Cambridge (BA, 1934), followed by a year in Vienna as holder of the Sandys scholarship. The possibility of further doctoral study in philology was overtaken by appointment to a junior teaching post in Greek in Edinburgh (1935&#150;8) and then to a lectureship in classics in Leeds (1938&#150;47). During this period he developed his scholarly interest in biblical studies and in the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in particular; he won the Crombie scholarship in biblical criticism in 1939 and took a diploma in Hebrew in 1943. Although he had no degree in biblical or theological subjects and was never ordained he was appointed to the headship of the newly created department of biblical studies in Sheffield in 1947, and worked to such good effect that he was appointed to a chair in 1955 and was awarded an Aberdeen honorary DD in 1957. In 1959 he was appointed to the Rylands chair of biblical criticism and exegesis in Manchester (in the distinguished succession of A. S. Peake, C. H. Dodd, and T. W. Manson) where he remained until retirement in 1978.<br>
<br>Bruce had an international reputation as a biblical scholar. He travelled and lectured in institutions throughout the world. He shared with only one other scholar the honour of being president of both the (British) Society for Old Testament Study (1965) and the (international) Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas (1975); he was elected a fellow of the British Academy (1973) and was awarded its Burkitt medal (1979). He was awarded a DLitt from Leeds University in 1988. He received three Festschriften by colleagues and former students.<br>
<br>Bruce was a prolific writer with some fifty books and hundreds of articles to his credit. His scholarly career began with a major commentary on the <span class="roman">Acts of the Apostles</span> (1951) in which he dealt with the Greek text linguistically and historically from the vantage point of a classical scholar; simultaneously he was also at work on a more theologically orientated volume, <span class="italic">The Book of the Acts</span> (1953). From <span class="roman">Acts</span> he moved naturally into the Pauline literature and wrote commentaries of varying scale on most of the letters; those on <span class="roman">Galatians</span> (1982) and <span class="roman">1 and 2 Thessalonians</span> (1982) are the most substantial. A host of public lectures and essays formed the basis for his major study, <span class="italic">Paul: Apostle of the Free Spirit</span> (1977). He also wrote a fine commentary on <span class="roman">Hebrews</span> (1964). He was among the first scholars to discuss the impact of the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls on biblical studies (<span class="italic">Second Thoughts on the Dead Sea Scrolls</span>, 1956; <span class="italic">Biblical Exegesis in the Qumran Texts</span>, 1959). He wrote standard textbooks on early Jewish history (<span class="italic">Israel and the Nations</span>, 1963) and the history of the early church (<span class="italic">The Spreading Flame</span>, 1953; <span class="italic">New Testament History</span>, 1969).<br>
<br>Bruce's scholarship was marked by the way in which he brought his classical training to the study of the biblical texts. This tended to liberate him from the theological bias and even prejudice that can interfere with objective biblical study. He was able to harvest the results of archaeological study for the illumination of the written texts of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Writing initially at a time when so-called &#145;higher criticism&#146; often disparaged the historical value of the biblical writings, he came to a much more positive evaluation of their historical worth. Admittedly this conclusion was congenial to his own theological position. He was nurtured in a conservative, evangelical tradition in the Christian Brethren and never wavered from it, but his scholarly conclusions were not preformed but relied on sober study of the evidence, and he was certainly not afraid to differ from his more conservative colleagues when he was convinced that the evidence required him to do so. At the same time he was respected by scholars who took a more radical view of the evidence than he did, precisely because he respected them and their work.<br>
<br>Bruce played an important part in stimulating the development of biblical and theological scholarship in his own evangelical Christian constituency. He was a founder member and sometime chairman of the Tyndale Fellowship for Biblical Research, and he was honorary president of the Inter-Varsity Fellowship in 1955. Particularly in Manchester he guided the studies of a remarkable number of doctoral students.<br>
<br>Bruce was an outstanding example of the genus <i>Scholar</i> rather than <i>Researcher</i>. He had an encyclopaedic and exact knowledge in many fields, and the ability to express himself in a lucid and attractive manner. His scholarship was entirely free from eccentricity and weakly based hypotheses.<br>
<br>Bruce was an active member of the church and much in demand as a lay preacher and speaker. His spoken style could be somewhat dry, but he shone in panel discussions and informal occasions when his capacity for relating anecdotes and his pawky Scottish humour came to the fore. He wrote an autobiographical account, <span class="italic">In Retrospect: Remembrance of Things Past</span> (1980), which is a delightful description of the academic and Christian scene, especially during his earlier years in the north-east of Scotland. He married Annie Bertha Davidson, known as Betty (1910&#150;1994), daughter of A. B. Davidson, a Scottish farmer, on 19 August 1936, and they had two children, Iain and Sheila. He was an essentially humble and ordinary person with no side, able to fit in with whatever company he was in. He never drove a car nor acquired a computer; he corrected the proofs of the English translation of the <span class="italic">Theologisches W&ouml;rterbuch zum Neuen Testament</span> on his daily train journeys. Bruce died at his home, The Crossways, 2 Temple Road, Buxton, on 11 September 1990 and was buried at Buxton cemetery a week later.<br>
