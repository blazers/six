</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lucas,  Charles</span>  (1713&#150;1771), <span class="occ">politician and physician</span>, was born on 16 September 1713 in co. Clare, a younger son of Benjamin Lucas (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1727), a gentleman farmer of Ballingaddy, and Mary Blood. His great-grandfather, Lieutenant-Colonel Benjamin Lucas, was a Cromwellian officer who had been granted lands in co. Clare after service in the wars of the 1640s. Little is known about Lucas's early years, but the assertion that his father had squandered his estate  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) is belied by the fact that he left effects worth in excess of &pound;900 to his wife and their large family, the sum of &pound;80 being apportioned to Charles.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>After his father's death about 1727, Lucas was apprenticed as an apothecary in Dublin city and set up shop there in the 1730s. He married his first wife, Anne Blundell, in 1734. Undeterred by the fact that he was a newcomer to the apothecary's trade, he wrote against frauds and abuses in the preparation and sale of drugs. His campaign was instrumental in securing legislation in 1736 which authorized the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland to inspect apothecaries' shops. His stance also provoked the enduring enmity of many of his colleagues, and may have contributed to an initial failure in business which necessitated a temporary retreat to London about 1737.<br>
<br>Lucas's political involvement began with his appointment in 1741 as a representative of the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Guild on the common council of Dublin corporation, where he soon demonstrated that attachment to radicalism which would mark his later career. The council of Dublin corporation was bicameral, the upper house consisting of the lord mayor and 24 aldermen, the lower house of a maximum 48 sheriff's peers, 96 representatives of the city's guilds, and 2 sheriffs who presided jointly. The corporation's constitution was based partly on royal charters and established usage, but principally on &#145;New Rules&#146; passed in 1672 during the viceroyalty of the earl of Essex. These rules were designed to strengthen the role of the lord mayor and aldermen by vesting in them power to appoint higher city officers and to vet guild representatives on the council. Though regarded by whigs and radicals on the council as a product of Stuart despotism, the New Rules survived into the Hanoverian period. An attempt was made by William Howard to have the rules repealed following his election as MP for Dublin in 1727, and a corporation committee considered municipal reforms in the 1730s.<br>
<br>In alliance with James Digges La Touche, a Merchants' Guild representative and a member of the wealthy Huguenot merchant and banking family, Lucas commenced a new campaign for municipal reform in 1742. They sought to limit the oligarchic powers of the upper house and to increase the influence of the lower house. The reformers represented the protestant freemen or enfranchised citizens of Dublin only, whose entitlement to participate in municipal and parliamentary elections depended on their membership of the city's exclusive trade guilds. Under the penal laws Catholics were denied participation in politics even at the municipal and guild level. Lucas issued a series of pamphlets in support of the campaign for municipal reform, the most notable being <span class="italic">A Remonstrance Against Certain Infringements</span> (1743) and <span class="italic">Divelina libera</span> (1744). The campaign culminated in a lawsuit in the court of king's bench in 1744, when Lucas and La Touche unsuccessfully challenged the aldermen's power of self-election, and shortly thereafter the two lost their seats on the city council.<br>
<br>In January 1747 an outbreak of rioting occurred in Smock Alley Theatre as a result of attempts by the manager, Thomas Sheridan, to curb rowdy excesses by &#145;gentlemen&#146; members of the audience. Lucas entered the fray as a champion of Sheridan and produced several pamphlets in letter form in February and March 1747, in which, untypically, he concealed his identity behind a pseudonym, &#145;A Freeman, Barber and Citizen&#146;. Noting that the most prominent rioter, one Kelly, was a Catholic from the province of Connaught, Lucas warned of a relapse into the slavery and barbarism that had characterized the ancient Irish. He claimed that there was more to the riots than a mere theatrical dispute, and that they were the work of a group of &#145;professed Papists&#146; and &#145;mercenary converts&#146; preparing for &#145;a foreign invasion, a western insurrection or an universal massacre&#146; (C. Lucas, <span class="italic">A [First] Letter</span>, 1747, 2; C. Lucas, <span class="italic">A Second Letter</span>, 1747, 10). Taken by themselves, these letters are undoubtedly unpleasant and seem to confirm that Lucas was a bigot, and the memory of them would live on to become the principal basis for Lucas's reputation as an ultra-protestant zealot. Yet the obsessive anti-Catholicism of his &#145;Barber&#146; persona was in fact uncharacteristic of Lucas, and in later years he would become less preoccupied with the dangers of popery and more favourably disposed towards Catholics and ancient Ireland.<h2>
<a name="Thepoliticalconstitutions"></a>The political constitutions</h2>Lucas's next opportunity for political action came during the Dublin by-election of 1748&#150;9, when the city's two parliamentary seats fell vacant due to the deaths of the aldermanic incumbents. He declared himself a candidate and, in uneasy alliance with La Touche, sought to end the virtual monopoly of Dublin city's parliamentary representation by aldermen of Dublin corporation. As well as making fiery speeches in the guild halls, Lucas bombarded the voters with pamphlet addresses and letters designed as much to educate them in correct political principles as to advance his own candidacy. He reprinted these tracts in a collected edition in 1751, under the title <span class="italic">The Political Constitutions of Great Britain and Ireland</span>. This publication may be one of the more important but neglected Irish political texts of the eighteenth century, as well as being Lucas's most coherent work. Though Lucas was a somewhat quixotic personality, and his style not infrequently emotive and pedantic, the <span class="italic">Political Constitutions</span> is quite readable, as well as being fairly systematically laid out and containing much matter of interest.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Political Constitutions</span> is composed of lengthy prefatory material, twenty election addresses, and six letters to the citizens of Dublin, all written by Lucas, together with selected reprints from Lucas's election newspaper, <span class="italic">The Censor</span>, many of the latter articles being written by other authors. Lucas's election campaign was not confined merely to municipal matters, as has sometimes been implied, but encompassed much larger political issues. It was in his attempt to demonstrate that the British constitution was also the birthright of the Irish that Lucas was to be most controversial, and indeed original, making a distinct but still not adequately recognized contribution to the development of Irish nationalist thought. In his tenth address, of 13 January 1749, Lucas paraphrased the ideas of the constitutionalist William Molyneux, to the effect that Ireland was not a conquered colony dependent on Great Britain. He then went on to make a radical statement which eventually would land him in serious trouble with the authorities: &#145;It must now be confessed that there was no general rebellion in Ireland, since the first British invasion, that was not raised or fomented by the oppression, instigation, evil influence or connivance of the English&#146;  (C. Lucas, <span class="italic">Political Constitutions</span>, 1751, 123). In his eleventh address, of 31 January 1749, Lucas went even further in his critique of English misgovernment, claiming that although the native Irish in medieval times had shown their willingness to submit to English law, they had been treated as badly &#145;as the Spaniards used the Mexicans, or as inhumanly as the English now treat their slaves in America&#146;  (ibid., 134). He concluded with an attack on the <span class="roman">Declaratory Act</span> of 1720, which he saw as evidence of the increase of the &#145;destructive excrescence of English power&#146;  (ibid., 143), thereby signalling clearly that his words had a contemporary as well as a historical import.<br>
<br>Lucas did not pursue his ideas concerning the treatment of the native Irish, and indeed it is remarkable that he advanced them at all given his protestant prejudices. Yet he more than hinted at the existence of an inclusive Irish nation that transcended the anglican and dissenter sections of the population and had a common interest in resisting English domination, even if he was not prepared to concede that all sections of society should possess a complete equality of civil rights.<br>
<br>A tract dated 18 August 1749, reprinted in the <span class="italic">Political Constitutions</span>, in the form of a letter to the citizens of Dublin, is evidence that Lucas's views on the Catholic question had also softened. Lucas claimed that he pitied rather than condemned the religious errors of the &#145;Papists or Romanists&#146;, and had the popes not claimed temporal power, he would &#145;know no difference between the civil rights of a Papist and a Protestant&#146;  (Lucas, <span class="italic">Political Constitutions</span>, 443). Hence he believed that Catholics should be free to worship according to their consciences, and should be compelled only to pay &#145;due allegiance to the established civil constitution&#146;  (ibid., 443). Lucas concluded his religious reflections by stating that all subjects, &#145;whether Papist or Protestant, Jew or Gentile&#146;, should have &#145;the full protection and benefit of the law&#146; and the liberty to dispose of their persons and property as they chose, subject to the just laws of God and man  (ibid., 443&#150;4). Lucas's comments in this letter show that he had undoubtedly modified his position since 1747, and while not committing himself to a call for their repeal, he displayed none of the enthusiastic support for the penal laws which might be expected from a bigot.<br>
<br>It is also significant that Charles O'Conor of Belanagare, the leading Catholic spokesman and writer against the penal laws, was sufficiently interested in the Dublin election controversy to issue a pamphlet in Lucas's defence in 1749, entitled <span class="italic">A Counter-Appeal to the People of Ireland</span>. Unfortunately this has tended to be overshadowed or negated by a letter hostile to Lucas which was fabricated by O'Conor's grandson and biographer, the Revd Dr Charles O'Conor. This forgery coloured the hostile attitude towards Lucas shown by nineteenth-century historians such as Plowden and Lecky, and remains to influence the unwary today due to its inclusion in the 1988 edition of O'Conor's correspondence. A further indication that those with pro-Catholic sympathies were inclined to support Lucas in 1749 exists in the form of five articles in <span class="italic">The Censor</span>, which may have been the work of the young Edmund Burke. The articles, some of which were signed with the letter &#145;B&#146;, a signature used by Burke in his own journal, <span class="italic">The Reformer</span>, exhibit a lofty tone and support Lucas in a relatively cautious and moderate way, but include a specific recommendation that &#145;penal laws&#146; should now be relaxed.<h2>
<a name="Parliamentaryinvestigationandexile"></a>Parliamentary investigation and exile</h2>As the election paper war raged in the summer and autumn of 1749, the controversy surrounding Lucas's candidacy came to a head. Following pointed comments by the lord lieutenant, the earl of Harrington, in his opening speech to the Irish parliament on 10 October 1749, the House of Commons mounted an investigation into Lucas's election writings and summoned him for questioning. Even as the house deliberated on his case, in <span class="italic">The Censor</span> of 14 October a defiant Lucas courageously but unwisely quoted from a work by James Anderson DD, which claimed that Ireland was a distinct kingdom, that Catholics had believed they were taking arms in their own defence during the rising of 1641, and that both sides in the conflict had been guilty of atrocities. Belief in Catholic guilt in 1641 was almost an article of faith among moderate as well as extreme protestants, and Lucas's stance on 1641 and Irish risings must surely call into question his reputation as an extreme anti-Catholic bigot.<br>
<br>On 16 October 1749 the House of Commons voted that certain of Lucas's election publications were seditious and promoted insurrection, that he had justified past rebellions and reflected scandalously on the lord lieutenant and parliament, and that he was an enemy to his country and should be imprisoned in Newgate. Fearing that his angry followers would attempt a violent uprising and that his health would not withstand imprisonment, Lucas yielded to the pleas of friends and fled by boat to the Isle of Man. He was by this stage a widower, and was obliged to leave his children behind him.<br>
<br>The removal of Lucas from the scene was probably a satisfactory outcome so far as the government and his enemies were concerned, and polling commenced in his absence on 24 October. Although Lucas's running mate La Touche won one of the two parliamentary seats, he was later to be unseated by the House of Commons on the grounds of alleged electoral irregularities, and the representation of Dublin city therefore remained safely in the hands of the aldermanic party for the time being.<br>
<br>Lucas made his way from the Isle of Man to London, where he issued some pseudonymous pamphlets and endeavoured to interest the corporation of London in his case. He then &#145;threw aside the political pen&#146; and travelled to the continent to study medicine  (Lucas, <span class="italic">An Appeal to the Commons and Citizens of London</span>, 1756, p. 1). Having studied at the University of Paris, he graduated MD at the University of Rheims in 1751, and secured a further MD from the University of Leiden in 1752. The title of his Leiden thesis was <span class="italic">De gangrena et spacelo</span>.<br>
<br>Lucas returned to England in 1753, and while he maintained an interest in matters political, most of his energies in the years following seem to have been devoted to building up his medical practice, and publishing the results of his research on European spas, his principal work in this area being <span class="italic">An Essay on Waters</span> (1756). Samuel Johnson reviewed this work, and while expressing scepticism concerning the curative effects of cold bathing, he took a surprisingly sympathetic view of Lucas's political misfortunes, observing that he had been &#145;driven into exile for having been the friend of his country&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.311). Lucas brought his genius for controversy to his medical activities also, becoming involved in acrimonious debate with the medical faculty at Bath in the late 1750s, on the subject of the professional methods of its members.<h2>
<a name="Parliamentarysuccess"></a>Parliamentary success</h2>The more relaxed political conditions immediately following the accession of George III in 1760 encouraged Lucas to return to Ireland in order to contest the subsequent general election. In May 1761 he won one of Dublin's two parliamentary seats by a narrow margin, having established in a court action that the legal proceedings initiated against him in 1749 were no longer pending. Lucas threw himself with enthusiasm into his new role as a parliamentarian, his most important legislative achievement being the <span class="roman">Octennial Act</span> of 1768, which provided for regular general elections; he also secured additional legislation controlling the sale of drugs. Having been derided earlier for being a mere tradesman, Lucas was now subject to the charge that he was a corporation politician out of his depth in parliament, but his legislative record shows that his transition from municipal to parliamentary politics was perhaps not quite so unsuccessful as claimed.<br>
<br>While there is no evidence that Lucas exerted himself in support of the developing Catholic campaign for relief from the penal laws in the 1760s, neither is there any evidence that he wrote systematically in a bigoted fashion against Catholics, as was alleged by Madden for example. Lucas was closely associated with the radical newspaper, the <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span>, which although it published letters hostile to Catholics, also gave space to some pro-Catholic correspondence, indicating an attitude of growing tolerance if not sympathy among protestant radicals. Yet Lucas did support &#145;quarterage&#146;, an unjust exaction which Catholics had to pay to the protestant-controlled trade guilds, despite not being allowed to become full members.<br>
<br>Lucas had remarried on 27 March 1760 at St James's, Westminster, his bride being Penelope (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1765), daughter of Colonel Robert Catherwood. Following Penelope's death Lucas married again in 1768, his third wife being Elizabeth Hely, who survived him. All three of Lucas's wives bore children; of these only the eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17129/', "Henry Lucas (c.1740&#150;1802)")</script>, rose to prominence, achieving some minor fame as a court poet.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Lucas's final years were marked by even more intense conflict with the administration, particularly over the issue of augmenting the army in Ireland, and he continued to assert the Irish right to autonomy, never moderating his criticisms of English misgovernment. His relations with the lord lieutenant, Viscount Townshend, were particularly poor, and the latter wrote of him in 1768: &#145;Here is a Dr Lucas, the Wilkes of Ireland, who has been playing the devil here and poisoning all the soldiery with his harangues and writings&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 2.303). In the wake of Townshend's prorogation of parliament in December 1769 in response to its refusal to pass a money bill, Lucas issued a strongly worded denunciation entitled <span class="italic">The Rights and Privileges of Parliament Asserted</span> (1770). The parallels between events in Ireland and those in the increasingly restive American colonies were clear to Irish patriots, and following the Boston massacre in 1770 the townsmen sent Lucas an account of the incident.<br>
<br>So disabled by gout that he frequently had to be carried to and from the House of Commons, Lucas died aged fifty-eight on 4 November 1771 at his home in Henry Street, Dublin. He was buried on 7 November in Dublin's St Michan's churchyard (where his gravestone may still be seen). As well as his son Henry and other relatives, the large funeral procession included members of Dublin corporation and the city guilds, over 200 scholars of Trinity College, and friends and colleagues such as the earl of Charlemont and Henry Flood.<br>
<br>Lacking independent means, Lucas's participation in unremunerative politics meant that he was not infrequently financially embarrassed, and his widow Elizabeth was obliged to apply for a municipal pension after his death. There are several portraits of Lucas, by Reynolds and Hickey among others, but the physical frailty and nervous energy of the man are perhaps best captured in the statue by Edward Smyth in Dublin's City Hall in Dame Street. This remarkably realistic piece of work shows Lucas in full oratorical flight, and also portrays an injured eye which he had sustained in a laboratory accident in his younger days.<br>
<br>Townshend's &#145;the Wilkes of Ireland&#146; is the best remembered description of Lucas, although it obscures the fact that his campaigns antedated those of the English radical. The relative obscurity into which Lucas fell after his death may be due first to the fact that his period has been overshadowed by the more dramatic events of the late eighteenth century, and second to the absence of a substantial body of surviving personal papers or a near-contemporary published memoir or biography. The lack of personal papers is compensated for significantly by Lucas's copious published writings, and it may be that the unfounded belief that they are uniformly tedious and unimportant has discouraged historians from paying them due attention. Lucas's medical career was also significant, and his efforts to control the manufacture and sale of drugs are actually somewhat better remembered today than his political campaigns. Lucas's personality could be difficult and his habits were certainly independent, yet his reputation for anti-Catholicism has been greatly exaggerated, and his significant contribution to the evolution of Irish nationalism has not received the recognition it deserves.<br>
