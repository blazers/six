<span class="headword">Noble, Sir  Andrew</span>, first baronet  (1831&#150;1915), <span class="occ">industrialist and expert in artillery</span>, the third son of the twelve children of George Noble (<i>d</i>. 1847), a retired naval captain of Greenock, Renfrewshire, and his wife, Georgiana, only daughter of Andrew Donald Moore of Ottercaps, Virginia, USA (formerly of Ayrshire), was born at 65 Union Street, Greenock, on 13 September 1831. His father came of a landed Dunbartonshire family. Andrew was first educated in Greenock and later at Edinburgh Academy, and entered Woolwich as a cadet in the spring of 1847. In June 1849 he joined the Royal Artillery, served for eleven years, being made captain in 1855. Most of his uneventful military career was abroad. While in Canada he met, and in 1854 married, Margery Durham (<i>d</i>. 1929), daughter of Archibald Campbell, a notary in Quebec; they had four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Always interested in mathematics and chemistry, Noble embraced several scientific pursuits before concentrating on the branch of inquiry in which he was to gain distinction. He returned to England from the Cape in January 1858, and, on being made secretary to the Royal Artillery Institution at Woolwich, found the naval and military authorities in controversy over superseding the old muzzle-loaded, smooth-bore guns by a new system of breech-loaded, rifled artillery. Remarkably, no advance in gunnery had been made between the Napoleonic and the Crimean wars. It was soon after the battle of Inkermann that William George Armstrong submitted to the War Office for trial his rifled breech-loading field gun, and began a controversy which agitated military minds for several years. The subject exactly suited Noble's aptitude for patient, scientific experiment and accurate observation, and he lost no time in taking part in it. In September 1858 he was appointed secretary to the special committee on rifled cannon, and the new system of artillery was adopted officially by the services towards the end of 1858, a step which polarized opposition by the more conservative military men.<br>
<br>Noble was increasingly recognized as an artillery specialist, and in August 1860 resigned from the army to join Armstrong's Elswick Ordnance Company, Newcastle upon Tyne, where the government orders for rearmament were then being carried out. Armstrong valued the specialist military technical knowledge which Noble would bring to the firm, and offered him a partnership in the business and joint management, with George W. Rendel, of the works. In 1863 the Elswick Ordnance Company was amalgamated with the adjacent Hydraulic Engineering Works as Sir W. G. Armstrong &amp; Co., with Noble as an original partner. Noble was now free to pursue his scientific inquiries, and he made full use of the resources for his experiments in ballistics and explosives. His experiments and observations followed the lines of those of T. J. Rodman, Sir Benjamin Thompson (Count Rumford), and earlier investigators, in ascertaining the conditions which follow an explosion, but he carried the examination of fired gunpowder further than any of his predecessors. Confining the charge in a closed steel vessel, he determined the temperatures and pressures created, and analysed the gases and residues. Based on these experiments he developed methods for recording the pressures in the chamber of a gun, and the velocity of the projectile in its passage through the bore. His techniques were entirely new, and the exact science of ballistics is due to his work. The practical result of his experiments and conclusions was a complete alteration in the composition of gunpowder and in the design of guns. The use of hand rammed black powder was superseded by slow-burning explosive charges of regular size and shape, which gave more controlled explosion pressures. Improvements in the manufacture of gun steel assisted progress, allowing larger chambers capable of withstanding larger charges. Still faced with military hostility Noble argued that Elswick breech-loaders were best for the broadside armament of ships. The services eventually conceded, and about 1881 the new guns and explosive charges were introduced into the navy.<br>
<br>From 1868 the Elswick works had entered an arrangement with Charles Mitchell &amp; Co., shipbuilders, of Walker-on-Tyne, for the building of warships, Rendel's speciality, which left Noble in charge of ordnance and acting head when Rendel became a civil lord of the Admiralty in 1881. Armstrong and Mitchell amalgamated in 1882 with Noble, the largest shareholder, as vice-chairman. The company became Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co. Ltd, and Noble, then aged seventy, became chairman on Armstrong's death in December 1900.<br>
<br>The Elswick company had been exceedingly profitable under Noble's influence from the 1880s. Noble combined scientific ability with administrative powers. He had controlled a large business, was in daily attendance at his office or workshops, and actively supervised every detail. Despite opposing the Nine Hours League and the 1871 engineers' strike, he had achieved great success. After his day's work he had continued his technical studies in his library or laboratory, often far into the night. Nevertheless, he thoroughly enjoyed many recreations, including real tennis, fishing, and shooting. His hospitality was unbounded. He had a happy home life and his houses were the centre of large gatherings of relations and friends. However, the company went into relative decline early in the twentieth century. Noble had become unimaginative and conservative in engineering design, autocratic in dealing with his managers, and dynastic in his approach to his succession&#151;two of his four sons, Saxton and John, became directors of the company.<br>
<br>Recognized as the leading authority, Noble acted on numerous committees dealing with guns and gunpowder. He took little share in public life; he published his researches through the learned societies. In many experiments he collaborated with Sir Frederick Augustus Abel, and two of his most important papers (in 1875 and 1879) were published in their joint names in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. In 1906 he reprinted his papers and lectures in the volume <span class="italic">Artillery and Explosives</span>.<br>
<br>Noble was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1870, was made a CB in 1881, created a KCB in 1893, and a baronet in 1902. He was a vice-president of the Institution of Naval Architects in 1900, and its honorary vice-president from 1905. He was also the recipient of many scientific honours and foreign decorations including the royal medal of the Royal Society (1880) and the Albert medal of the Royal Society of Arts (1909). At the end of 1911 he ceased active management of the business, but remained chairman. About 1905 he bought the Callendar estate of Ardkinglas by Loch Fyne, Argyll, Scotland, and in the house which Sir Robert Lorimer designed for him there he died on 22 October 1915. He was buried at Cairndow on the estate. The baronetcy was inherited by his eldest son, George John William Noble (1859&#150;1937), while the Ardkinglas estate passed to his third son, John Henry Brunel Noble (1865&#150;1938), who was made a baronet in his own right in 1923.<br>
