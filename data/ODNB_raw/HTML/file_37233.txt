<span class="headword">Browne,  Frances</span>  (1816&#150;1879), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 16 January 1816 in Stranorlar, co. Donegal, the seventh of twelve children of Samuel Brown, the village postmaster. She lost her sight following smallpox at the age of eighteen months. The family was Presbyterian, and her conscious effort to acquire an education began at the age of six, when she heard a sermon she could not understand. From that time she adopted a plan for acquiring information through asking the meaning of every new word she heard. She also learned by listening to her siblings repeating their lessons. She had a thirst for facts and a tenacious memory, and bribed members of her family to read &#145;the drier, but more instructive books&#146; which she latterly preferred, though in rural Ireland books of any kind were hard to come by.<br>
<br>Three early poems were published in the <span class="italic">Irish Penny Journal</span> (1840), and this volume was the first book Browne ever possessed. Encouraged, in 1841 she sent poems to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, and later to <span class="italic">Hood's Magazine</span> and to Marguerite, countess of Blessington, for <span class="italic">Keepsake</span>. A volume of poems, <span class="italic">The Star of Att&eacute;ghei</span>, was published in 1844. With her literary earnings she paid for the education of a young sister, who became her amanuensis and moved to Edinburgh with her in 1847. In 1852 they moved to London.<br>
<br>Browne made what would seem to have been a precarious living as a journalist, contributing poetry, reviews, and articles on contemporary issues to the <span class="italic">Leisure Hour</span>, <span class="italic">Sunday at Home</span>, <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span>, <span class="italic">Tait's Magazine</span>, and other periodicals. Between 1860 and 1866 she made three successful applications for money from the Royal Literary Fund, whose archives give details. Early in her career Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, third marquess of Lansdowne, had given her a generous sum; she also received grants from the Royal Bounty Fund and a pension from the civil list.<br>
<br>Browne wrote three three-volume novels: <span class="italic">My Share of the World</span> (1861), <span class="italic">The Castleford Case</span> (1862), and <span class="italic">The Hidden Sun</span> (1866). All were set in a wide range of localities, were powerful and dramatic, but lacked organization.<br>
<br>The handful of stories that Browne wrote for children were remarkable for their strong sense of place and feeling for landscapes she had never seen. <span class="italic">The Eriksons</span> (1852), for instance, described Norwegian life in great detail; &#145;Our Uncle's Story&#146; (<span class="italic">Our Uncle the Traveller's Stories</span>, 1859) was set in the Black Forest, two others in the Lincolnshire fens and in southern Africa respectively. None of her books was reprinted in her lifetime, not even <span class="italic">Granny's Wonderful Chair</span> (1857), a collection of seven fairy-tales within a frame story, owing something to Grimm. It is for this book, her only attempt at fantasy, that she is remembered. Although it achieved classic status, it did not become generally known until the late Victorian period, when Frances Hodgson Burnett, who had read the book as a child, retold part of it from memory in <span class="italic">St Nicholas</span> in 1887, and the proper text was &#145;rediscovered&#146;. Frances Browne died from apoplexy at her home, 19 St John's Grove, Richmond, Surrey, on 21 August 1879. She was unmarried.<br>
