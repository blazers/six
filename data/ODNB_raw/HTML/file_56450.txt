<span class="headword">Bury <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Falkner]</span>,  Priscilla Susan</span>  (1799&#150;1872), <span class="occ">botanical artist</span>, was born on 12 January 1799 in Rainhill, Lancashire, the daughter of Edward Dean Falkner (1750&#150;1825), a wealthy Liverpool trader, who had been high sheriff of Lancashire in 1788, and his wife, Bridgett Tarleton (<i>d</i>. 1819), only daughter of John Tarleton, merchant and shipowner; Priscilla Falkner was named after her maternal grandmother, Susan Precilla Bertie.<br>
<br>Priscilla Falkner drew plants raised in the greenhouses of her family home, Fairfield (demolished 1913), 2 miles east of Liverpool and, by 1829, had enough studies of lilies and allied plants for publication, a venture promoted by her friend, William Swainson. She modelled her proposed book, then tentatively named &#145;Drawings of lilies&#146;, on William Roscoe's <span class="italic">Monandrian Plants</span> (1824&#150;8), with the plates to be accompanied by brief letterpresses based on her notes. Indeed, she even used Roscoe's book prospectus as a model for her own. In it, she advertised her &#145;Drawings of Liliaceous Plants arranged by Botanists in the genera Crinum, Amaryllis, Pancratium &hellip;&#146;, to appear in ten numbers, each of five plates to be lithographed by Hullmandel, subscribers paying a guinea a number, others 27<i>s</i>.<br>
<br>On 4 March 1830, at Walton on the Hill, Priscilla Falkner married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4149/', "Edward Bury (1794&#150;1858)")</script>, a railway engineer; the couple had at least three sons, born between 1831 and 1835. In 1831 Priscilla Bury's drawings began to be published as <span class="italic">A Selection of Hexandrian Plants</span>, the large (64 cm &times; 48 cm) plates being engraved by Robert Havell; the work had only seventy-nine subscribers. Fifty-one plates appeared in ten fascicles, the last in 1834, but whether or not the text is Bury's is unclear. The plates are fine-grained aquatints, partly printed in colour and retouched by hand: the original drawings later went to Dumbarton Oaks, Washington. The published work has been praised as &#145;certainly one of the most effective colour-plate folios of its period&#146;  (Blunt and Stearn, 248).<br>
<br>After 1836 Priscilla Bury contributed eight plates to (originals now in NHM) Maund and Henslow's <span class="italic">The Botanist</span> and, in 1860&#150;1, brought out <span class="italic">Figures of Remarkable Forms of polycystins, or Allied Organisms, in the Barbados Chalk deposit</span>, with twelve plates of photographic prints of drawings made from microscopic preparations mounted by Christopher Johnson (1782&#150;1866) of Lancaster, from specimens collected by John Davy (1790&#150;1868). About 1865 there was a second edition with twenty-four plates with a photograph of diatoms by Bury and she seems to have issued further separate plates. M. C. Cooke (1825&#150;1914) brought out another edition in 1869 and that included another plate of diatoms, signed P. S. Bury 1869.<br>
<br>In 1860 Priscilla Bury issued a memoir of her husband, <span class="italic">Recollections of Edward Bury</span>, privately published by John Garnett of Windermere, and by 1866 she was living at Fairfield, Thornton Heath, Croydon. She died at Fairfield, of bronchitis and cerebral congestion, on 8 March 1872.<br>
