<span class="headword">Bowden,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1750), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, may have been the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3026/', "Samuel Bowden (fl. 1733&#150;1761)")</script>, physician and poet, of Frome, Somerset, but he also has been identified by Walter Wilson with the Bowden who studied under Henry Grove at Taunton. This is apparently an error, however, for Bowden was settled at Frome before 1700 as assistant to Humphrey Philips, who had been silenced at Sherborne, Dorset, in 1662, whereas Grove did not set up his academy until 1706. Bowden became sole minister on Philips's death in 1707, and the meeting-house in Rook Lane was built for him that year. According to Evans's list he had 1000 hearers in 1717, among whom was Elizabeth Rowe, the dissenting poet, whose funeral sermon he preached in 1737. Bowden himself was a poet: although he does not seem to have published any separate volume of poetry, he contributed two poems to the collection of <span class="italic">Divine Hymns and Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1704) by Philomela (probably Elizabeth Rowe) and &#145;several other ingenious persons&#146;. During the last nine years of his ministry Bowden was assisted by Alexander Houston (1741), Samuel Blyth (1742), Samuel Perrott, and Josiah Corrie (1750), who succeeded him.<br>
<br>Bowden published four separate sermons, including <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached at Taunton before an Assembly of Ministers</span> (1714). With its provocative emphasis on reason, individual judgement, and moral duties, the sermon clearly demonstrates his support for the ideas of the most liberal wing of dissent, which developed into the non-subscribing party after the Salters' Hall controversy. His &#145;Exhortation&#146; at the ordination of Thomas Morgan was published in 1717, together with the sermon preached on the occasion, &#145;The conduct of ministers&#146;, by Nicholas Billingsley, minister of Ashwick, Somerset. Henry Chandler, minister at Bath and father of Samuel Chandler, added a preface to the work which was published under the title <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached at the Ordination of Mr Thomas Morgan</span>, and this reached a third edition in 1719. Morgan was Independent minister at Bruton, Somerset, and afterwards at Marlborough, Wiltshire, and an active pamphleteer for the non-subscribers' cause. After being forced from his ministry for heresy, he published the notorious deist work <span class="italic">The Moral Philosopher</span> (1737). That Morgan, an Independent, went to Frome for Presbyterian ordination has been treated as an indication of the theological divergence of the two bodies, but Bowden's confession of faith appears strongly trinitarian and Calvinistic. It does, however, reveal a fascination with Newtonian science, which suggests his receptivity to the latest intellectual trends.<br>
<br>Bowden's involvement with the future deist Morgan, and with the Arian Billingsley, who sheltered the heterodox Hubert Stogdon and James Foster at his home, provides a clue to his own sympathies. In 1718 he was to participate, again with Billingsley, in the more controversial ordination of Stogdon himself at Shepton Mallet, when it appeared that the Exeter assembly would not approve him. Bowden and Billingsley were greatly blamed by the orthodox ministers in Devon for their involvement in this affair, which prompted a flurry of anxious letters to London lamenting the defection of many younger ministers to Arianism. The controversy culminated in the Salters' Hall debates. Underlying the willingness of Bowden and Billingsley to flout the orthodoxy imposed by the subscription party was a more fundamental commitment to scripture as the only rule of faith, and a consequent antipathy to that &#145;tyrannical, anti-Christian tenet&#146; which allowed any men to &#145;domineer and dictate in matters of conscience&#146; (Billingsley, <span class="italic">Sermon &hellip; Hubert Stogdon</span>, 32; J. Bowden, <span class="italic">Sermon Preached at Taunton</span>, 1714, 24). For them, the partisan divisions engendered by the imposition of human creeds threatened to undermine Christianity itself. Bowden also worked closely with Nicholas Billingsley's nephew and eventual successor at Ashwick, Samuel Billingsley, whose ordination sermon he preached in 1725; this was printed for another Somerset friend, Samuel Chandler, then a bookseller, as well as a minister, in London. Bowden's sermon <span class="italic">The Vanity of All Human Dependence</span> (1727) was dedicated to the liberal (and heterodox) Benjamin Avery, to whom he was under &#145;particular obligations&#146;.<br>
<br>Bowden died in Frome on 8 January 1750. A tablet on the front of his meeting-house commemorates him as &#145;a learned man, an eloquent preacher, and a considerable poet&#146;. Subsequent lines refer to rising &#145;storms about the good man&#146;, which may allude to a Trinitarian secession from his ministry, a charge given weight by Josiah Thompson, who wrote that the meeting at Frome divided as a result of disputes under Bowden's ministry (James, 676; Thompson, fol. 176<i>r</i>). Little is known of Bowden's family except that his wife survived him. In January 1750 one Anne Yerbury of Bradford sent his widow a consolatory letter praising Bowden's poetical powers. Bowden was possibly the grandfather of Joseph Bowden, minister at Call Lane, Leeds, for over forty years, from about 1778, who published <span class="italic">Sermons Delivered to the Protestant Dissenters at Leeds</span> and <span class="italic">Prayers and Discourses for the Use of Families, in Two Parts</span> (1816).<br>
