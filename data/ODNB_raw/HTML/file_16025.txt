<span class="headword">Langley,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1657), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, was born in or near Banbury, Oxfordshire, and probably attended the grammar school there; his parents' names are unknown. In 1612 he was admitted to Magdalen Hall, Oxford, as a commoner, subscribing on 23 April 1613; he graduated BA on 5 July 1616 and proceeded MA on 24 April 1619. In 1616 Langley had been appointed usher of the King's School, Gloucester, and on 9 March 1618 was promoted to the headmastership. Although, as later became apparent, he was opposed to the prevailing regime of William Laud as dean of Gloucester, he was well regarded by the subsequent dean, Thomas Winniffe, and his chapter. In December 1627 Langley resigned to move to a better-paid post at Dorchester, but the Gloucester city fathers offered him an additional &pound;10 p.a. to stay, and with the further encouragement of the cathedral authorities he was reinstated on 11 August 1628. It is possible that he had objected to teaching the choristers in the King's School, since on his return other arrangements were made for them. When Sir Nathaniel Brent visited the cathedral on behalf of Archbishop Laud in June 1635 Langley was threatened with suspension for refusing the oath; sentence was deferred because although he was (rightly) suspected of puritanism he was recognized as &#145;a very good schoolmaster&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1635</i>, 40). Langley was nevertheless replaced by November. On 19 September 1639 the city council, who had found the master of the Crypt School, which they controlled, to be generally negligent and to have sent few scholars to the universities, appointed Langley usher and teacher of Greek, as he had &#145;given good testimony in teaching and instructing many of the burgesses sonnes of this citye and others and inabling them for the universities&#146;  (Glos. RO, GBR 3/2, 132). On 27 September they withdrew the appointment as usher, but confirmed Langley as teacher of Greek and &#145;other learninge&#146;  (ibid., 134). But when in 1640 there was a prospect of his becoming headmaster of this school, the king directly intervened to forbid it. A privy seal letter of 22 April, undoubtedly framed by Laud, condemned the city's &#145;attempt to bring in &hellip; a man factiously sett agaynst the government of the Church of England&#146;, who had &#145;deserted&#146; the dean and chapter's school after refusing to conform  (ibid., 148).<br>
<br>But Langley's connections soon helped him to a better prize; Winniffe was now dean of St Paul's, and on 30 December 1640 he and the earl of Middlesex nominated Langley for the high mastership of St Paul's School. Among three short-listed candidates Langley was judged &#145;extraordinary&#146;, and he was duly elected on 7 January 1641  (McDonnell, 171). He went on to achieve great renown both within his school and without. On 20 June 1643 the Commons committed to him (and his old adversary Brent) the licensing of books in philosophy, history, morality, and the arts; the stationers would claim in 1648 that his school work impeded performance of these duties. He himself published during this period <span class="italic">Totius rhetoricae adumbratio</span> (1644), for his scholars at St Paul's. The same year he provided evidence at the trial of Laud, instancing ritualistic practices introduced into Gloucester Cathedral during his decanate. He also alleged that, as primate, Laud had persecuted the Gloucester lecturer John Workman (whose brother Giles had been Langley's under-master at the King's School).<br>
<br>On 25 December 1644 Langley preached before the Commons in St Margaret's, Westminster. He retained a connection with Gloucester, being in 1656 appointed one of the collectors for repair of the cathedral. He died at his house in London on 13 September 1657 and was buried on the 21st at the Mercers' chapel, Cheapside, when Edward Reynolds preached in praise of his great and diverse learning. Langley left &pound;30 to the Mercers' Company, &pound;20 to the city of Gloucester to provide short-term loans to young tradesmen, &pound;10 to Pembroke College, Oxford, to rebuild its derelict premises, and more than thirty individual bequests to London ministers and merchants. He was unmarried, and of close family his will mentions only his nieces Mary and Ann. He is said to have had &#145;a very awfull presence and speech&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.435) which, however, softened on acquaintance.<br>
