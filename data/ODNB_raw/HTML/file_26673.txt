<span class="headword">Strode,  Ralph</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1387), <span class="occ">scholastic philosopher and lawyer</span>, is of unknown origins. His name is first found in the records for 1359 and 1360 of Merton College, Oxford (a college predominantly but not entirely of southerners), where he was then fellow. The bursar's roll for 1361 is missing, and he might still have been a fellow then. He had evidently become acquainted with John Wyclif (<i>d</i>. 1384) while at Oxford, a fact of which Wyclif reminded him at the time of a theological controversy in which they took opposite sides. This could place Strode there as early as 1355, the earliest date at which Wyclif might have entered Merton, although since Wyclif was master of Balliol from 1360, their later meeting would have been almost inevitable. No more specific details of Strode's life are known before his election as common serjeant or pleader&#151;effectively public prosecutor&#151;of the city of London, on 25 November 1373, an office he held until 1382.<br>
<br>In London, Strode occupied a mansion over Aldersgate from 27 October 1375 to 4 May 1386, when he received an annuity of 4 marks in compensation for his life tenancy. During his period of office he had further dealings with former Merton colleagues. In 1374, jointly with Wyclif, he acted as surety for a former fellow of the college, Master Richard Benger, then rector of Donington, Berkshire. Three years later he likewise acted jointly with the former fellow Master Robert Rygge on behalf of John Bloxham, warden of the college, in a dispute between the king and the college over the ownership of land in Oxford. In 1381, with his neighbour and friend the poet Geoffrey Chaucer (<i>d</i>. 1400), he went surety for John Hende, a merchant destined to become mayor of London after Strode's death.<br>
<br>The pattern of Strode's career has led some to argue that the philosopher and lawyer were two persons of the same name. One argument is that the lawyer was married&#151;he was survived by a wife, Emma, a son Ralph, and possibly a daughter Margery. If the scholar Strode had quit Merton for London, and was not a religious, marriage was not out of order. The more common argument for two Strodes is that no one man of the time would have had such diverse professional interests, but there are many contemporaries whose lives show this to be simply untrue. As common serjeant he would have needed knowledge normally only procured in the London inns of court, but in view of the large lacuna in his known career it would be foolish to suggest that the schoolman could not have acquired that readily enough.<br>
<br>About 1385 Chaucer dedicated his <span class="italic">Troilus and Criseyde</span>&#151;where he treats skilfully of the problem of free will and predestination&#151;to the poet John Gower and the scholar Strode:<blockquote>
<div>O moral Gower, this book I directe<br>
</div>
<div>To the, and to the, philosophical Strode,<br>
</div>
<div>To vouchen sauf, ther nede is, to correcte,<br>
</div>
<div>Of youre benignites and zeles goode.<br>
</div> (G. Chaucer, <span class="italic">Troilus and Criseyde</span>, v. 1857&#150;9)</blockquote>Chaucer uses the word &#145;philosophical&#146; of academic philosophy, often natural philosophy. The Merton connections of the lawyer Strode whom Chaucer knew, and the epithet &#145;philosophical&#146; that here suggests a university man of some standing, in juxtaposition to a reference to another friend as &#145;moral&#146;, all speak for the identity of lawyer and Mertonian.<br>
<br>It was in connection with Wyclif's <span class="italic">De civili dominio</span> that Strode took issue with this increasingly controversial schoolman, the <i>flos Oxonie</i>. Strode's own side of the seemingly amicable debate was set down in a work that a college document calls simply <span class="italic">Positiones contra Wiclevum</span>, known only through Wyclif's replies, since printed as <span class="italic">Responsiones ad decem questiones magistri R. Strode</span> and <span class="italic">Responsiones ad argumenta Radulphi Strode</span>. Strode rejected Wyclif's view of predestination, believing that it implied that man cannot act freely, and so cannot have responsibility or indeed hope of salvation. In ecclesiastical matters he took a pragmatic position: harmony and concord in the church was so important as to demand a moderate toleration of abuses. While his own views are known only through the veil of Wyclif's texts, it is clear that Strode experienced many of the ecclesiastical and political uncertainties of the age.<br>
<br>While Chaucer brought Strode's name to the notice of his fellow countrymen, his own scholastic writings earned him a reputation in Italy. This was largely brought about by the Augustinian friar Paulo da Venezia (<i>d</i>. 1429), who spent at least three years in Oxford after 1390, before returning to teach at Padua. Later commentaries on Strode were written by such Paduans as Paolo da Pergola and Gaetano da Thiene, students of Paulo; and when the sixteenth-century writer Matteo Bossi wished to contrast scholasticism with ancient philosophy, he said he seemed to hear not Plato, Aristotle, and Theophrastus but &#145;your Burleys, Pauls of Venice, or Strodi&#146;  (Thorndike, 238). Strode's <span class="italic">Logica</span> was written in or not long after 1359. It comprises six parts, which were often copied as independent works. The sections on <span class="italic">Consequentiae</span> and <span class="italic">Obligationes</span> were required texts in the University of Padua and several other universities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Both were printed in several editions. The earlier parts were <span class="italic">De arte logica</span>, <span class="italic">De principiis logicalibus</span>, and <span class="italic">De suppositionibus</span>, while <span class="italic">De insolubilibus</span> ended the series, if not in Strode's intentions, at least in the sole surviving manuscript of the complete collection. At many points he echoed other Mertonians [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95034', "Merton calculators")</script>]. He paraphrased Bradwardine's survey (1321&#150;4) of the literature of insolubles, for example, and showed an awareness of the arguments of Swineshead, Heytesbury, Fland, and Billingham. He followed Bradwardine on the question of whether an individual says anything at all in uttering an insoluble like the self-referential paradox &#145;I am lying&#146;. (Both argued that to say this was not to say nothing, for those words were being spoken.) He did not hide his admiration for Bradwardine, whom he described as the &#145;prince of the modern philosophers of nature &hellip; who was the first to hit upon something worthwhile concerning insolubles&#146;  (Ashworth and Spade, 38). On obligations, the rules of disputation that according to Heytesbury must be used to provide a context for insolubles, Strode disagreed on various points with him, and with Swineshead too. In his text on consequences he took the same line as Ockham had done, and treated them as what would now be known as material consequences, that is, not necessarily involving a relationship between the logical forms of antecedent and consequent. He spoke of consequences as inferences, valid or invalid, but was also capable of treating them as true or false, as though they were propositions.<br>
<br>Although Merton College was a centre of activity in natural philosophy and astronomy, Strode has left no writings on either subject. A fifteenth-century note, added to a manuscript copy of Chaucer's treatise on the astrolabe, claims that he wrote it for his son who was at the time under the tutelage of the most noble philosopher Master N. Strode. Some have chosen to read the initial as an &#145;R&#146;. The only value of this note is that it might hint very distantly at a tradition that Strode put Chaucer in touch with Oxford astronomy. A marginal note in the <span class="italic">Catalogus vetus</span> of Merton College describes Strode (with the Christian name added later as &#145;Rad.&#146;) in these words: &#145;nobilis poeta fuit et versificavit librum elegiacum vocatum <i>Fantasma Radulphi</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pearl</span>, xlvi&#150;xlix). Israel Gollancz took this to be a reference to the poem <span class="italic">Pearl</span>, an unwarranted claim, although the identity of <span class="italic">Pearl's</span> author&#151;someone who wrote in a west midlands dialect&#151;is still far from certain.<br>
<br>Strode died in London in 1387, judging by a record of his will, now lost.<br>
