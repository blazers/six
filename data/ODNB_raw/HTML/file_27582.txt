<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tourneur,  Cyril</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1626), <span class="occ">writer and soldier</span>, is of obscure origins. It seems possible that he was either a son of Edward Tournor of Canons, Great Parndon, Essex, and his second wife, Frances Baker (<i>d</i>. 1600), or (less likely) a grandson, his father, also named Edward (1559&#150;1623), a barrister of the Middle Temple, being a son of Tournor's first marriage. What suggests this (summarized by Nicoll, 2&#150;4) is twofold. First, both Cyril Tourneur and a Captain Richard Turnor, of Canons, brother of the younger Edward Tournor, were closely associated with Sir Francis Vere and with the Cecil family: Richard Turnor serving in the Low Countries under Sir Thomas Cecil (later earl of Exeter) and Sir Francis Vere, and Cyril Tourneur under Vere and Sir Edward Cecil, later Viscount Wimbledon, third son of Sir Thomas. Second, Cyril is an exceedingly rare name in Elizabethan England, and the Tournor / Tourneur family (whose name was variously spelt, as was Cyril Tourneur's) were given to naming their children unusually as the unfortunately incomplete parish register of Great Parndon indicates: thus Nicoll  (pp. 4&#150;5) lists, among others, a Maurice, a Joshua, a Lydia, and a Demetrius.<h2>
<a name="Earlyliterarycareer"></a>Early literary career</h2>The little that is known of Tourneur's life indicates two aspects to his career: literary and military. He first appears in 1600 as author of <span class="italic">The Transformed Metamorphosis</span>, an obscurely allegorical poem about the state of the arts in England. Showing the influence of Edmund Spenser and John Marston, the poem is in some respects obscure, and there has been considerable debate  (see Schuman, 41&#150;6) over the identification of the island of Delta, almost certainly England, and of the figure of Mavortio, most plausibly Henry VIII. But the general drift seems clear enough: Mavortio rid Delta of the corruption of Roman Catholicism, and under his protection &#145;<i>Mars</i> and the Muses had their dignity&#146;. After Mavortio's death, however, corruption set in once more and the muses were reinfected, with &#145;<i>Nilus Crocodiles</i> &hellip; bathing in the pure <i>Castalian</i> head&#146;  (548&#150;9). But in the last four of the poem's eighty-seven stanzas, the rock of truth on which the poet has taken refuge metamorphoses into Eliza (Elizabeth I), who effects a new metamorphosis. Tourneur's &#145;Epilogue&#146;, with its emphatic contrast between now, when<blockquote>
<div>Heav'ns sacred lights agree in one consent<br>
</div>
<div>To drive the cloudes from foorth the firmament<br>
</div> (13&#150;14)</blockquote>and the dark night of the soul in which he originally wrote, suggests that circumstances might have changed before the poem's publication, with a call for reform somehow transformed into a statement of hope, perhaps by an event such as the calling in and burning by the ecclesiastical authorities in June 1599 of satiric and erotic works by Marston and others.<br>
<br>Following <span class="italic">The Transformed Metamorphosis</span> nothing certain is heard of Tourneur until 1609, with the publication of his <span class="italic">Funerall Poeme upon the Death of the most Worthy and True Souldier, Sir Francis Vere</span>, but two works published in the interim have with varying degrees of confidence been attributed to him. <span class="italic">Laugh and Lie Downe</span> (1605) is a prose pamphlet in the dream-vision tradition, in which C. T. exposes folly in such figures as the lover, the henpecked husband, the profligate, the soldier, and the whore. In its didacticism it sorts well with works undoubtedly by Tourneur. Whether <span class="italic">The Revenger's Tragedy</span> (1607) was also Tourneur's has long been debated. Published anonymously, it was first attributed to him in a play list of 1656, and until recently it constituted his chief claim to fame, since of its kind&#151;a tragedy of blood shot through with black comedy, which indeed employs many of the techniques of comedy in presenting a fierce critique of revenge and revengers, along with a bitter expos&eacute; of court corruption&#151;it is a masterpiece. There now, however, appears to be an overwhelming case for the authorship of Thomas Middleton. The earlier balance of pro-Tourneur and pro-Middleton articles was based on impressionistic assessments, on parallels, and on literary judgement  (see Schuman, 62&#150;76), but these approaches have given way to an impressive series of analyses, computer-assisted since the 1970s, of the language of <span class="italic">The Revenger's Tragedy</span>, and its likeness to that of Middleton (see Lake, 136&#150;57, and Jackson, 33&#150;40 and 161&#150;8).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A Funerall Poeme upon the Death of &hellip; Sir Francis Vere</span> is a plain but eulogistic memorial to a great soldier. It displays a close knowledge of Vere's methods of command, and it shrewdly analyses what made them so successful, but Tourneur's primary focus is on the man, and on the personal qualities that marked him as exceptional. &#145;His <i>Minde</i>&#146;, Tourneur writes, &#145;was like an <i>Empire</i>, <i>rich</i> and <i>strong</i>&#146;: he was modest, temperate in judgement, and flexible in his approach to commanding men, and waging war. It is this, for Tourneur, that makes Vere great.<h2>
<a name="TheAtheistsTragedy"></a>The Atheist's Tragedy</h2>In 1611 there appeared Tourneur's first (as it now seems) play, <span class="italic">The Atheist's Tragedy</span>. Strongly didactic, it demonstrates in terms both comic&#151;the subplot involving Levidulcia and Sebastian&#151;and serious, the fatal implications of atheism (embodied in the villainous D'Amville), and the rewards that accompany a patient adherence (by the hero, Charlemont) to Christian principles. As with <span class="italic">The Transformed Metamorphosis</span> it may be that Tourneur is responding to a particular stimulus, in this case <span class="italic">The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois</span> by George Chapman. For, as H. H. Adams has argued  (&#145;Cyril Tourneur on revenge&#146;, <span class="italic">Journal of English and Germanic Philology</span>, 48, 1949, 82&#150;6), Charlemont, the hero who refuses to revenge, seems to be a remodelling in Christian terms of Chapman's Clermont, who likewise abstains from revenge, but on Stoic principles. Clifford Leech, taking the case further, suggests  (&#145;<i>The Atheist's Tragedy</i> as a dramatic comment on Chapman's <i>Bussy</i> plays&#146;, <span class="italic">Journal of English and Germanic Philology</span>, 52, 1953, 525&#150;30) that D'Amville, Tourneur's supreme atheist, may be based on Chapman's Bussy, whose surname he echoes.<br>
<br>Viewed realistically, the principal characters in <span class="italic">The Atheist's Tragedy</span> seem somewhat stiff and lifeless, but as dramatic exempla they serve Tourneur's purposes well. The ending, in which D'Amville brains himself as he attempts to execute Charlemont, marks the summation of the non-naturalistic mode that <span class="italic">The Atheist's Tragedy</span> employs. It is unfortunate that there has been only one modern production to test the dramatic viability of Tourneur's one undoubted surviving play, since it might well succeed if sympathetically produced. There is no shortage of dramatically effective scenes, and plenty of humour, associated particularly with the hypocritical tallow-chandler turned preacher, Languebeau Snuffe.<h2>
<a name="Laterliterarycareer"></a>Later literary career</h2>Hard on the heels, it seems, of <span class="italic">The Atheist's Tragedy</span> came Tourneur's second play, a tragicomedy entitled <span class="italic">The Nobleman</span>. Ironically, given that it has not survived, save for a single piece of incidental music, more is known about the stage history of <span class="italic">The Nobleman</span> than about any other play with which Tourneur is associated. Performances at court by the King's Men were recorded on 23 February 1612 and at Christmas of that year, and the play was still in the repertory of the company in 1641  (Bentley, 1.65&#150;6).<br>
<br>The death on 24 May 1612 of the great Robert Cecil provided the occasion for Tourneur's prose <span class="italic">Character of Robert Earle of Salesburye</span>, probably written for the family and never published, though extant in five manuscript copies. The <span class="italic">Character</span> demonstrates close personal knowledge of Cecil, such as the ruin to which devotion to affairs of state nearly brought him&#151;ruin from which he was rescued by the good management of his steward. The importance of Cecil's service to the realm is declared, but as in the elegy on Sir Francis Vere, Tourneur is more interested in praising his subject's character: his generosity, prudence, self-control, and denial of self in the interests of the state. It is a moral summation of the man, rather than an account of his statesmanship, and accordingly it stresses Cecil's religious faith declared (as Tourneur must have known) in his will, and his peaceful end, in the tradition of the &#145;good death&#146;.<br>
<br>Later in 1612 another death, that of Henry, prince of Wales, occasioned deep national grief. Tourneur was one of many poets who marked the event, his <span class="italic">A Griefe on the Death of Prince Henrie</span>, published in January 1613, appearing both separately and with elegies by John Webster and Thomas Heywood. In <span class="italic">A Griefe</span> Tourneur again dwells on the personal and the moral. Without ignoring the loss to the realm&#151;indeed including a poem &#145;On the Succession&#146;, in which he develops the imprudent conceit of Henry's dying in order to simplify and thus strengthen the succession to the throne, a poem deleted from most surviving copies of the elegy&#151;he makes Henry's death the occasion for what Ruth Wallerstein  (<span class="italic">Studies in Seventeenth Century Poetic</span>, 1950, 84) calls &#145;spiritual drama&#146;, in which the death of the exemplification of Virtue exposes the world for the worthless thing it is, and in which the primary focus is on Henry's exemplary life and death.<br>
<br>The final literary record relating to Tourneur is a mention in a letter written in June 1613 by Robert Daborne to Philip Henslowe, the theatrical entrepreneur, that he had &#145;given Cyrill Tourneur an act of the Arreignment of london to write&#146;  (W. W. Greg, <span class="italic">The Henslowe Papers</span>, 1907, 72). If completed, the play has not survived. It may have been based on <span class="italic">The Bellman of London</span>, a prose pamphlet by Thomas Dekker. Though there are no records to support the supposition, it is possible that in the same year, 1613  (see Chambers, 3.227), Tourneur may also have been collaborating on another, extant play, <span class="italic">The Honest Man's Fortune</span>, this time with Nathan Field and John Fletcher. Gerritsen argued Tourneur's authorship of the first four scenes (assigned by Hoy, 100&#150;08, to Field), and Jackson  (pp. 216&#150;20) has strongly supported the case for Tourneur's part-authorship of the tragicomedy, which has as its hero a paragon of Christian patience akin to Charlemont, and a title intriguingly like the subtitle of <span class="italic">The Atheist's Tragedy</span>, &#145;The Honest Man's Revenge&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Militarycareer"></a>Military career</h2>The remaining records relating to Tourneur all concern military or diplomatic activity. On 23 December 1613 Tourneur was granted &pound;10 for &#145;his chardges and paines in carrying letters for his Ma<sup>ts</sup> service to Brussels&#146;  (Cunningham, xliii); in August 1614 he is mentioned in a letter written from Nijmegen by James Bathurst as having been there and at Brussels, but now &#145;gone to the army with his Colonel&#146;  (J. R. Sutherland, &#145;Cyril Tourneur&#146;, <span class="italic">TLS</span>, 16 April 1931, 307). In 1617 he was, for unknown reasons, arrested on the order of the privy council, but he was shortly released on the bond of Sir Edward Cecil. Then, in 1625, Tourneur was appointed secretary to the council of war on the Cadiz expedition, though he was later displaced by a royal appointee. The expedition was a dismal failure, and it returned to Britain with its ships ravaged by fever. One of those put ashore at Kinsale, Ireland, was Cyril Tourneur, who died there on 28 February 1626, leaving a widow, Mary, who petitioned the council of war for a pension, and was supported by Sir Edward Cecil, now the earl of Wimbledon, who attested to her husband's good service.<br>
<br>Since all the records relating to Tourneur's literary activity predate those concerning his military and diplomatic service, it may appear that he lived a life in two halves, literary and then military, but there is fortunately enough in the later documentary evidence to contradict this. Bathurst's letter, for instance, relates that &#145;Mr Cirrill Turner &hellip; belongs to General Cecil and was in former times Secretary to Sir Francis Vere&#146;, thus confirming that he was in the Low Countries in the first years of the seventeenth century, and may even have been in the service of Vere as early as the Cadiz expedition of 1598. That he served long and well in the Netherlands is also attested by Mary Tourneur's statement in her petition that her husband &#145;heretofore was ymployed under the States of Holland, &amp; had settled meanes of 60<sup>li</sup> p annum by his place, beside the dayly hopes he had of some greater pferment there&#146;  (Nicoll, 31).<h2>
<a name="Literaryreputation"></a>Literary reputation</h2>With the attribution of <span class="italic">The Revenger's Tragedy</span> to Middleton, Tourneur's literary standing has shrunk markedly. But the loss of what was once regarded as his masterpiece enables modern readers to see him in a clearer light. The author of <span class="italic">The Revenger's Tragedy</span> was long regarded (if wrongly) as cynical and nullifidian, but the Cyril Tourneur of <span class="italic">The Atheist's Tragedy</span>, of the lucid and thoughtful elegies on Sir Francis Vere and Henry, prince of Wales, and of that confusing but powerful outcry against the prostitution of the muses, <span class="italic">The Transformed Metamorphosis</span>, shows himself to be a traditional Christian moralist, with a consistent didactic bent. As such, he has a deserved, if minor, place in English literary history, appropriate to a man who seems to have written for gain only when not employed in his chosen profession of soldier.<br>
