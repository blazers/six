<span class="headword">Monro,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1670, <em>d.</em> 1740), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was baptized in Edinburgh on 19 October 1670, the third son of Sir Alexander Monro (1629&#150;1704), commissary of Stirling, of Bearcrofts, near what later became Grangemouth, Stirlingshire, and his wife, Lillias Eastoun. He was initially apprenticed on 8 April 1687, the start of the Monro family's involvement with medicine, as a servant to William Borthwick, a leading Edinburgh surgeon. Borthwick at that time could not, under existing regulations, take on any new full apprentices. However, Monro became fully apprenticed to him as surgeon in January 1689, largely as a result of his father's influence over the Incorporation of Chirurgians (later the College of Surgeons). He duly completed his apprenticeship in April 1692. On 11 October 1692 he matriculated at the University of Leiden. This experience was to inspire him with an aim to found a faculty of medicine at Edinburgh University, since no university in Britain had a medical school like those on continental Europe.<br>
<br>Monro returned to Scotland in 1694 and the next year became surgeon to Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Belasyse's 22nd (Cheshire) regiment of foot, where he stayed until 1700. However, he was on active service abroad with the regiment only during the summers, spending winters in London, where he probably practised surgery in the hospitals. He then returned to Edinburgh, where he established an apothecary's shop. He became a burgess of the city on 19 August 1702, a precondition of membership of the Incorporation of Chirurgians of Edinburgh, which would enable him to practise surgery within the burgh. He was elected a member on 11 March 1703. Monro was elected as boxmaster (treasurer) to the incorporation from 1708 to 1710 and as deacon (president) from 1712 to 1714. As deacon he had a seat on the town council of Edinburgh, which controlled many aspects of civic life. He was also deacon convener of the trades in Edinburgh and represented the town on the convention of royal burghs of Scotland. Queen Anne died shortly before his term of office as deacon ended in 1714, and he took part in proclaiming George, elector of Hanover, as king, showing his support. Monro was surgeon to the poor in Edinburgh from 1713 to 1720.<br>
<br>Monro married twice; first, in 1694, Jean Forbes (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1710), with whom he had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18964/', "Alexander Monro primus (1697&#150;1767)")</script>; and second, in 1721, Margaret Main, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Crichton. Monro still retained the idea of establishing a medical school in Edinburgh and arranged Alexander's education with the plan that he should play an important role in any such school. Monro told the physicians and surgeons of Edinburgh of &#145;a plan which he had long formed in his own mind, of having the different branches of Physic and Surgery regularly taught at Edinburgh, which was highly approved by them&#146;  (Craig, 361). Early in 1720 Monro used his power in the Incorporation of Chirurgians of Edinburgh &#145;to force the two demonstrators of anatomy to resign in favour of his son, who was appointed by the town Council as professor of anatomy on 29 Jan. 1720&#146;  (Morrell, 50). He also encouraged Charles Alston, one of Alexander's fellow students, to amass a collection of plants and to advertise public lectures in Edinburgh which became known as materia medica. Hence the faculty of medicine of Edinburgh University was born.<br>
<br>Monro died at Carolside, near Earlston, Berwickshire, in 1740.<br>
