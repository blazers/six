<span class="headword">Mainzer,  Joseph</span>  (1801&#150;1851), <span class="occ">music teacher</span>, was born in Trier on 21 October 1801. He was educated as a chorister at Trier Cathedral, and learned to play several instruments. He was employed for a time as an apprentice in the Saarbr&uuml;cken coal mines with a view to becoming an engineer, but was ordained a priest in 1826 and was subsequently made an abb&eacute;. He continued his musical studies and was appointed singing-master at the seminary at Trier, for which he wrote his <span class="italic">Singschule</span> (1831). Forced to leave Germany on account of his political opinions, which originated in his experience of the poor conditions in the mines, Mainzer renounced the priesthood and fled in 1833 to Brussels where he wrote an opera, taught, and acted as musical editor of <span class="italic">L'Artiste</span>. Late the following year he moved to Paris. He gave free singing classes in 1835 and contributed musical articles to various journals. Mainzer's classes attracted hundreds of adult labourers and brought his methods to the attention of a much wider audience, including an English one. In fact, similar classes were set up in London in May 1841 following his arrival there in 1839, the authorities in Paris having banned his classes. A textbook, <span class="italic">Singing for the Million</span> (1841), appeared in numerous editions (the title was apparently taken by Hood as the subject of a humorous poem) and presented his system, which was based on continental &#145;fixed&#146; sol-fa. The classes, in competition with Hullah's, which had themselves been inspired by Mainzer's work in Paris, were also successful. He established the paper <span class="italic">Mainzer's Musical Times</span> soon after he arrived in London, and this became the <span class="italic">Musical Times</span> when taken over by Novello in 1844. In November 1841 Mainzer competed unsuccessfully against Henry Bishop for the chair of music at Edinburgh University. Having settled in Edinburgh, he established classes and published <span class="italic">The Musical Athenaeum</span> (1842) and <span class="italic">Music and Education</span> (1848). About 1848 he moved to Manchester.<br>
<br>Mainzer's compositions, including operas, some church music, songs, and choruses, are insignificant, but his system of teaching singing in classes, although superseded after his death, was highly influential and widespread and greatly assisted the development of music among amateurs. Exhausted by overwork, he died in Manchester on 10 November 1851.<br>
