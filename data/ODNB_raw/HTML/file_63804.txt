<span class="headword">Brockington, Sir  William Allport</span>  (1871&#150;1959), <span class="occ">educational administrator</span>, was born at 62 Constitution Hill, Birmingham, on 18 June 1871, the son of Thomas Alfred Brockington (<i>d</i>. in or before 1898), a gold beater, and his wife, Fanny Allport. Educated at King Edward VI Grammar School, Birmingham, and Mason College, he graduated BA as a London University external candidate with first-class honours in English in 1890, taking an MA in 1893.<br>
<br>After spending the next seven years lecturing at Mason College, Brockington went as principal to the Victoria Institute, Worcester, in 1898, marrying Jessie Mac Geoch (1869/70&#150;1951), daughter of Alexander Mac Geoch, a draper, on 23 August in the same year. In 1903 he was appointed director of education for Leicestershire county council where he stayed for the next forty-four years, becoming, in the process, one of the most distinguished county education officers of the first half of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Brockington's first task when the new local education authority (LEA), created by the 1902 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>, came into being on 1 July 1903 was to centralize the education administration previously undertaken by numerous school boards. Accordingly, by 1915, this had been concentrated in the county education offices with a staff of thirty-eight of whom Brockington was to remain both the only graduate and the only former teacher until his retirement. He next addressed the problem of numerous, small, voluntary church elementary schools inherited by the new authority, replacing them with council schools whenever possible. Nevertheless, in 1915, there were still 189 church schools and only 74 council schools in the county.<br>
<br>In 1917, however, the wartime shortage of teachers gave Brockington the opportunity to begin the restructuring of the county's elementary schools. Showing remarkable diplomacy, he convinced the managers of the church school in the village of Enderby of the wisdom of admitting all the children over eleven, while the council school admitted the juniors, anticipating by a decade the kind of reorganization advocated by the Hadow report of 1926. This policy of &#145;beheading&#146; schools, despite considerable opposition, was vigorously pursued in the inter-war period, in the process of which the county became a pioneer of what later became the secondary modern school.<br>
<br>A plethora of small, uneconomic grammar schools provided a third problem, prompting Brockington to compensate for the authority's lack of Edward VI foundations by creating Edward VII schools at Coalville, Melton Mowbray, and Market Harborough under LEA control. Moreover, suspecting that those children whose families could not pay fees were a source of hitherto untapped ability, he introduced in 1919 a general secondary schools selection examination, taken by all children at eleven, which revealed the need for many more scholarships. Accordingly, despite adverse economic conditions, he managed to keep the number of scholarships fluctuating between 300 and 400 until fees were abolished in 1944. The resultant expansion in the secondary school population, meanwhile, drew all the grammar schools, except the two at Loughborough which remained independent, into the control of the LEA.<br>
<br>In 1914, aged forty-three, Brockington was rejected for military service, serving instead in the Territorial Army, which was fortunate because it enabled him to play a crucial role in launching a most remarkable educational development. In 1915 Herbert Schofield's appointment as principal of Loughborough Technical Institute, established largely on Brockington's initiative in 1909, coincided with an urgent demand for munitions. Seizing their opportunity, Brockington, Schofield, and Alderman Bumpus, chairman of the governors, by personally guaranteeing &pound;1000, secured the establishment of an &#145;instructional factory&#146; in which the Ministry of Munitions invested buildings and machinery worth &pound;150,000, all of which were transferred to the LEA at the end of the war. Thus began the principle of &#145;training on production&#146; which quickly gave Loughborough a national and later an international reputation and the distinction of being the prototype of the colleges of advanced technology designated in 1955.<br>
<br>In 1924 Sir Robert Martin became chairman of both the county council and the education committee, forming, with Schofield and Brockington, a powerful triumvirate intent on expanding the Loughborough concept. Accordingly in 1930 the teacher training college for physical education, art, and craft was added to the embryo campus. By the time Brockington retired in 1947 the constituent components of what was later to become the University of Loughborough were all flourishing.<br>
<br>Brockington, meanwhile, had become a national figure. Serving on the Burnham committee on teachers' salaries from 1919 to 1944, he was a member of the consultative committee to the Board of Education from 1926 until 1944, participating in the production of two Hadow reports, <span class="italic">The Primary School</span> (1931) and <span class="italic">Infant and Nursery Schools</span> (1933), and the Spens report, <span class="italic">Secondary Education</span> (1938), of which he drafted the chapter on administrative problems. He also served on the Secondary Schools Examination Council which produced the Norwood report of 1943. Appointed OBE in 1917, he was made a CBE in 1928, but although he was sixty-five in 1936 his continuing vigour and non-pensionable post left retirement out of the question. Consequently, having previously served as president of the Association of Directors and Secretaries for Education, he was still able to hold the office of honorary secretary of the authorities' panels from 1944 until 1947.<br>
<br>A most humane and approachable individual, Brockington regarded administrative minutiae with disdain. A stickler for economy, he was his own inspector-cum-adviser. As a result it was the local HM inspector, S. C. Mason, who fed into the office much of the information needed for the development plan established by the county following the 1944 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>, and duly succeeded him as director in 1947. Brockington, who was knighted in 1946, died at 3 Owls Road, Boscombe, Bournemouth, on 14 February 1959, his successor having just inaugurated the &#145;Leicestershire plan&#146; of comprehensive education, the foundation for which Brockington had laid.<br>
