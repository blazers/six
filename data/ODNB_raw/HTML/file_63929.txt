<span class="headword">Mulso family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1350&#150;1460), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, of Northamptonshire, must have originated in Mulsoe, Buckinghamshire, but a branch was already established at Newton by Geddington, Northamptonshire, in 1346. <a name="cosubject_63928"></a><span class="headword">Henry [i] Mulso</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1359&#150;1380)<span class="occ"></span> &#145;of Geddington&#146; appears in records over a period of about twenty years as a merchant and shopowner in Thames Street, London, and as a middle-ranking member of the Northamptonshire gentry. His relationship to the next owner of Newton, <a name="cosubject_63929"></a><span class="headword">John [i] Mulso</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1410)<span class="occ"></span> is uncertain, and likewise to his more prominent contemporary <a name="cosubject_63930"></a><span class="headword">William [i] Mulso</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1376)<span class="occ"></span> king's clerk and successor to William Wykeham as surveyor of the works at Windsor in 1361. A canon of St George's Chapel, Windsor, and (again in succession to Wykeham) dean of St Martin's-le-Grand from 1364, William became a chamberlain of the exchequer of receipt in 1365 and ten years later keeper of the king's wardrobe. His close association with the court enabled him to build up a moderately sized estate in Buckinghamshire, adding Chesham and Stoke Poges to his lordship of Mulsoe, which he finally alienated in mortmain before his death in 1376.<br>
<br>The last quarter of the fourteenth century saw the Newton branch of the family achieve some prominence in the person of John [i] Mulso, who was a lawyer with a clientele among the nobility and courtiers of Richard II. As a committed supporter of the king he was entrusted with local offices: JP in 1384, escheator in 1385 and 1391&#150;2, MP in the parliaments of September 1388 and 1397&#150;8, and sheriff in 1393&#150;4, 1395&#150;6, and 1397&#150;9. In August 1397 he&#151;or possibly his namesake (and perhaps his brother), <a name="cosubject_63931"></a><span class="headword">John [ii] Mulso</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1367&#150;1422), who was a <span class="occ">burgess of Calais</span> and household retainer of Thomas (I) Mowbray, earl of Nottingham&#151;was ordered to bring the chief justice, William Rickhill, secretly to Calais to record a forced confession of treason by the duke of Gloucester, held there in Nottingham's custody. In July 1399 he raised men in Northamptonshire to resist the invasion of Henry Bolingbroke, but by 1410 he was dead. After the death of his first wife, Margaret, he married Joan, with whom he is commemorated in a small but beautiful brass in Newton church. He had acquired the manor of Pilton from the executors of his friend Sir William Thorpe in 1391 and had raised the family into the office-holding &eacute;lite of the shire.<br>
<br>John [i] Mulso had three sons: <a name="cosubject_63934"></a><span class="headword">Thomas [i] Mulso</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1446)<span class="occ"></span> with his first wife, <a name="cosubject_63933"></a><span class="headword">Henry [ii] Mulso</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1425)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_63932"></a><span class="headword">John [iii] Mulso</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1416)<span class="occ"></span> with his second. John [iii] made the least mark. In 1401 he married Alice, widow of William Spernore, and two years later they acquired the important manor of Finedon, Northamptonshire, which was devised to their two sons, John [iv] and Thomas [ii], both of whom served in France between 1417 and 1431. John [iii] held no shire office and had died by 1416. By contrast his brother Henry [ii] served as escheator (1395&#150;7) and aulnager (1398&#150;9) in Northamptonshire and used the family's connection with the house of York to become the duke's lieutenant in Jersey and constable of the Tower of London. He served on the duke of Clarence's expedition to Aquitaine in 1412 and at Harfleur in 1415 where, by 1421, he had become lieutenant to Lord Cromwell. He subsequently returned to England to be elected to parliament for Northamptonshire in 1422. By then he was already in the service of Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, and was treasurer of his household by 1423. In November 1424 he was preparing to accompany the duke to Hainault, but by April 1425 he had returned. He made his will on 1 June and died shortly afterward. His marriage to Joan had produced two sons to whom he left his armour, and two unmarried daughters; he asked to be buried in the north aisle of Geddington church, but no monument remains.<br>
<br>It was Thomas [i] Mulso, the eldest and longest-surviving son of John [i], who was to sustain the family's role in the shire in the first quarter of the fifteenth century, serving as sheriff (1409&#150;10) and escheator (1419&#150;20) and being elected to parliament in 1417. He held the Mulso inheritance in Newton, Pilton, and Finedon, and acquired further lands at Little Ocle and at Kettleborough in Suffolk. In 1412 his landed income was assessed at not less than &pound;54 p.a. placing him among the middling gentry. He too probably had some legal competence and was a frequent feoffee and witness for the local gentry and nobility. But after 1422 he held no further offices, occupying himself with his estates, though he did not die until 1446. His will, made in 1439, provided lands for his two younger sons, <a name="cosubject_63935"></a><span class="headword">William [ii] Mulso</span>  (<em>d.</em> after 1461)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_63936"></a><span class="headword">Sir Edmund Mulso</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1458)<span class="occ"></span>, and money for the marriage of their sister Margaret, thereby reducing the full inheritance of <a name="cosubject_63937"></a><span class="headword">Thomas [ii] Mulso</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1460)<span class="occ"></span>, the eldest.<br>
<br>By 1445 this next generation had already undertaken service in France&#151;Thomas [ii] from 1436, under a sequence of professional captains, and Edmund accompanying Richard, duke of York, to Normandy in 1441. There he held captaincies at Lisieux, Neuburg, Pont-Audemer, and Pont-de-l'Arche, received knighthood, and won a place among the select band of ducal counsellors, alongside Sir William Oldhall and Sir Andrew Ogard. After York's return in 1446 Sir Edmund became constable of Fotheringhay Castle and joint steward of Rayleigh, while Thomas [ii], temporarily relinquishing his English lands, became his brother's lieutenant at Pont-de-l'Arche and Elbeuf and York's captain in Bernay. In June 1449 Edmund accompanied the duke to Ireland where he was made seneschal of Meath; when the political crisis of 1450 brought York back from Ireland, all three brothers gave him open support. Edmund and others of the duke's bodyguard were targeted by the court; William [ii] became the duke's retainer with a large fee; and Thomas [ii] returned from France to sit in the parliament of November 1450 alongside Edmund as York's nominees. When in 1451&#150;2 York found himself excluded from the court and forced into armed confrontation, Edmund and Thomas [ii] raised men in Northamptonshire for his march to Dartford where they were probably present.<br>
<br>Although the brothers avoided reprisals like those taken against Oldhall, they remained under a cloud until York's fortunes improved with his first protectorate in 1454. Then, and again in November 1455, Edmund was engaged on diplomatic missions and Thomas [ii] was rewarded with an advantageous lease of the royal manor of Geddington in November 1454. Edmund joined Warwick's garrison at Calais in March 1456 but did not live to face the ultimate test of civil war. He made his will on 1 May 1458, asking to be buried in St Michael Paternoster Royal where he endowed prayers for Richard of York. As his executors he named his brother William [ii] and William Oldhall, who two years later was buried nearby. Though well rewarded for his loyalty to Richard of York, Edmund remained a professional soldier&#150;counsellor and never established himself as a significant landowner.<br>
<br>Thomas's later years were spent managing the Mulso lands in Northamptonshire and Suffolk, cultivating an obscurity which was suddenly terminated by his death on 25 July 1460, two weeks after the battle of Northampton and perhaps as a consequence of it. He left three daughters, one by his first wife, Anne, two by his second, Katherine. His heir, Alice, was already married to Henry Tresham (younger brother of the ardent Lancastrian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27710/', "Sir Thomas Tresham")</script>) to whom all the Mulso estates now passed. When Tresham was killed at the battle of Tewkesbury in 1471 the Mulso lands, by a kind of political justice, escheated to York's son, Edward IV.<br>
<br>In their brief span the Mulsos were never among the leading gentry of Northamptonshire; their modest estates, acquired through local legal practice, were not significantly augmented either by a fortunate marriage of the heir or by service in war which the younger sons had to undertake.<br>
