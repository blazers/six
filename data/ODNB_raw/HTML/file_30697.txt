<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bellman, Sir  (Charles) Harold</span>  (1886&#150;1963), <span class="occ">building society manager</span>, was born in Paddington on 16 February 1886, the second son of Charles Henry Bellman, coach builder, and his wife, Ellen Clemens, both of Cornish origin. After attending a higher-grade school in Kilburn until the age of fourteen he entered the Railway Clearing House near Euston in 1900. An early and lasting cultural influence was Wesleyan Methodism. He also, as a young man, served with the 3rd County of London imperial yeomanry. Bellman's talent for organization became apparent during the First World War, when he served as principal assistant in the establishment department of the Ministry of Munitions.<br>
<br>In 1918, having formed a friendship with Gilbert Lane, secretary of the Abbey Road and St John's Wood Permanent Building Society, he was invited to join its board of management. When Lane died in 1921, Bellman succeeded him as secretary. When Bellman joined the society it was little known outside the borough of Paddington in which it was situated. Bellman studied minutely every aspect of the work&#151;the processes of borrowing and lending, the duties of clerks, cashiers, and surveyors&#151;and made many innovations and improvements. He appointed agents and pioneered a policy of opening branches. He overhauled the publicity, wrote the prospectus himself, and advertised in the national press. Home-ownership through thrift became for him a conviction.<br>
<br>The inter-war years witnessed both rising incomes and a continuing shortage of houses to let, and these conditions led to the growth of the building society movement. There was a strong flow of funds into building societies, not least the Abbey Road. Its assets, which in 1919 were &pound;750,000, rose to &pound;8 million in eight years, and advances rose from about &pound;150,000 to over &pound;3 million.<br>
<br>During these years the board was strengthened by new directors. Sir Josiah Stamp (1880&#150;1941) became president in 1926, and Bellman took great trouble to make the annual meeting a memorable occasion, inviting a prominent person, usually a cabinet minister, to be the chief speaker. In 1932 the society's new building in Baker Street, with its lofty belled tower, was opened by the prime minister, James Ramsay MacDonald. In 1944 the society merged with the National Society to form the Abbey National, with assets of &pound;80 million and Bellman as chairman and joint managing director. After four years he gave up his executive post, but he remained chairman until his death.<br>
<br>Bellman's activities were not confined to his own society. As early as 1922 he formed the Metropolitan Building Societies Association, composed of some fifty societies, and became its first honorary secretary, then its chairman. In 1923 he was elected to the council of the central organization, the National Association of Building Societies; from 1933 to 1936 he served as its chairman, in succession to Sir Enoch Hill (1865&#150;1942). In 1934 the Building Societies Institute for training building society staff was founded, with Bellman as the first president. From 1934 until 1938 Bellman was president of the International Union of Building Societies and presided with great distinction over two conferences: at Salzburg in 1935 and at Z&uuml;rich in 1938. By this time, influence in the building society movement had become worldwide; he was especially highly regarded in the USA.<br>
<br>The years in which Bellman served as chairman of the National Association were stormy: he tried to secure the co-operation of the 374 societies for the common purpose of adopting a new code of ethics and procedure, but was frustrated by the old-established societies. In consequence, those societies assenting to the new code dissolved the National Association in 1936 and formed the new Building Societies Association. Bellman remained its chairman for another year. Some fifty societies, however, splintered off and founded their own national organization. The split was healed only in 1940 after public anxiety about alleged irregularity by a Yorkshire society in the &#145;borders' case&#146; had led to the passing of the <span class="roman">Building Societies Act</span> of 1939. This embodied in the main the code of ethics and procedure which the dissenting societies had rejected and which all societies now had to accept. The Building Societies Association then became the authoritative voice of the whole movement. Although Bellman retired from the chair in 1937 he remained on the council until 1956, when he was made a vice-president.<br>
<br>Bellman had a dignified presence and perfect articulation. He had first learned to speak in the Sunday school and the guild attached to the Wesleyan chapel in Fernhead Road, Paddington, which he claimed had been the strongest influence in his life as a boy. In 1911 Bellman married Kate, daughter of Edwin George Peacock, of Brondesbury Park. They had been at school together, but it was their common interest in the choir and the social life of the chapel which ripened their friendship. When she died in 1959 Bellman presented a window to the new Fernhead Road Chapel in her memory. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>In addition to his chapel activities, Bellman undertook a wide range of public duties, serving as chairman of Clayesmore, the boys', and Queenswood, the girls', public schools. He was chairman and treasurer of the National Children's Home, chairman of several hospitals, and a member of the Ministry of Health's Central Housing Advisory Committee and of numerous departmental committees. He was president of the Aldwych Club (1935&#150;6) and of the Advertising Association (1939); and as a member of the court of governors of the London School of Economics took a special interest in its department of business management. He was chairman of the Hampstead and Marylebone bench of magistrates and a vice-lieutenant of Middlesex. In the war of 1939&#150;45 he served as a major in 22nd Middlesex battalion Home Guard. He wrote some dozen books&#151;four of which became standard works in the building society world: <span class="italic">The Building Society Movement</span> (1927), <span class="italic">The Silent Revolution</span> (1928), <span class="italic">The Thrifty Three Millions</span> (1935), and <span class="italic">Bricks and Mortals</span> (1949). He was appointed MBE in 1920 and knighted in 1932. He was a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, an officer of the Australian order of merit, and an honorary LLD of the American University, Washington (1939).<br>
<br>Gardening was Bellman's chief relaxation; he cultivated azaleas and prize-winning roses and chrysanthemums. He died at Guy's Hospital, London, on 1 June 1963.<br>
