<span class="headword">Paveley, Sir  Walter</span>  (1319&#150;1375), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the son of Sir Walter Paveley (<i>d</i>. 1327) and Maud (1304&#150;<i>c</i>.1366), daughter and heir of Sir Stephen Burghersh (<i>d</i>. 1310). As the only son of a Kentish gentleman, Paveley could have exercised some discretion in his choice of career, but his family connections left him well placed to find long and distinguished employment in Edward III's campaigns against the French. Though the existence of at least two separate branches of the Paveley family, one based in Wiltshire and the other in Kent, has caused some confusion, it is clear that Sir Walter belonged to the latter branch. Paveley's father was of Northamptonshire stock, but his wife's inheritance left him firmly established among the Kentish gentry. The family holdings were further increased by the death of his kinsman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4007/', "Henry Burghersh")</script>, bishop of Lincoln, in 1340. Following the death of his father in January 1327, and the subsequent marriage of his mother to Sir Thomas Aledon (or Aldon), a family friend and fellow stalwart of the Burghersh circle, little is heard of Paveley until his military career began to flower in the opening exchanges of the Hundred Years' War, though he was precociously a knight by 1335.<br>
<br>Despite the problems of identification, Paveley's presence can be detected in a remarkable series of campaigns. His first recorded service was at the age of nineteen during the fitful Cambr&eacute;sis campaign of autumn 1338. He then served in Brittany with Bartholomew Burghersh in 1342&#150;3 and 1345. Froissart places him (as Guillaumes Penniel) with Sir Walter Mauny at the siege of Rennes in 1342, and in Gascony the following year. Paveley subsequently enlisted in most of the French expeditions mounted before the war was brought to a halt by the treaty of Bretigny in 1360, including the crucial Cr&eacute;cy&#150;Calais campaign of 1346&#150;7, and the Poitiers campaign of 1356.<br>
<br>Although Paveley was evidently an extremely experienced soldier, it is also clear that he owed his later prominence, at least in part, to a close friendship with the Burghersh family, above and beyond any kinship ties. Not only were most of Paveley's early campaigns conducted in the company either of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4005/', "Bartholomew Burghersh, Lord Burghersh")</script>, or of the latter's son, also <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4006/', "Bartholomew Burghersh")</script>, but Paveley also enjoyed sufficient esteem with his baronial cousins to be involved in their personal affairs. For example, in June 1354 Paveley obtained letters of protection to travel to the Holy Land with the younger Bartholomew, who in May 1365, now Lord Burghersh, nominated Paveley as one of his attorneys as he prepared for a trip to Flanders; more significantly, in 1369 Paveley was named as one of Burghersh's executors and was left a gilt cup, a suit of armour, and some Kentish estates in the latter's will.<br>
<br>In itself useful, this connection may also have brought Paveley to the attention of Edward, the Black Prince&#151;it can hardly be coincidental that both Bartholomew Burghersh junior and Walter Paveley appear frequently in the prince's household records, the former as an official and confidant, and the latter as a &#145;bachelor&#146; with an annuity of 40 marks. It is difficult to pinpoint Paveley's initial contact with Prince Edward, but he was certainly held in high regard by the time of the battle of Cr&eacute;cy, where he acted as one of the prince's advisers, for which he was later rewarded with generous new year's gifts while on campaign in Normandy. Paveley's inclusion in the late 1340s among the original knights of the Garter confirms his membership of the close-knit body of aristocratic soldiers who provided the backbone of Edward III's armies [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92770', "Founding knights of the Order of the Garter")</script>].<br>
<br>Paveley died on 28 June 1375, and was buried in the church of the Blackfriars, London. With his wife (perhaps Joan St Philibert), to whom he was certainly married by 1354, he had two sons: Sir Edward, who died on 7 December 1375, and Sir Walter, who was killed in the naval expedition of 1379. Neither left any children, and their estates descended to the Aledon family. Paveley's arms, azure a cross flory or, appear in the thirteenth stall on the prince's side at Windsor.<br>
