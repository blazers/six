<span class="headword">Beeston,  Alfred Felix Landon</span>  (1911&#150;1995), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was born at 12 Glebe Road, Barnes, south London, on 23 February 1911, the second child and only son of Herbert Arthur Beeston (1872&#150;1941), an engineer and draughtsman, and Edith Mary Landon (1873&#150;1965). In his undergraduate days he came to be called Freddie, a name by which he was universally known to friends, colleagues, and students for the rest of his life, though he was called Rogo by his close family.<br>
<br>At fourteen Beeston was elected a king's scholar at Westminster School. From at least the age of ten he had had &#145;a passionate interest in foreign languages&#146;  (Beeston, &#145;The Making of an Orientalist&#146;, 4) and he spent much of his spare time exploring them. While he &#145;avidly scanned any language manuals I could lay my hands on, from ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs to Spanish and Welsh, etc.&#151;the more exotic the better&#146;  (ibid.), his principal &#145;interest was in theoretical linguistics, in the structure of a language and its strategies for expressing ideas&#146;  (ibid.). He had &#145;always had an inclination for specializing in something unusual and exotic&#146;  (Beeston, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, xv) and toyed with the idea of studying Sanskrit or Chinese, but was unable to find suitable books. However, when he picked up an Arabic grammar in a second-hand bookshop he began to teach himself as much Arabic as he could, helped by an Arabic dictionary and a copy of the <span class="roman">Koran</span> which he had asked for as school prizes. Thus it was almost by chance that he concentrated his considerable energies on Arabic, though in later life he also acquired a knowledge of Chinese and a sophisticated understanding of its structures with which he sometimes startled Sinologists.<br>
<br>In 1929 Beeston won a scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, where he read classics for honour moderations and then Arabic and Persian for the final honours school under the Laudian professor, D. S. Margoliouth. To his delight he discovered that Margoliouth had placed on the Arabic syllabus an optional paper on South Arabian epigraphy. Beeston was the first student to take this and, after he had graduated with a first in 1933, he decided to make Sabaean inscriptions the subject of his DPhil thesis.<br>
<br>In 1935, while he was still working on his DPhil, Beeston was appointed a senior assistant in the department of oriental books of the Bodleian Library, where he remained for twenty years (not counting five and a half years of war service from 1940 to 1946). There he threw himself into several cataloguing and catalogue revision projects, the most important of which resulted in his completion in 1954 of the <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Persian, Turkish, Hindustani, and Pushtu manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, part III: additional Persian manuscripts</span>. During this period he also produced a number of articles on the Bodleian's oriental holdings (Arabic, Persian, Chinese), and a booklet on Mughal miniatures, as well as numerous papers on South Arabian epigraphy. However, he regarded his principal service to the library to have been &#145;the acquisition of several particularly fine manuscripts at pretty reasonable prices&#146;  (Beeston, &#145;The Making of an Orientalist&#146;, 5). After he left the library he continued to make generous donations from his own resources to enable the Bodleian to acquire important oriental manuscripts.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Beeston served in Palestine as lieutenant, and then captain, in the intelligence corps. There he improved his spoken Arabic, though he later recalled that, when caught off guard, he was still capable of answering the shouts of boys in the street with literary expressions which elicited gales of laughter. On his return to the Bodleian in 1946 he was promoted to the post of keeper of the oriental department and sub-librarian. He remained there until 1955, when Sir Hamilton Gibb, who had succeeded Margoliouth as Laudian professor of Arabic, resigned to take up a post at Harvard. Sir Godfrey Driver immediately &#145;instructed&#146; Beeston &#145;in the most positive terms&#146; to apply for the chair  (Beeston, &#145;The Making of an Orientalist&#146;, 5). At this point Beeston had reached the summit of his career in the Bodleian and had completed all but one of the major projects on which he had embarked. Thus a change of direction offered exciting, if slightly alarming, prospects. The chair carried with it a professorial fellowship at St John's College. There he quickly found himself entirely at home.<br>
<br>Beeston brought to the chair a profound knowledge and understanding of all periods of the Arabic language and the literature expressed in it. In 1955, when he was appointed, the Arabic syllabus did not go beyond <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1400 and one of his major achievements was to rewrite it so that students were required to read works from all periods, from the pre-Islamic poetry to twentieth-century plays and novels&#151;and this at a time when the English literature syllabus at Oxford stopped at 1900.<br>
<br>Beeston had an intense love of his subject and his enthusiasm inspired generations of students. He was a modest, courteous, and patient teacher with a deep interest in awakening in others an understanding and appreciation of the Arabic language and its literature. Unlike most Oxford professors of his day he undertook a great deal of undergraduate teaching, in lectures, classes, and tutorials, and both during his tenure and after his retirement he was in great demand as an examiner of doctoral theses. His lecturing style was ponderous, full of long pauses, and punctuated by appalling fits of coughing (he was a very heavy smoker), but the content and his enthusiasm held his audience fascinated. Many of the books he wrote were intended for students, though they had a far wider readership; they included <span class="italic">Written Arabic</span> (1968), <span class="italic">Arabic Historical Phraseology</span> (1969), <span class="italic">Samples of Arabic Prose in its Historical Development</span> (1977), <span class="italic">Baidot&#257;w&#299;'s Commentary on S&#363;rah 12 of the Qur&#146;&#257;n</span> (1963), and <span class="italic">The Epistle on Singing-Girls of J&#257;hiz</span> (1980). He was interested in languages not simply as abstract systems but in how they could be used to express complex thoughts. This came out in his numerous articles on points of grammar, in his classes on the translation of poetry and difficult passages in al-Tanukhi and Ibn Khaldun's <span class="italic">Muqaddimah</span>, and above all in his book <span class="italic">The Arabic Language Today</span> (1970).<br>
<br>Beeston was, without doubt, one of the foremost Arabists of the twentieth century, but by the time he retired in 1978 he was also the doyen of experts in Ancient South Arabian. He produced two grammars of Sabaic (1962 and 1984), led the project which produced the <span class="italic">Sabaic Dictionary</span> (1982), and wrote innumerable articles and contributions to books on every aspect of life in pre-Islamic Arabia. Here again his passion for teaching was engaged, and he was the driving force in the multi-author Arabic <span class="italic">Chrestomathy of Ancient Yemeni Inscriptions</span> (1985), designed to introduce Arab students to the subject. Between his retirement in 1978 and his death in 1995 he produced an astonishing number of books and articles on the Arabic language, Arabic literature, and pre-Islamic Arabia which have made major contributions to all three fields.<br>
<br>Beeston could be a devastating reviewer, but he was never vicious or personal in his criticism. He simply and calmly pointed out faults when necessary and gave praise where it was due. He believed that &#145;error must be corrected&#146;  (personal knowledge) and was himself happy to be corrected by others. His interest was in the progress of knowledge and there was no shred of personal vanity in him. He received two Festschriften. One, <span class="italic">Sayhadica: recherches sur les inscriptions de l'Arabie pr&eacute;islamique</span> (1987), is devoted to pre-Islamic Arabia and the other, <span class="italic">Arabicus Felix: luminosus Britannicus</span>, which was presented on his eightieth birthday in 1991, mainly contains works on Arabic language and literature.<br>
<br>Until 1963 Beeston's appearance was relatively conventional, largely out of respect for the views of the president of St John's College, Austin Lane Poole. However, after the latter's death, Beeston developed the flowing locks and informal garb which made him instantly recognizable in Oxford and elsewhere. He loved good food and drink and good company. His appearance and somewhat &#145;monumental&#146; manner were reminiscent of Dr Johnson and could be a little daunting on first meeting. However, his modesty, humour, and total lack of pretension quickly put people at their ease. He was as comfortable playing darts with the college servants in the pub as he was dining at high table, and frequently did both in the same evening. Indeed there were many in Oxford who knew him simply as &#145;Freddie&#146; and had no idea that he was a professor.<br>
<br>He was a very popular participant in conferences and was a co-founder and one of the most faithful members of the annual international Seminar for Arabian Studies. He served on the councils of many learned societies and was elected fellow of the British Academy in 1965. Throughout his life he was a devout Anglo-Catholic and regularly attended mass at the church of St Mary Magdalen in Oxford.<br>
<br>On his retirement Beeston bought a small house in Iffley, but still spent much of his day in college since St John's had made him an emeritus fellow. He never married and though he was a much-loved uncle, great-uncle, and godfather the college was in many ways his home and close family. In 1993 he developed cancer and moved back into college to be closer to the hospitals for treatment. His death, when it came, was swift and merciful. He collapsed and died on 29 September 1995 at the gates of St John's College.<br>
