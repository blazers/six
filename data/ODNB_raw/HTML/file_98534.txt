<span class="headword">Denton, Sir  Eric James</span>  (1923&#150;2007), <span class="occ">marine biologist and physiologist</span>, was born on 30 September 1923 at 53 Denby Street, Bentley, Yorkshire, the only child of George Denton, a fitter at a colliery, later a grocer, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ogden, who ran a dress shop. He won a scholarship to Doncaster grammar school and a state scholarship to St John's College, Cambridge, where he read physics for two years before joining the Telecommunications Research Establishment at Malvern in 1942. There he worked on radar technology and met Nancy Emily Wright, whom he married at Christ Church, Doncaster, on 19 December 1946. She was the daughter of Charles Henry Wright of Doncaster. They had a daughter, Susan Mary (<i>b</i>. 1948), and two sons, Andrew (<i>b</i>. 1950) and Christopher (<i>b</i>. 1954).<br>
<br>In the same year as his marriage Denton joined the biophysics group of the Nobel laureate A. V. Hill at University College, London. During this period he graduated BSc in physiology with first-class honours. Denton often remarked that this was the most important period in his career, as it allowed him to begin to apply physical principles to physiology&#151;an approach that underpinned much of his subsequent career. In 1948 he gained a full lectureship at the University of Aberdeen, focusing his research on the physiology of vision. He spent eight years in teaching and research in Aberdeen before moving in 1956 to the Plymouth laboratory of the Marine Biological Association (MBA) as a physiologist. He became concurrently a Royal Society research professor at the University of Bristol in 1964.<br>
<br>The MBA provided the perfect environment for Denton's research endeavours, being one of the foremost physiological and marine biological laboratories and attracting world-class scientists, including the Nobel prize-winning squid physiologists Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley, along with many others. Denton's research interests began to broaden further at Plymouth. His research on vision extended from the study of the visual pigments of vertebrates to obtaining a deeper understanding of the structure of the eyes, luminescent organs, and external reflective surfaces of fish. He greatly improved the understanding of camouflage in fish and how they use reflective scales that, in the light environment under the sea, enable them to render themselves largely invisible to predators. His research was punctuated with groundbreaking discoveries, such as the finding that a species of deep sea dragonfish could use a &#145;searchlight&#146; to illuminate its prey. He went on to make major discoveries relating to buoyancy in fish and cephalopods. In his later researches he developed a fruitful collaboration with Sir John Gray (former secretary of the Medical Research Council) through which they applied a combination of physiological and theoretical approaches to deepen the understanding of how fish perceive sound, movement, and distance, and in particular how their anatomy allows particularly efficient coupling between the swim bladder and the ear. Denton's skills in the laboratory were matched by his enthusiasm for working at sea on research vessels like <span class="italic">Sarsia</span> and <span class="italic">Discovery</span>, which helped him to place his biophysical work into a broad biological and ecological context. It was his view that all scientific staff at the MBA should have experience of working at sea.<br>
<br>Denton was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and made ScD of Cambridge, both in 1964. He served as a council member and vice-president of the Royal Society, sat on many committees, and was a member of the royal commission on environmental pollution (1973&#150;6). He was appointed CBE in 1974. Also in 1974 he became director of the MBA, taking on a substantial administrative load. He continued to develop the reputation of the MBA as a premier marine biological research laboratory, in particular making its facilities open to its many visitors, whom he regarded as being as important as the resident staff. His directorial style allowed scientists and visitors the freedom to explore the most interesting and exciting problems of the time and he engaged fully and enthusiastically with all researchers in Plymouth. He continued to carry out his own experiments, dividing his time between the laboratory and the director's office. Those who worked with him were struck by his desire for rigorous analysis and scientific discussion, driven by his natural curiosity. Coffee breaks would invariably turn into discussion sessions and he would simply, and often unexpectedly, drop into a laboratory or office to find out what was going on&#151;and what had been discovered recently&#151;from whoever was there. He was an extremely sociable individual and he and Nancy received many guests at their family home in St Germans, Cornwall.<br>
<br>Denton received a number of the highest academic accolades, the most notable of which were (both in 1987, the year of his retirement) the Zoological Society's Frink medal and the Royal Society's royal medal. He was also knighted in 1987 for services to marine biology. He was awarded the Japan international prize for biology in 1989. He carried on with his research as an honorary fellow of the MBA after his retirement for a number of years. The progression of Parkinson's disease made it increasingly difficult for him to continue and eventually to communicate. True to his character, however, he developed a keen scientific interest in the condition and invented numerous devices to allay the symptoms based on his increasing understanding of its neurological basis. His family cared for him in his final years and he died on 2 January 2007 at Poldhu Nursing Home, Poldhu Cove, near Helston, Cornwall. He was cremated at Bodmin crematorium in January 2007, and was survived by his wife, Nancy, and their three children.<br>
