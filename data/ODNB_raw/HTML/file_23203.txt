<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ray <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Wray]</span>,  John</span>  (1627&#150;1705), <span class="occ">naturalist and theologian</span>, was born at Black Notley, near Braintree, Essex, on 29 November 1627, the third child of Roger Wray (<i>bap</i>. 1594, <i>d</i>. 1655), a blacksmith, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1600&#150;1679), who was noted for her piety and her knowledge of medicinal herbs. Until 1670 he spelled his surname with an initial W, which he dropped in order to facilitate the Latinizing of his name.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearswritingsandtravels"></a>Early years, writings, and travels</h2>Wray was sent to the grammar school at Braintree, and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, on 12 May 1644. On 28 June he moved to St Catharine's College, where he became the pupil of Daniel Duckfield. Following the death of his tutor and the expulsion of the master, Ralph Brownrig, Wray transferred to Trinity, where he became a sizar on 21 November 1646 under the tuition of James Duport. Wray took his BA degree in 1647/8, and on 8 September 1649 was elected to a minor fellowship. He held a succession of college positions thereafter, being elected Greek lecturer in 1651 (the year in which he graduated MA) and 1656, mathematical lecturer in 1653, humanities lecturer in 1655, praelector in 1657, junior dean in 1658, and college steward in 1659 and 1660. With Duport, Wray had honed his skill in Latin and Greek, and perhaps also Hebrew. He composed several Latin poems, including contributions to collections published in honour of Cromwell (1654) and Charles II (1660). In addition to college lectures and exercises, he also preached at Trinity and in Great St Mary's, including, in 1659, the funeral sermons of John Arrowsmith, master of Trinity, and John Nidd, a senior fellow. With Nidd and others Wray began to develop interests in natural philosophy during the 1650s, in particular through the study of embryology and chemistry. At this time Wray took pupils of his own, among them Philip Skippon and Timothy Burrell. He also came into contact with two fellow-commoners with similar interests, Francis Willughby, another pupil of Duport, and Peter Courthope.<br>
<br>Between 1650 and 1658 Trinity suspended the normal requirement that its fellows should take orders, but by January 1659 Wray was actively considering his position. He was offered the living of Cheadle in 1659, and in 1661 that of Kirkby Lonsdale. He complained to Courthope on 26 September 1660 that &#145;they have brought all things heer as they were [in] 1641&#146;, and asserted that &#145;I am long since come to two resolutions, 1. No promise of conformity 2. No orders rebus sic stantibus [as things stand]&#146;  (Ray to Courthope, 26 Sept 1660, E. Sussex RO, MS Danny 346). Yet the determination of his college to keep him persuaded Wray, and he was ordained by Robert Sanderson, bishop of Lincoln, in his chapel at the Barbican on 23 December 1660. Wray's personal piety was never in question, indeed it contributed to the sense of the duties of a priest which informed his later writings in natural theology, and which, at this time, led him to consider taking up a country living. However, several of his friends leaned towards nonconformity, and Wray himself had hopes for a more comprehensive settlement of the church than that achieved after the Restoration. Moreover, he was &#145;so nicely scrupulous about oaths&#146;  (Dale, Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. Essex 21, fol. 379<i>r</i>), that he felt unable to accept the terms of the abjuration of the solemn league and covenant required by the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>. On 24 August 1662 he thus forfeited his fellowship at Trinity, although he remained a loyal member of the Church of England. Wray cast himself &#145;upon Providence &amp; good friends&#146;, resolving that &#145;Liberty is a sweet thing&#146;  (Ray to Courthope, 13 Aug 1662, E. Sussex RO, MS Danny 358). The prospect of support from Courthope, Willughby, or Skippon may have been one reason for Wray's decisions. The main explanation was, however, his determination to travel in pursuit of natural philosophical observations, in particular botanical specimens.<br>
<br>Wray had kept a small garden at Trinity in which he planted specimens that he had collected or which his friends had sent to him, and where he was able to investigate the differences between specific varieties of plants and trees. His activity as a cultivator reflected his broader interest in the recording and collection of plant types and specimens, which had been stimulated by rides and walks taken in his youth. He had already acquired considerable familiarity with the existing English botanical literature and its limitations, and was struck by the absence of anyone who was proficient in the subject at the university. He thus decided in the early 1650s to embark on a catalogue of all the plants that he had found during his long walks in the countryside around Cambridge. He received encouragement from Nidd, Willughby, and Courthope, as well as assistance from John Worthington, master of Jesus College, who procured a manuscript of Joachim Jungius's as yet unpublished &#145;Isagoge phytoscopica&#146; for him from Samuel Hartlib. His <span class="italic">Catalogus plantarum circa Cantabrigiam nascentium</span> (1660) described 558 species of native plant which he had recognized, as well as the crops growing in Cambridgeshire. An appendix was published in 1663. The catalogue was arranged alphabetically, with the titles used by Gerard, Parkinson, and Jean and Gaspard Bauhin also included. The circumstances and uses of the plants were described and the English names of their locations given. Wray added natural philosophical observations, for example concerning the behaviour of caterpillars, at appropriate points, and an index allowed the English reader to identify plants by their common names. The <span class="italic">Catalogus</span> demonstrated the meticulous nature of his approach to botany. It identified several new plants but reconciled many descriptions to avoid the unnecessary multiplication of species. Compared with his descriptions of flowering plants, however, those of trees, shrubs, and grasses were less satisfactory. Moreover, the catalogue contained only a very brief outline of the structure and classification of plants, which drew heavily on the work of Jean Bauhin, although its preface expressed the hope that similar studies might be undertaken in other localities, allowing the eventual composition of a complete &#145;Phytologia Britannica&#146;.<br>
<br>On 9 August 1658 Wray had embarked on his first botanizing itinerary outside Cambridgeshire, riding to Northampton and then on to Warwick before journeying through the Peaks and into north Wales, returning to Cambridge on 18 September via Shrewsbury, Worcester, and Gloucester. On this tour he had collected botanical, natural philosophical, and topographical observations. By February 1660 his plans to undertake a new catalogue of all English plants led him to write to friends across the country asking for their assistance and to contemplate further itineraries of his own. That year he and Willughby embarked on a northern tour, probably taking in parts of Yorkshire, Cumberland, Westmorland, and the Isle of Man. In July the following year Wray set out on a further journey, this time in the company of Skippon. Much of this trip was devoted to visiting places of antiquarian interest in Lincolnshire, the north-east, and Yorkshire, but he also made observations of plants and sea creatures. On 16 August he entered Scotland, travelling on to Edinburgh and Glasgow, before returning via Carlisle. In spring 1662 he spent some time in Sussex as Courthope's guest, returning via London where he inspected Robert Morison's work in St James's Park. In the months immediately preceding the end of his fellowship, Wray undertook his most ambitious itinerary yet, this time in the company of both Willughby and Skippon.<h2>
<a name="TravelsandcollaborationwithFrancisWillughby"></a>Travels and collaboration with Francis Willughby</h2>Setting out from Middleton Hall in Tamworth, the seat of the Willughbys, the three men travelled through the midlands into north Wales and continued on to Anglesey, and thence to Snowdonia, before turning south along the Welsh coast. On the way they described antiquities, local customs and legends, recorded plants, and observed fishes and birds, notably the puffins of Prestholm. Once they returned to England, Willughby split from the party, but Wray and Skippon went on together as far as Land's End before returning to London by way of Stonehenge. After a brief stay in Essex, Wray returned to Cambridge at the end of August to settle his affairs. Thereafter he stayed with friends, from October serving as a tutor in the household of Thomas Bacon at Friston Hall, near Saxmundham in Suffolk.<br>
<br>On 18 April 1663 Wray, Willughby, Skippon, and Nathaniel Bacon sailed from Dover for the continent. At Willughby's instigation they had planned a tour which would allow Wray to collect and catalogue plants that were not native to England and Willughby to observe birds, beasts, fishes, and insects. From Calais they travelled into Flanders and the Netherlands, then up the Rhine, and across southern Germany to Munich and Vienna, before heading by coach for Venice. After spending the winter in Padua, where Wray attended the anatomy lectures of Pietro Marchetti, they toured northern Italy. Travelling by Milan and Turin, they took a boat from Genoa along the coast to Lucca, Pisa, Leghorn, and, finally, Naples. There Wray and Skippon parted from Bacon and Willughby (who later travelled to Spain on his own) and went on together to Sicily and Malta, later returning by sea to Leghorn and thence to Florence. On 1 September 1664 they set out for Rome, where, in December, Wray made observations of the comet (published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, 1707). With Skippon he left Rome on 24 January 1665, returned to Venice, and then entered Switzerland via the lower Engadine. They eventually reached Geneva on 20 April and spent the summer there, botanizing in the mountains nearby. In late July they entered France, travelling to Montpellier where they remained for some time, and in the autumn and winter exploring southern France. On 1 February 1666 all English visitors were ordered to leave France within three months. Wray and Skippon headed north to Lyons and then stayed for a while in Paris where they met a number of prominent botanists. Wray embarked for England from Calais on 1 April 1666.<br>
<br>After his return Wray spent his time either in Essex or with his friends in Sussex, and also visited Cambridge. He conducted a programme of reading in natural philosophy, passing most of the winter with Willughby at Middleton before travelling with him to the west of England in summer 1667. On 7 November Wray was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, having been proposed by John Wilkins. Later that month Wray went to stay with Burrell in Sussex; he remained there until the spring, when he set out to travel between the homes of various friends and in the process traversed north Yorkshire and Westmorland, where he located several new species of plants. He wintered again at Middleton, conducting experiments of the rise of sap in trees and making observations of snails and of spiders' threads. In April 1669 Wray and Willughby visited Wilkins near Chester, and the former dissected a porpoise which had been caught by some fishermen. These activities were later written up and communicated to the Royal Society and accounts of them were published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. Until Willughby's premature death on 3 July 1672 Ray (as he now called himself) and his friend worked together for much of the time at Middleton on their respective projects in natural history. In July 1671, however, Ray was absent for a time on a further simpling tour with Thomas Willisel in the north of England.<br>
<br>Ray's travels had established the basis for his collaboration with Willughby, the fruits of which occupied him for much of the rest of his life. They provided information on birds, fishes, and insects, initially intended for use by Willughby, but later written up by Ray. They also generated evidence about antiquities, customs, and language, which Ray shared with Willughby and deployed himself in the <span class="italic">Collection of English Proverbs</span> (1670; rev. 1678) and the <span class="italic">Collection of English Words</span> (1674; rev. 1691). The <span class="italic">Observations Topographical, Moral, and Physiological</span> (1673) which Ray published of his and Willughby's continental journeys contained extensive discussions of these topics, as well as interventions in contemporary natural philosophical debates, such as that about fossil shells generated by Steno's <span class="italic">Prodromus</span> (1669). Furthermore, Ray's journeys had allowed him to expand his knowledge of plants, and build up a formidable collection of specimens.<h2>
<a name="Laterwritingsonplants"></a>Later writings on plants</h2>In 1666 Wilkins sought the collaboration of Ray and Willughby in drawing up the tables of plants and animals to be published in the <span class="italic">Essay towards a Real Character</span> (1668). This work, which took Ray a mere three weeks and which was harshly criticized by Morison, improved on the classifications given in Christopher Merret's <span class="italic">Pinax</span> but was limited by the need to conform to the existing schemes laid down by Wilkins. For a time Ray was occupied with an abortive Latin translation of the <span class="italic">Essay</span> but by 1670 he was ready to publish his <span class="italic">Catalogus plantarum Angliae</span>, which he dedicated to Willughby. A second edition was published in 1677, and an appendix of newly observed plants by &#145;John Ray and his friends&#146;, <span class="italic">Fasciculus stirpium Britannicarum</span> (1688), printed when Ray was unable to persuade the booksellers who held the copyright to issue a third edition. Ray's work was notable not only for its thoroughness but also for the extensive medical and pharmacological notes which accompanied the descriptions of plants. The preface to the volume made clear Ray's conviction that the divine creation of plants implied a purpose to their existence, which might be discovered by putting them to use. Ray's work on classification and on the nature of plant species was continued in the &#145;Catalogue of plants not native of England&#146; which he appended to the <span class="italic">Observations</span> and articulated more fully in the <span class="italic">Methodus plantarum nova</span> (1682).<br>
<br>This work rejected classifications based on localities or properties in favour of ones based on the structure of plants, drawing on Ray's own studies of seeds and the specific differences of plants (sent to the Royal Society on 30 November 1674) and on the discoveries of Marcello Malpighi. It also developed the views of a paper on the number of plants which Ray had composed for communication to the Royal Society, probably in 1674, but which was never sent. This made clear Ray's belief in the importance of essential, rather than accidental, characteristics in identifying a species, and his conviction that all local species were likely to be preserved by providence somewhere in the world. Ray anticipated Malpighi in making a distinction between monocotyledons and dicotyledons, and he later developed his observations of the invariability of the seed vessels of plants into the basis for his system of classification. In this he followed both Morison and Andrea Cesalpino, although he also asserted the importance of the form of the petals and calyx, and the arrangement of the plant's leaves, and was indebted to Jungius for his treatment of flowers. Ray's attempts at classification were, however, marred by his retention of a primary division of plants into herbs, shrubs, and trees, despite an awareness of the difficulties associated with it. His treatment of shrubs and trees remained less satisfactory than that of herbs. Even there, Ray's ignorance of marine and exotic plants led him into frequent errors.<br>
<br>The culmination of Ray's career as a botanist came with the publication of his <span class="italic">Historia plantarum</span>, whose two folio volumes appeared in 1686 and 1688, with a further supplementary volume eventually being published, after abortive attempts to raise subscriptions, in 1704. The first two volumes described approximately 6100 species of plant, many of which Ray had seen or had had described for him by his botanical correspondents, who now included Samuel Dale, Tancred Robinson, and Hans Sloane; the third volume was more of a compilation, detailing a further 10,000 species, largely on the evidence of printed sources. Despite the excellence of his contacts, Ray's work was hampered by increasing old age and infirmity, which in particular prevented him from visiting the gardens being cultivated at Oxford and Chelsea which might have allowed him to observe many exotic plants at first hand. Despite its ambitions to completeness Ray's herbal lacked illustrations, in part due to scruples about the potential inaccuracy of woodcuts, but mainly because of anxieties about their cost.<br>
<br>In 1690 Ray published <span class="italic">Synopsis methodica stirpium Britannicarum</span>, of which a second edition appeared in 1696, and a third, expanded by Johann Jakob Dillenius, in 1724. This work followed the classificatory system of Ray's <span class="italic">Methodus</span>. With Sloane's encouragement Ray produced an edition of Leonhart Rauwolf's travels (1693); he drew up all but one of the English county lists of plants for Edmund Gibson's edition of Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span> (1695); and, with the support of the Royal Society, he issued a further catalogue of European plants (<span class="italic">Stirpium Europaearum extra Britannias nascentium sylloge</span>) in 1694. This included a defence of his own method of classification against that of Rivinus (A. Q. Bachmann), which was based on differences in the shape of the flower. An exchange of letters with Rivinus appeared in the second edition of the <span class="italic">Synopsis</span>, where Ray referred to the writings of Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, also criticized in his <span class="italic">Dissertatio brevis</span> (1696). Ray took the work of both Rivinus and Tournefort into account in the composition of <span class="italic">Methodus plantarum emendata</span> (1703), which revised his classifications and introduced divisions between flowering and non-flowering plants.<h2>
<a name="MarriageandworkonWillughbysintellectuallegacy"></a>Marriage and work on Willughby's intellectual legacy</h2>Willughby's death in 1672 deprived Ray of both a collaborator and a patron but provided him with an annuity of &pound;60, and hence a measure of financial independence. Ray also acquired fresh obligations as an executor of Willughby's will, charged with the care of his two young sons and the publication of his incomplete works in natural history. For three and a half years Ray lived at Middleton, and helped to educate the children. With this end in mind he published <span class="italic">Dictionariolum trilingue</span> (1675), later reissued as <span class="italic">Nomenclator classicus</span>, which went through four editions by the time of his death. More demanding work was required to turn Willughby's observations, notes, and descriptions into coherent treatises. Initially Ray embarked on revising Willughby's <span class="italic">Ornithology</span>, writing up its author's notes into proper descriptions, collating authorities, and imposing a method of classification which might make sense of the whole. Ray's descriptions gave detailed accounts of plumage, and his classification drew on the divisions according to habit in the tables which Willughby had provided for Wilkins, developing them by concentrating on structural and anatomical differences, for example in beaks or claws, which could be observed between species. In all Ray and Willughby described more than 230 species which they had themselves observed. The work was published in Latin in 1676, with illustrations paid for by Willughby's widow, Emma. These were largely re-engraved from other books and Ray found many of them unsatisfactory; nevertheless he reissued the <span class="italic">Ornithology</span> in English in 1678, with additional descriptions of seabirds and discussions of falconry and fowling.<br>
<br>On 5 June 1673 Ray married Margaret Oakeley (<i>c</i>.1653&#150;<i>c</i>.1727), daughter of John Oakeley of Launton, near Bicester in Oxfordshire, and a member of the household at Middleton. The couple left Middleton during the winter of 1675&#150;6, moving initially to Coleshill, and then settling at Sutton Coldfield in April 1676. By this time Willughby's mother had died and his widow had married Sir Josiah Child, bt, in the process quitting Middleton with her children, who were finally removed from Ray's charge by order of the lord chancellor in 1677. Ray's relations with Emma Child worsened over the next few years, in which she declined to assist with the costs of Ray's edition of her late husband's work on fishes and quarrelled over the administration of the trust resulting from his will. Ray refused to act as a cipher to enable her to manage the trust &#145;more securely &amp; unaccountably then if you had been appointed Sole Executrix&#146;  (Ray to Lady Child, 6 Sept 1680, Nottingham University, MS Mi E4/32). Unable any longer to fulfil his duties to Willughby's children, and deprived of the library at Middleton, Ray initially considered going abroad as a tutor, but instead moved back to Essex where he lodged at first in Faulkbourne Hall, near Witham, as a guest of Edward Bullock. In autumn 1677 he turned down the offer of the secretaryship of the Royal Society, in a letter to John Aubrey the following March giving as his reasons &#145;the consciousness of my inability to manage it, but chiefly its inconsistency w[i]th my profession&#146;  (<span class="italic">Further Correspondence</span>, 159). The death of his mother on 15 March 1679 allowed Ray and his wife to move back to Black Notley, and to settle in the family house at Dewlands, where they lived for the rest of their lives. They had four daughters, Margaret and Mary (<i>b</i>. 1684), Catharine (<i>b</i>. 1687), and Jane (<i>b</i>. 1689), all of whom later assisted their father in the collection of insects during the 1690s. Ray felt Mary's death from jaundice in January 1698 as &#145;a sore blow&#146;, writing to Edward Lhwyd on 12 March 1697 that she &#145;was very ingenious, &amp; helpfull to me, &amp; upon that account the more dear too&#146;  (ibid., 268).<br>
<br>During the later 1670s and the early 1680s Ray was extensively engaged in the revision of Willughby's notes for a natural history of fishes. He began in earnest in December 1674, starting to gather further information from books, notably the works of Gesner and Rondelet, and from his friends. The resulting <span class="italic">Historia piscium</span> (1686), which was largely Ray's own work, was finished some time before 1685, when Tancred Robinson brought it to the attention of the Royal Society. At the urging of Robert Plot, the society decided to commission new, engraved plates for the work, to be paid for by subscription, and to pay the costs of having it printed by the Oxford University Press. Samuel Pepys, the society's president, subscribed &pound;50, which financed seventy-nine of the 187 plates. The expense so strained the resources of the society that it was forced for some time to pay its officers in multiple copies of the work. Even so enough of the 500 copies of the first edition remained unsold for it to be reissued only as late as 1743. The book was perhaps more of a success intellectually than financially. Ray was respectful towards Aristotle's classification of fishes, making further distinctions himself principally on the basis of fin structure, but again eschewing the unnecessary multiplication of species. He rejected the view common among his contemporaries that molluscs and other invertebrates should be classified as fish, but nevertheless continued to number cetaceans in that category.<br>
<br>On 18 April 1684 Robinson had prompted Ray to embark on &#145;a general history of nature&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 141), and during the early 1690s Ray worked on synopses of his treatments of quadrupeds and snakes (published in 1693) and of birds and fishes (largely completed by 1694, but not published until 1713). The first of these drew extensively on Willughby's work, his own observations, and the work of contemporary anatomists, notably in Paris. It rejected elements of Aristotle's system of classification and attacked the Cartesian theory of the beast machine. Ray agreed with the work of Francesco Redi in rejecting spontaneous generation. Inclining towards an ovist position, he was sceptical about some of the conclusions of the microscopist Antoni van Leeuwenhoek concerning spermatozoa, and also articulated his acceptance of the role of a plastic spirit in forming animals according to the divine plan. In this he followed the teachings of Ralph Cudworth and others of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94274', "Cambridge Platonists")</script>.<br>
<br>The last years of Ray's life were devoted to preparing a <span class="italic">Methodus</span> (1705) and <span class="italic">Historia</span> (left unfinished at his death, but published in 1710) of insects. Ray's work, which again drew on his collaboration with Willughby for its inspiration, was notable for its close observation of the various stages of an insect's life, and for its identification of many British species of butterflies. The activity of insects was prominent in Ray's consciousness for a different reason for most of the last eighteen years of his life. Ray suffered from chronic ill health during this period, in particular from incurable ulcers on his legs which, he reported in a letter to Sloane, he took &#145;to proceed from invisible insects&#146; and from tumours &#145;which may be the nests of these insects (like ant-hills), they seeming to be gregarious&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 343). Whatever the cause of his infirmity, Ray was lame and in great discomfort much of the time. He died at Dewlands on 17 January 1705.<h2>
<a name="Naturaltheologyandreputation"></a>Natural theology and reputation</h2>During much of the 1690s Ray was engaged in correspondence with Edward Lhwyd and others about the nature of fossils. In general he was inclined to accept that they were the remains of once-living creatures, and he also suggested that their current distribution might owe something to observable changes in the nature of the surface of the earth. He qualified these opinions, however, by stressing that the fossils which had so far been discovered were not unlike known plants and animals, and that their burial might owe something to the action of the biblical flood, as well as to natural effects. He argued that those remains which seemed to be unfamiliar might represent species of which the surviving representatives had not yet been discovered. Although fossils were mentioned in the preface to his <span class="italic">Synopsis</span> (1690), his fullest treatment of them was in <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Discourses Concerning the Dissolution and Changes of the World</span> (1692). This was reworked and expanded as <span class="italic">Three Physico-Theological Discourses</span> (1693). Ray completed further revisions early in 1704, but the publication of a third edition was delayed until 1713 by the death of his bookseller, Samuel Smith. The work was also translated into Dutch (1694, 1783) and German (1698, 1732). In it Ray revisited lectures which he had delivered at Great St Mary's some thirty years earlier on the text of <span class="roman">2 Peter</span> 3: 11. The publications of Thomas Burnet had rendered their subjects current, and Ray used them to provide a framework for his own discussion of creation, the deluge, and the future dissolution of the world.<br>
<br>In 1691 Ray had published another work which drew on the preaching of his Cambridge years, <span class="italic">The Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of the Creation</span>. Three further editions appeared in his lifetime, and many more thereafter, and the book was also translated into French (1714) and German (1717). Basing himself on sermons he had delivered in the chapel of Trinity College, Ray produced a coherent natural theology in which the evidence of the heavens, geology, botany, zoology, and human anatomy suggested the providential action of a benevolent deity who was responsible for the creation of all things. He was critical of those ancient and modern authors, including Aristotle and Descartes, whose work appeared to give succour to atheists or deists.<br>
<br>Both <span class="italic">The Wisdom of God</span> and the <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Discourses</span> testified to Ray's skill in constructing an account of nature which remained compatible with orthodox interpretations of scripture. Although they were the most complete statements of his natural theology, Ray had referred to the theological benefits of contemplating the glories of creation many years before, for example in the preface to Willughby's <span class="italic">Ornithology</span>. Similar sentiments are also expressed in the preface to his own <span class="italic">Synopsis</span>, which also made clear his sense of relief following the revolution of 1688. As a result of the changed political and religious circumstances of the 1690s, exemplified by Archbishop Tillotson's offer of ecclesiastical preferment for him in 1691, Ray felt himself free to publish on matters of religion, and compelled to do so by the nature of contemporary debate. At the instigation of Edmund Elys, he composed the devotional <span class="italic">A Persuasive to a Holy Life</span> (1700). He had always believed that &#145;Divinity is my Profession&#146;  (<span class="italic">Further Correspondence</span>, 163), and argued that &#145;I know of no occupation which is more worthy or more delightful for a free man than to contemplate the beauteous works of Nature and to honour the infinite wisdom and goodness of God the Creator&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ray's Flora</span>, 26).<br>
<br>After Ray's death his widow complained to Sloane of her straitened circumstances, estimating that she had been left only &pound;40 p.a. to support her family  (Margaret Ray to Sloane, 19 Nov 1706, BL, MS Sloane 4040, fol. 255). Ray bequeathed his papers to Dale, from whom many of them eventually passed to William Derham who published an edition of Ray's correspondence in 1718 as <span class="italic">Philosophical Letters</span>. Ray gave instructions that he should be buried privately in the churchyard at Black Notley, asking that his corpse be &#145;nailed up that none might see him&#146;  (Dale, Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. Essex 21, fol. 380<i>v</i>). His friends erected a monument over the tomb. Ray's library was sold at auction in March 1708, making up nearly 1300 lots. His writings in natural theology proved influential throughout the eighteenth century, and were echoed in the work of William Paley. Despite this, it was as a botanist that Ray achieved most lasting fame. Linnaeus was so aware of his stature that he misrepresented his views in order to cite him as a fellow proponent of classification by a single variable. He also followed Plumier in naming a genus of yams after Ray. In the twentieth century Ray's most effective biographer, Charles Raven, co-opted him in an attempt to heal the perceived breach between science and religion, deploying the concept of organic design to suggest the unfolding of divine purpose through evolution.<br>
