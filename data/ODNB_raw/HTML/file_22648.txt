<span class="headword">Powell, Sir  George Smyth  Baden-</span>  (1847&#150;1898), <span class="occ">politician and author</span>, born at Oxford on 24 December 1847, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22642/', "Professor Baden Powell (1796&#150;1860)")</script> and his third wife, Henrietta Grace (1824&#150;1914), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25961/', "Admiral William Henry Smyth")</script>. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30520/', "Major-General Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell")</script>, founder of the Boy Scouts, was his younger brother. The Powells were a large family whose wealth was earned by Sir George's great-grandfather David Powell (1725&#150;1810), a London merchant who left &pound;300,000 and fathered fourteen children. George was admitted to St Paul's School on 17 September 1858, and to Marlborough College in April 1864. Owing to a burst blood vessel suffered through strenuous sporting activity, he was obliged to leave school at midsummer 1866. He travelled abroad for three years, visiting India, Australasia, South Africa, and Spain, Portugal, Norway, and Germany. In 1872, at the age of twenty-five, he published his observations on Australia and New Zealand under the title <span class="italic">New Homes for the Old Country</span>, notable for its information on natural history. On 18 October 1871 he matriculated from Balliol College, Oxford, graduating BA in 1875 and MA in 1878. In 1876 he obtained the chancellor's prize for an English essay on the subject of <span class="italic">The Political and Social Results of the Absorption of Small Races by Large</span>. In the same year he entered the Inner Temple as a student; but in 1877 he became private secretary to Sir George Fergusson Bowen, governor of Victoria. A convinced free-trader, in 1879 he published <span class="italic">Protection and bad times with special reference to the political economy of English colonisation</span>, in which he attacked the notion that while free trade was good for a manufacturing country like England, it was unsuited to newer communities. In 1880 Baden-Powell was appointed as commissioner to inquire into the effect of the sugar bounties on West India trade, visiting the West Indies in 1880&#150;81. One outcome was his book <span class="italic">State Aid and State Interference</span> (1882), a strong protest against protection, which made use of his observations on the West Indies. In November 1882 he was appointed joint commissioner (with Colonel Sir William Crossman) to inquire into the administration, revenue, and expenditure of the West India colonies. The commission's report, completed by Easter 1884, was published in five blue books, and for his services Baden-Powell was created a KCMG in 1888. In January 1885 he went to South Africa to assist Sir Charles Warren in the pacification of Bechuanaland, afterwards making a tour of investigation of Basutoland and Zululand.<br>
<br>At the general election of November 1885 Baden-Powell was elected as a Conservative for the Kirkdale division of Liverpool, a heavily nonconformist seat created in the redistribution of 1885. He successfully held the seat at the three subsequent general elections, until his death three years after that of 1895. As a parliamentarian he was a popular local member, overcoming initial discomfort among constituents towards a &#145;carpetbagger&#146; who had no previous connections with Liverpool. His position as a strong proponent of free trade was well regarded locally, as were his imperial links and what obituary tributes described as his &#145;staunch support of the Protestant Church&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1886 Baden-Powell travelled to Canada to assist in the establishment of a line of steamers between Vancouver and Yokohama. He worked vigorously for this scheme, which was subsidized by the government and reduced the length of a journey to Japan from forty-two to twenty-two days. In 1887 he was appointed (with Sir George Bowen) special commissioner to arrange the details of the new Maltese constitution; all the recommendations of the commissioners were adopted and they received the thanks of the government.<br>
<br>During his visit to the Pacific coast of Canada in 1886 Baden-Powell had become interested in Britain and Canada's dispute with the American government over the Bering Sea fisheries, and had visited Washington on his way back to England to call attention to the question. In June 1891, when the controversy became acute, Lord Salisbury appointed him and a representative of the Canadian government to proceed to the Bering Sea to investigate the subject. The British claims were founded on their reports, and in December 1892 Baden-Powell was appointed British member of the joint commission in Washington; in the spring of 1893 he was chosen to advise those preparing the British case before arbitrators in Paris. For these services he received the thanks of parliament; and in 1892 he was made honorary LLD of Toronto University.<br>
<br>On 8 April 1893 Baden-Powell married, at Cheltenham, Frances Annie (<i>d</i>. Oct 1913), the only child of Charles Wilson of Glendowan, Cheltenham; they had a son and a daughter. Wilson had been a wealthy Australian pastoralist prior to returning to England, and was the brother of Sir Samuel Wilson, one of the richest men in Australia. An enthusiastic yachtsman, in 1896 Baden-Powell took a party of astronomers to Novaya Zemlya on his steam yacht, the <i>Ontario</i>, to observe the total eclipse of the sun on 9 August. He was also a prolific writer&#151;apart from the books already noted, he was the author of over forty articles in the leading journals of the day, such as the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span>, <span class="italic">Westminster</span>, <span class="italic">Fortnightly</span>, and <span class="italic">National</span> reviews, dealing chiefly with imperial topics. In &#145;Postal universities&#146;, published in <span class="italic">Temple Bar</span> in November 1872, he advocated a correspondence university for colonists in remote parts of the empire. He also edited <span class="italic">The Truth about Home Rule</span> (1888), a collection of essays attacking Irish nationalism, and was a frequent writer for <span class="italic">The Times</span> and other journals. Baden-Powell died of a kidney malignancy, at the age of only fifty-one, at his residence, 114 Eaton Square, London, on 20 November 1898, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
