<span class="headword">Woodall,  George</span>  (1850&#150;1925), <span class="occ">cameo glass artist</span>, was born at Barnett Lane, Kingswinford, Staffordshire, on 15 August 1850, the second son of Thomas Woodall (1827/8&#150;1898), a nail maker, and his wife, Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bott (1827/8&#150;1902), whose younger brother Thomas Bott became an important decorator at the Worcester porcelain factory. With his elder brother, Thomas Woodall (1849&#150;1925), he attended the Wordsley national (Church of England) schools until the age of twelve, when both brothers were apprenticed to the glass decorating firm of J. and J. Northwood. In 1866 they both enrolled at the Stourbridge School of Art. During their time at the Northwood works they would have been aware of, and learnt from, the engraving work of their employer John Northwood and the launch of his effort to revive the art of cameo glass. George Woodall married, on 11 February 1872, Pamela (1852&#150;1937), daughter of Joseph Parkes, a miner. They had four daughters and two sons.<br>
<br>George Woodall and his brother, Thomas, both left the Northwood works between 1874 and 1877, and by 1878 they had moved to the nearby glassworks of Thomas Webb &amp; Sons, which, under the guidance of Thomas Wilkes Webb, was to become one of the great nineteenth-century Stourbridge glass factories. When Stevens and Williams began to produce cameo glass under John Northwood's directorship, Wilkes Webb decided to set up his own cameo decorating shop and placed George and Thomas Woodall in charge of it. Until 1899 the brothers produced some work jointly and signed their work &#145;T. &amp; G. Woodall&#146;, but Thomas's greater interest in music and the church, plus family disagreements between the two, led them to abandon their joint efforts.<br>
<br>During the 1880s the amount of cameo work produced at Webbs, including vases, plaques, bowls, scent bottles, candlesticks, inkwells, and menu card holders, was enormous. To cope with demand George Woodall set up the Woodall team consisting of himself, his brother, Thomas, Tom Farmer, Harry Davies, William Hill, and J. T. Fereday. The team also had access to another seventy engravers at Webbs to do much of the repetitive task of carving the decorative borders and panels. The cameo glass produced by George and his team is some of the finest ever created, usually in two layers, but special pieces consisted of as many as seven layers. Subject matter was drawn from many sources. George's main inspiration was classical, and influences came from sculptors such as Antonio Canova; he owned a copy of <span class="italic">The Works of Antonia Canova</span> (1876) and a number of his vases can be traced to designs in that book. Other books of the time which provided floral designs included Owen Jones, <span class="italic">Examples of Chinese Ornament</span> (1867). Alongside his cameo work Woodall was also a professional photographer, recording scenes and people around Kingswinford between 1885 to 1910, but also photographing his own work, which Webbs sent to galleries and dealers to further promote it.<br>
<br>The first public exhibition of Webbs cameo glass was at the Worcestershire Exhibition in 1882. For the next thirty years their cameo work, especially by George Woodall, was shown at international exhibitions around the world, winning endless awards and gold medals including Paris (1878); Melbourne (1880); the International Health Exhibition, London (1884); the Melbourne Centennial (1888); Paris (1889); Launceston, Tasmania (1891&#150;2); Chicago (1893); the Franco-British Exhibition, London (1908); and Brussels and Turin (1910).<br>
<br>Through these exhibitions George Woodall's work became collected internationally, especially in America, and even in his own lifetime he was acknowledged as the greatest cameo carver of the period. He used the same techniques as John Northwood&#151;acid to etch away unwanted glass and steel-pointed tools for carving&#151;but he also used the copper-wheel engraving lathe to engrave details and polish the glass. His self-acknowledged masterpiece, completed in 1898, is <span class="italic">The Moorish Bathers</span> (Corning Museum of Glass), an 18 inch diameter plaque in a raisin-coloured body cased with white and carved with a scene of six female bathers surrounded by buildings not dissimilar to the Alhambra. In this stunning display of carving he shows off the two important characteristics of his work, first the white cased glass with a bluish tinge, unique to Webbs, which allowed for a greater range of shading, and second his creation of pictorial depth and perspective. Woodall's subject matter is similar to that of contemporary British and French painters including Jean L&eacute;on G&eacute;r&ocirc;me, Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, and Frederic, Lord Leighton, and he regarded himself as a fine artist and sculptor rather than as a mere decorator of glass. In 1899 his exhibition of work at the galleries of Phillips in Mount Street, London, was called &#145;Sculptured Glass&#146;. In some of his glass plaques Woodall even used Leighton's device of framing his work between classical columns and pediments, but in glass rather than wood.<br>
<br>George Woodall retired officially from Webbs in 1911 but continued to carve cameo glass for the company and for himself. His later work, from 1900 onwards, used public events for his subject matter. His admiration for Gladstone and the politician's condemnation of the atrocities against the Armenian people led him to carve two portrait medallions, one of Gladstone and one entitled <span class="italic">The Armenian Girl</span> (Dudley Museums Service). The fascination with polar exploration at the beginning of the twentieth century inspired him to create a series of three Polar Vases, the third of which, entitled <span class="italic">The Antarctic Vase</span> (Chrysler Museum), made after 1914 and possibly as late as 1918, is Woodall's final masterpiece.<br>
<br>George Woodall seems to have stopped carving glass by 1922, when the insurance on his studio was not renewed. He died on 27 February 1925 and is buried at St Mary's Church in Kingswinford. But his legacy continues undiminished. Every cameo carver since Woodall has acknowledged their debt to the master, and his creations when they appear on the open market fetch considerable prices.<br>
