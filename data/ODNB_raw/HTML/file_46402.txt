<span class="headword">Leving,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1667), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and spy</span>, was a native of co. Durham, although his parentage and early life are very obscure. He served as a junior officer in the regiment of Sir Arthur Hesilrige in the course of the civil war. In 1659&#150;60 he took the part of John Lambert in the divisions that arose in the army as the English republic began to falter, and as a consequence lost both his post, and any arrears of pay which might have been due to him. Dismissed from the army, he returned north at the Restoration, but he remained one of many unsettled former soldiers there under the new regime of Charles II.<br>
<br>Leving played a particularly prominent role in the northern plot of 1663. Alongside his father he was part of the plan to raise Durham for the rebels under Captain Roger Jones. In October 1663 any chance of a rebellion ignominiously collapsed, the conspiracy having been penetrated by government informers at an early stage. In the subsequent round-up of the participants Leving was imprisoned in York Castle. Sir Thomas Gower claimed to have &#145;two witnesses against him which will hang him upon a triall&#146;, but Leving's execution was averted by his turning king's evidence against his accomplices  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/97, fol. 41<i>v</i>); he claimed that pangs of conscience rather than fear turned him round. Sir Roger Langley, the high sheriff of Yorkshire, suggested to the earl of Arlington in April 1664 that:<blockquote>if a way could be founde to gett &hellip; [Leving] &hellip; out of the gaole soe as he might not be suspected by his owne party he might be of greate use, for he assures me if hee were out he would not question to let you knowe some of the [names of the rebel] Councell now in London.(TNA: PRO, SP 29/97, fol. 41<i>v</i>; SP 29/98, fol. 132)</blockquote>A relieved Leving accepted this offer and in May 1664 was transferred to the Tower of London. During his incarceration there he suggested that his use could be further extended by allowing him to escape and &#145;shift as a banished man&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1663&#150;4</i>, 616). His escape was arranged that same year and he promptly went to ground in London.<br>
<br>Leving was supplied with funds, albeit irregularly, and a paper revealing his status as an agent to any officious government servants whom he might meet. During the difficult period as a double agent that followed he used various aliases, including that of Leonard Williams. While ostensibly playing a major role in the many schemes of his friends, he betrayed them, passing on his information by letter and meetings with &#145;Mr. Lee&#146;, the disguised Sir Joseph Williamson. Eventually Leving overplayed his hand and began to be suspected by his fellow plotters. In February 1665 they bundled him into an obscure house, where he was held for some days and threatened with pistols. That he managed to bluster his way out and pass the blame for the recent betrayals onto someone else shows his personal coolness in a situation of great danger.<br>
<br>Over the next year Leving, with various unreliable partners, turned to more criminal activities, becoming a highwayman in an attempt to supplement his already limited finances. His criminal activities soon led to his moral decline and made him less useful to his masters. He was arrested in Leicestershire in May 1665, but released on revealing his identity. The regime then insisted that he remain in London during the plague months and as a consequence he lost most of his family to the epidemic. Lacking funds he begged for a customs post to supplement his income and to provide an excuse to stay in London in order to remain close to his erstwhile friends and victims. The latter were now becoming suspicious of his loyalties once more and in late 1666 Leving was sent to Ireland to undertake espionage work on behalf of the government. After returning to England in December 1666 he once again resorted to highway robbery, this time in Yorkshire. Once more he was arrested and again released at the intercession of Williamson. In July 1667 he was placed in the company of the heavily guarded plotter Captain John Mason, who had escaped with him in 1664. Mason had been recaptured in June 1667 and under guard Leving was sent north with him, either to provide a witness against the prisoner at his trial at York or to try to inveigle more information out of Mason. In the event Thomas Blood and his friends, intent on freeing their colleague, ambushed the group in the town of Darrington on 25 July 1667. During the rather bloody action that followed Leving hid in a nearby house and observed from a safe distance, but he had finally been recognized as a spy.<br>
<br>In August 1667 Leving lay dead in the cells of York Castle, poisoned by his enemies according to his former highway companion William Freer. He had offended his rebel friends and finally revealed his identity as a spy, and this makes them obvious suspects in his death, but he had also become involved in another scheme of note: the duke of Buckingham had been dabbling in connections with the rebel party and in 1667 Arlington, using his many informants, tried to use these activities to bring the duke down; Leving's part was apparently to act as a witness against Buckingham. As this scheme collapsed Leving was left in a dangerous situation. Although Buckingham later denied any hand in his death, the fact that he went on record to do so seems to point the finger in his general direction.<br>
<br>Leving was fairly typical of the men that the regime of Charles II recruited for espionage. His background as a plotter gave him access to his former friends and as a spy he helped to scotch some of the many schemes bubbling under the surface of dissenting and rebel life in London, assisting the regime in maintaining its upper hand in the post-revolutionary situation. In the course of his work Leving himself undoubtedly suffered a degeneration of his character. He became motivated more by fear and greed than ideology after the collapse of the abortive rebellion of 1663 and spent his later years fearful of betrayal on both sides. In the end he was poorly rewarded for his efforts by his squalid death. He was buried in York.<br>
