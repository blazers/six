<span class="headword">Foster,  Trevor John French</span>  (1914&#150;2005), <span class="occ">rugby league player</span>, was born at the Church House Inn, 14 Portland Street, Newport, Monmouthshire (the childhood home of the poet W. H. Davies), on 3 December 1914, the third son and sixth and youngest child of Richard Foster, innkeeper and former soldier, and his wife, Mabel Elizabeth Janet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bower. He was educated at St Joseph's convent school then Holy Cross School, Newport, leaving at fourteen to assist his father, whose sight was failing. He played rugby union at Holy Cross, and joined the former pupils' club Newport Hibernians in 1935, progressing via Pill Harriers to join Newport for the 1937&#150;8 season. He was an instant success as a blindside wing-forward, leading Newport's scorers with twelve tries in thirty-four matches. Within a few months he played for the Possibles in the final Welsh trial and was travelling reserve for Wales against Ireland at Swansea.<br>
<br>Noticed by rugby league scouts even while still in junior rugby, Foster was visited at the start of the 1938&#150;9 season by Harry Hornby, chairman of Bradford Northern. When Hornby put &pound;400 on the table he initially declined, keen to secure his Welsh rugby union cap and concerned about his parents and the family business. His elder sister Freda told him, &#145;What if you break your leg next Saturday? You may never again get such a chance in your life. I'll look after Mum and Dad&#146;  (Foster, Gate, and Lush, 13). He later described signing as &#145;the greatest thing I ever did&#146;  (Collins, 55). Among the last of nearly 400 Welsh players to &#145;go north&#146; between the wars, he formed a bond with Bradford that lasted long beyond his playing days.<br>
<br>Foster took rapidly to rugby league as a second row forward, finding that &#145;There was a lot more space and room to move. This suited my style of play&#146;  (Foster, Gate, and Lush, 18). Conscripted in 1940 into the King's Own Yorkshire light infantry, he joined the Army Physical Training Corps as a sergeant-instructor. Successive postings in Yorkshire allowed him, until posted to Egypt early in 1945, to continue playing rugby league with great success. Trophyless since 1906, Bradford won championships in 1940 and 1941 and the challenge cup in 1944. He also played for Wales in five rugby league internationals and, under the wartime dispensation allowing league players in the services to play union, seven union internationals. He also played in two league versus union matches played under union rules but won by the professional code.<br>
<br>Demobilized in 1946, Foster went that year with the first post-war Great Britain touring team, known as the Indomitables after the aircraft carrier on which they travelled, to Australia and New Zealand. Injury ruled him out of the Ashes tests but the captain, Gus Risman, reckoned him &#145;the most popular member of the party&#146;  (Foster, Gate, and Lush, 174) and he received, and declined, an offer to emigrate and play for South Sydney. Instead, aged thirty-one, though claiming (as he would until very old) to be two years younger, he returned to a leading role in Bradford's unprecedented feat of playing in three consecutive challenge cup finals at Wembley (1947&#150;9). Foster scored tries in the two victories, in 1947 and 1949. On 13 June 1949 he married, at St Patrick's Church, Westgate, Bradford, Jean Florence Unsworth, a 23-year-old nurse from Bradford, and daughter of Leonard Unsworth, assistant racing manager. They had four children, Simon, Jane, Sara, and Bridget, and for five years from the late 1950s fostered Joseph Elston. They separated in the mid-1970s.<br>
<br>Always a prolific try-scorer by forward standards&#151;his career total of 144 remained at his death a record for a Welsh forward&#151;Foster peaked with twenty-two in 1947&#150;8, including six in one match against Wakefield Trinity. Contemporaries admired his mix of power and pace with subtlety and fine judgement. The New Zealander Cecil Mountford called him &#145;one of the greatest forwards it has been my pleasure to watch&#146;, noting his &#145;ability to hold the ball until he could part with it to advantage and to take the tackle if such was inevitable, rather than let a colleague do so&#146;  (Foster, Gate, and Lush, 87 and 169).<br>
<br>Foster retired in 1955 after 432 matches for Bradford, 16 for Wales (including 7 as captain), and 3 Great Britain tests. By then he was the club's assistant coach and had been, in 1949, rugby league's first national coaching organizer before resigning to concentrate on his playing duties. In 1958 he became a director at Bradford and in 1960 chief coach, resigning both posts at the end of 1960 when significant decisions were made without consulting him. In 1963 Bradford went out of business. Foster, now coaching at Leeds after a short spell with Keighley, and his former team-mate Joe Phillips drove the public campaign that led to the club's re-formation and readmission to the rugby league in 1964. The local paper said that &#145;but for his enthusiasm &hellip; it is doubtful that the club would exist today&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 6 April 2005). This was the most public expression of a remarkable record of service to his adopted community&#151;as an education welfare officer from 1957 to 1981, youth sports coach, and active supporter of the Bradford Police Club for Young People&#151;that earned copious recognition late in life. He was the first recipient (in 1998) of the lord mayor of Bradford's lifetime achievement award, appointed MBE in 2001, and awarded an honorary doctorate by Bradford University in 2002, the same year that a road near Bradford's Odsal Stadium was named Trevor Foster Way.<br>
<br>Foster remained a vigorous and genial presence at Bradford matches, acting as timekeeper from 1986 until 2004. Aged eighty-nine he had to be dissuaded, on a wet day when he had no raincoat, from accompanying charity walkers on the Bradford leg of a trek around rugby league grounds. Only three days before his death he attended the launch of a book celebrating his life. A lifelong Catholic, he appeared as Christ in a 1956 pageant at Odsal and in 2001 received the Benemeriti medal from Pope John Paul II for his work in the church. He died on 2 April 2005, the same day as the pope, in Bradford Royal Infirmary following a heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Jean, two daughters, and a son, his daughter Jane having died in 1992.<br>
