<span class="headword">Montmorency,  James Edward Geoffrey  de</span>  (1866&#150;1934), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was born at Greenwich on 6 December 1866, the third son of James Lodge de Montmorency, a member of the hospital staff there, and his wife, Susan Kiddel. Educated at Blackheath proprietary school, he was admitted to Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1886, and graduated BA in 1889 and LLB in 1890; in 1909 he was awarded the Seatonian prize for an English poem on a sacred subject. In 1892 he was called to the bar by the Middle Temple and went into chambers on the Chancery side. He married in 1899 Caroline Maud Saumarez, third daughter of Major-General James de Havilland; they had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Having a strong inclination towards the more academic aspects of the law, at an early stage in his career de Montmorency was inspired with enthusiasm for comparative legal studies by the influence of John Macdonell, Quain professor of comparative law in the University of London. In 1902 he was Quain prizeman in comparative law at University College, London, and in 1911 and 1912 King Edward VII legal research scholar of the Middle Temple. In 1920 he succeeded Macdonell as Quain professor and he held the chair until his retirement in 1932. From 1930 to 1932 he was also dean of the faculty of laws in the University of London.<br>
<br>De Montmorency's activities covered a wide area and, in addition to those already mentioned, he was for many years literary editor of the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>. He acted as assistant secretary of the royal commission on divorce and matrimonial causes from 1910 to 1912, and from 1918 to 1920 as joint secretary and member of the attorney-general's committee of inquiry into breaches of the laws of war. He was a prolific writer, but much of his published work is of a somewhat miscellaneous and transient character. He was one of the principal contributors to the series of monographs published by the Society of Comparative Legislation under the title of <span class="roman">Great Jurists of the World</span>, and he wrote the section &#145;Sea-policy and the <i>Alabama</i> claims&#146; in the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of British Foreign Policy</span>, volume 3 (1923). Selections of the articles which he contributed to <span class="italic">The Times</span> and the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> were published under the titles of <span class="italic">The Never-Ending Road</span> (1916), <span class="italic">The White Riders</span> (1918), and <span class="italic">The Admiral's Chair</span> (1921).<br>
<br>De Montmorency met with considerable success as a teacher of the law. He was of a warm-hearted and generous disposition, which endeared him to students, and he was untiring in his efforts to assist them. A keen churchman, he was invaluable as a governor and manager of church schools. He died at his home, 31 Lee Terrace, Blackheath, on 9 March 1934; he was survived by his wife.<br>
