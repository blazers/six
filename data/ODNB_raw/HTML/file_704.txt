<span class="headword">Arthur</span>, duke of Brittany  (1187&#150;1203), <span class="occ">prince</span>, was the posthumous son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10533/', "Geoffrey, duke of Brittany (d. 1186)")</script>, fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12949/', "Henry II")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46701/', "Constance, duchess of Brittany (c.1161&#150;1201)")</script>. He was born at Nantes on Easter day (29 March) 1187. Despite his grandfather's wish that he should be called Henry he was baptized Arthur, to the general approval of his Breton subjects who rejoiced greatly at his birth. They recognized in this allusion to his legendary namesake a bold assertion by Constance and her advisers of their desire to be free from Plantagenet domination. But since Arthur was Henry II's only legitimate male grandson to date in the direct line, whatever hopes they may have entertained for independence, his life inevitably had wider horizons than Brittany alone.<br>
<br>The circumstances of Arthur's earliest infancy can only be surmised; at first he remained with his mother, with whom he developed close and lasting mutual bonds of affection. But he was quickly caught up in international politics. After the death of Henry II <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23498/', "Richard I")</script> took a close personal interest in Brittany. He treated Arthur and his surviving sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46702/', "Eleanor of Brittany (d. 1241)")</script>, as wards, and had no compunction in using them for diplomatic ends. In negotiating terms for Arthur's marriage to a daughter of Tancred, king of Sicily, at Messina in October 1190, he did, however, recognize his nephew as his own heir, a decision which some have seen as a device for keeping his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14841/', "John's")</script> ambitions under control while he was absent on crusade. In the same year rumours also circulated about a secret treaty between William de Longchamp (<i>d</i>. 1197) and William the Lion of Scotland (<i>d</i>. 1214), Arthur's maternal great-uncle, which favoured Arthur's claims against those of John. The rivalry of Arthur and John was subsequently an important leitmotif in the politics of the Angevin dominions, although John's ambitions were temporarily shackled during his brother's absence by the decision of Philip Augustus of France to recognize Arthur as Richard's man, holding the latter answerable for Brittany.<br>
<br>After returning from prison Richard tried to reassert his control. Early in 1196, probably as a ruse, he summoned Constance to his court in Normandy. She was captured <i>en route</i> by her estranged second husband, Ranulf (III), earl of Chester (<i>d</i>. 1232), who imprisoned her in his castle of St James-de-Beuvron. The king then demanded that the Bretons place Arthur in his keeping. When they refused, he invaded the duchy. The boy was kept safe at first in the care of Gu&eacute;thenoc, bishop of Vannes, who hid him. But Richard's sudden arrival in force in northern Brittany at Easter 1196 persuaded Arthur's well-wishers to send him to the French court. Here he kept company with his close contemporary Louis, heir to the throne. Later, after Constance's escape from captivity, hostilities in Brittany ceased and a new <i>modus vivendi</i> with Richard was reached which allowed Arthur to return. From 1197 the duchess involved him in government. He was still well under age, but actions attributed to him begin to appear in chronicles. In August 1198 he renounced his fealty to Philip and agreed to be guided in relations with him by Richard; it is clear however that there were also ambitious barons prepared to exploit him unscrupulously.<br>
<br>The death of Richard I in April 1199 was a turning point in Arthur's life. Rules for succession differed throughout Richard's lands in France and even in England, where Arthur's right to the throne was vigorously asserted at the time of John's coronation. Among those who opposed it was William Marshal (<i>d</i>. 1219), who urged its rejection because of the evil counsellors who surrounded Arthur, and because of Arthur's own pride and deviousness. Just over a week after Richard's death Arthur's supporters in Maine and Anjou were able to take possession of Angers. Here on Easter day (18 April) 1199 Arthur issued a charter for Pontron Abbey and quickly appointed Guillaume des Roches seneschal of Anjou. Soon afterwards Philip, skilfully exploiting Plantagenet disarray, accepted Arthur's homage for Anjou, Maine, Touraine, and Brittany, although his partisans soon had to fight hard to retain control. In late May Arthur was driven out of Tours by Aimery, vicomte de Thouars, and had to retreat to Le Mans, recently devastated by John.<br>
<br>During the summer fighting continued, until Philip and John met to parley on 17 August 1199, when the French king asked for Poitou, in addition to Anjou, Maine, and Touraine, for Arthur. Next month John agreed to come to terms with Arthur and gave pledges to Guillaume des Roches. When Philip, continuing the war, took Ballon in Maine and refused to hand it over, Guillaume, described by Roger of Howden as &#145;leader of Arthur's army&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronica &hellip; Hovedene</span>, 4.96), decided to make his own terms with John, and delivered Arthur and Le Mans into his keeping. After a brief and harsh confinement Arthur and his mother managed to escape, and re-established contact with Philip, who shortly afterwards came to Tours and took Arthur back into wardship. When a few months later the French king reached agreement with John in the treaty of Le Goulet (22 May 1200), he conceded that Arthur, deprived of wider territories, should perform homage to John for Brittany, although he was to remain in Philip's custody, and efforts were made to protect his rights as duke.<br>
<br>Arthur's whereabouts in 1200&#150;01 are largely unknown; he clearly spent some time at the French royal court, where he took part in a tournament celebrating the betrothal of Louis, the royal heir, to Blanche of Castile. But he also resided for a while with his mother and her third husband, Guy de Thouars, in Brittany, where his consent to grants to the abbeys of Melleray and St Sulpice-la-For&ecirc;t is noted, while the &#145;safety and prosperity of the soul of my dearest son&#146; was in the forefront of Constance's mind when she endowed the abbey of Villeneuve shortly before her death in September 1201  (Morice, 1.785&#150;6). In the same year Arthur acted alone in dispatching envoys to inform the archbishop of Tours that he accepted a definitive papal ruling depriving the bishopric of Dol of its long-cherished claim to metropolitan status.<br>
<br>When John summoned him to perform homage again a week after Easter 1202, Arthur rejoined Philip, to whose six-year-old daughter, Marie, he was then betrothed. Following the sentence of forfeiture pronounced against John on 28 April, he accompanied the French king's army on campaign in Normandy. At Gournay in July, where the king knighted him, as &#145;Arthur, duke of Brittany and Aquitaine, count of Anjou and Maine&#146;  (Teulet, 1, no. 647), he performed homage for the lands newly conferred on him (but still to be conquered) following their confiscation from John. He was then immediately dispatched with a small force to Poitou, where a revolt in his favour had broken out, but where his aged grandmother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8618/', "Eleanor of Aquitaine (d. 1204)")</script> continued to sustain John's cause. He cornered her at Mirebeau, where on 1 August he was captured when John, after a dramatic forced march from Normandy, took him entirely off guard and made many of his powerful supporters prisoner.<br>
<br>Some, including Arthur's sister Eleanor, were dispatched to England, where she remained a captive until her death in 1241, but Arthur was confined at Falaise. No clear account can be given of his last months, nor of the manner and time of his death, but the broad outlines are tolerably established. Initially John was prepared to consider negotiating terms for his release; on 24 August safe conducts were issued for Breton envoys to come to his court. But when in the autumn Arthur remained a prisoner, his supporters again rose in rebellion in Brittany and elsewhere. By March 1203 they were prepared to perform homage to Philip on condition that if Arthur was released they might return to his allegiance. Simultaneously ugly rumours about the harsh conditions in which he was kept began circulating. We owe to Ralph of Coggeshall, for instance, the story, later used by Shakespeare as the crux of his <span class="italic">King John</span>, of John's ordering Arthur's mutilation at Falaise Castle, so that he would no longer be capable or considered worthy of ruling. He was allegedly saved by Hubert de Burgh (<i>d</i>. 1243), who heeded the prisoner's piteous complaints and refused to obey the king's orders. Other chroniclers relate that when he was moved to Rouen, Arthur was in sound health, though William (III) de Briouze is reported as saying, when he delivered him into John's hands, that he would no longer answer for his safety.<br>
<br>In all probability it is from Briouze that the most explicit statements on the date and manner of Arthur's death derive, for he appears to have been the common source for details later found only in the Margam annals and in the <span class="italic">Philippidos</span> of Guillaume le Breton. These relate how on Maundy Thursday (3 April) 1203, coming suddenly to Rouen, a frenzied John struck Arthur dead with a large stone and tossed his body into the Seine, whence it was recovered by fishermen and secretly buried at the priory of Ste Marie-des-Pr&eacute;s. For Briouze was a patron of Margam, was at Rouen with John at the time in question, and was later driven into exile in France where he died in 1211, after his wife, who had refused to place her own children in John's hands as hostages for fear of their meeting Arthur's fate, was horribly starved to death by the vengeful king. In any event, whether killed in this fashion or drowned through John's agency as other accounts suggest, Arthur was not certainly seen alive again, though his supporters long hoped he might be. In Brittany his succession passed to his half-sister, Alix, the daughter of Constance and Guy de Thouars.<br>
