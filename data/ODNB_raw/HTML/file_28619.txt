<span class="headword">Walsh,  William</span>  (1511/12?&#150;1577), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic bishop of Meath</span>, is better documented than many other Irish martyrs, although parts of his career are shrouded in mystery. According to a letter he wrote towards the end of his life, he was probably born in 1511 or 1512; otherwise little is certain regarding his early years. His parentage is unrecorded, though it is known that he was conceived within wedlock. Some sources, composed in the early to mid-seventeenth century, claim he was born in Meath, at Dunboyne; others, written at about the same time, make Waterford his birthplace. The case for his being a native of Meath is supported by a papal document of the 1550s that refers to him as a priest of Meath, &#145;sacerdotis Midensis&#146;  (Moran, 131).<br>
<br>Confusion also surrounds Walsh's early career in the church. Although it is indisputable that as a young man he joined the Cistercian order, it is not certain which Cistercian monastery he entered. It is often claimed that he joined the community at Bective Abbey, Meath, and stayed there until the abbey was dissolved by officials of Henry VIII. However, this is contradicted by the fact that his name does not appear among the documents of the dissolution pertaining to Bective. Instead, government records mention a &#145;William Walsh&#146; as resident at another Cistercian house, St Mary's Abbey in Dublin, when it was dissolved in October 1539. If this is the same William as the future bishop, then he was granted a pension of &pound;10 by the Henrician government in recompense for his loss of position.<br>
<br>The sequence of Walsh's subsequent movements is difficult to disentangle. All that is certain is that in the fifteen or so years before his nomination to the bishopric of Meath in 1554 he refused to reach an accommodation with the royal government while it remained in schism. He visited Rome, studied at a European university (possibly Rome, but certainly not Oxford, as is sometimes claimed) and became a doctor of divinity, and received a papal appointment as guardian of Duleek Priory and rector of Loughseedy in the diocese of Meath. While in Italy he is reputed to have been a chaplain or follower of Cardinal Reginald Pole. In order to attain his position at Duleek, an Augustinian house, he obtained a special dispensation from Rome to become an Augustinian canon, a record of which survives in the papal archives; curiously, no Cistercian writer of the sixteenth or seventeenth century acknowledges that Walsh changed orders. Most likely he was granted Duleek in order to minister to the Meath Catholic community as the Church of Ireland moved from schism to open protestant heresy.<br>
<br>Soon after the accession of Mary I in 1553 Walsh emerged to play a leading role in church and state in Ireland. In April 1554 he agreed to serve, at his own cost, as one of three commissioners chosen to proceed against protestant clergymen&#151;significantly, not on the grounds of their being heretics, but because they were married, &#145;cohabiting&#146; contrary to canon law. It was a strategy that conformed with Pole's policy of restoring papal control by concentrating on clerical behaviour instead of belief. By 29 June the commission had had its desired effect, facilitating the deprivation of the Church of Ireland bishop of Meath, Edward Staples. Immediately, Walsh was nominated as Staples's replacement. He was elected to the vacant see in accordance with a <i>cong&eacute; d'&eacute;lire</i> directed to the archdeacon and chapter of Meath by the crown, and by August he had received royal letters patent authorizing his consecration. Before he could be consecrated, however, Walsh needed to have his position confirmed by Rome &#145;like other bishops&#146;, and in a petition to Philip and Mary he explained that he had been too busy with other church business to attend to this. Papal recognition of his appointment arrived in September in the form of an official <i>relatio</i>, a document which also noted his ongoing association with the Augustinians. Some historians have contended that Walsh held his bishopric by royal authority only, not papal, but the <i>relatio</i> contradicts this view. Although it was July 1555 before Cardinal Pole was made papal legate to Ireland, he had power to appoint Walsh in 1554. The bishopric of Meath, the <i>relatio</i> states, &#145;though situated in Ireland is looked on as an English see&#146;; accordingly it fell within Pole's English legatine jurisdiction  (Moran, 412&#150;13). Late in the autumn of 1554, acting at the request of Queen Mary, who recognized his superior authority in the matter, Pole issued a licence for the consecration of William Walsh, bishop-elect of Meath. The consecration occurred some time after 18 October, on which date Walsh was also granted the temporalities of his see by the royal government.<br>
<br>As bishop of Meath, Walsh assumed a major role in secular affairs as a member of the Irish privy council. On occasions this necessitated his involvement in military business, despite his being a cleric: in June 1556 he undertook personally to prepare eight archers on horseback for a hosting against the Scots in Ulster; and as a matter of course he put his signature to proclamations imposing martial law and the death penalty on idlemen, vagabonds, and other offenders. Only in February 1557 did he exhibit any discomfort with this situation. A declaration of war having been drafted against a midland chieftain, Walsh and the archbishop of Dublin together felt compelled to add a postscript in the council minutes expressing their general consent &#145;to all thinges&#146; contained in the proclamation, &#145;saving what toucheth the lief of man, whiche we forbeare to do lest we shulde incurre the daunger of irregularitie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Haliday MSS</span>, 29&#150;30).<br>
<br>Involvement in government did not prevent Walsh from performing his episcopal duties successfully. Even before he assumed the bishopric the gentry of Meath had signalled their aversion to protestant doctrine, angrily rejecting his predecessor, Staples, for denying them the sacrificial mass. Walsh built on this foundation, and the continuing attachment of the diocese to Catholicism became his most lasting achievement. All his other triumphs were overthrown, however, following the death of Queen Mary in November 1558 and the succession of her protestant half-sister, Elizabeth I. Walsh vigorously opposed the return of protestantism. Within weeks of Elizabeth's accession he was reported as railing against the schismatic doctrines of Henry VIII, a dangerous instance of <i>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</i> under the new order; and early in 1559 he was identified by Lord Deputy Sussex as one of two prelates most likely to oppose new ecclesiastical legislation in parliament. For a time he was allowed to remain as bishop and a council member, but his continued defence of the Marian religious settlement soon brought about his deprivation and imprisonment. On 4 February 1560, having struggled in vain to obstruct the passage of the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, he was asked to take the oath of supremacy. He refused, and by May he had been deprived of his see.<br>
<br>Following his deprivation Walsh disappears from extant records for long stretches of time, probably because he was under restraint. It is impossible to ascertain the amount of time he spent in prison. In later life, having escaped to France, he claimed he had been thirteen years a prisoner, but this comment cannot be taken at face value; a letter written in 1563 reported that Walsh had spent a year in prison for the sake of his faith during 1560&#150;61, but had recently been restored to his freedom. Unlike other Marian clergy he refused to embrace a quiet life under Elizabeth. A habitual offender against the royal supremacy, he was constantly in and out of gaol. A letter by the Church of Ireland archbishop responsible for his punishment gives a sense of the government's frustration with him:<blockquote>Ever since the parliament he hath manifestly contemned and openly showed himself to be a misliker of all the queen's proceedings: he openly protested before all the people &hellip; that he would never communicate or be present where the Protestant service should be ministered; for it was against his conscience and against God's word. (Loftus to Cecil, 16 July 1564, TNA: PRO, SP 63/14/22)</blockquote>Worse, his stance brought him &#145;great credit amongst his countrymen&#146;  (ibid.) and prevented his protestant replacement in Meath, Hugh Brady, from making converts; the only way to silence him was to lock him up.<br>
<br>Walsh's arrest on 13 July 1565 seems to have instigated a lengthier period in prison than before, for when he next appears in documents, in 1567, he was still in Dublin Castle, smuggling letters to clergy in Lord Slane's household in the pale and to Pole's old friend, Cardinal Morone, on the continent. Some time thereafter he was released again, perhaps as early as the spring of 1569, when he is known to have signed an Irish petition to Philip II seeking Spanish military assistance against &#145;the accursed and contagious heresy&#146; of the English  (Binchy, 365&#150;6). He was definitely at liberty before Michaelmas 1570, when, at a time of political crisis, the commissioners for ecclesiastical causes moved to restrict his movements, confining him to certain counties and towns in the pale and ordering him not to speak or write against the established church. Evidently he paid as much attention to these conditions as to earlier ones: by 21 March 1572 he had been returned to the cells of Dublin Castle where, his health declining, he was given a servant to attend him.<br>
<br>At Christmas 1572 Walsh escaped, through the efforts of his friends&#151;unfortunately unnamed&#151;slipping out of Dublin Castle and taking a ship to France. Sailing in rough seas in the middle of winter the voyage took sixteen days, finally ending, he later claimed, when the ship was wrecked off the Brittany coast. At some stage he wrote to the pope from Flanders, and he stayed in Nantes for several months before the papal nuncio helped him to reach Paris in July 1573. From there he penned a letter that was destined to form the basis of subsequent efforts of the Irish Catholic church to have him recognized as a martyr for the faith. In it he gave an exaggerated account of his sufferings while in prison: as well as claiming he had been thirteen years in gaol, confined to &#145;a subterraneous dungeon, damp and noisome&#146;, he described his treatment as cruel, and blamed it for his growing infirmities (Moran, 131; Brady, 2.337). Roman Catholic writers from the seventeenth century onwards have contended that his prison experience precipitated his death, yet he was strong enough to travel to Spain in 1574, to serve as suffragan to the archbishop of Toledo, and to return briefly to Ireland to oversee the provinces of Armagh and Dublin during the absence of the Roman Catholic primate, Richard Creagh. A more satisfactory explanation for his death is suggested by his last letter, written from Alcal&aacute; in Spain in 1576, in which he begged the cardinal of Como to procure him a position in Brittany as, owing to his advanced years, he could no longer endure the severe temperatures of central Spain. He died at Alcal&aacute; on 2 January 1577 and was buried there at the Cistercian collegiate church of St Secundinus three days later.<br>
