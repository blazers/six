<span class="headword">Moulton,  James Hope</span>  (1863&#150;1917), <span class="occ">biblical and Zoroastrian scholar</span>, the elder son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19432/', "Revd William Fiddian Moulton (1835&#150;1898)")</script>, biblical scholar and headmaster of the Leys School, Cambridge, and his wife, Hannah, daughter of the Revd Samuel Hope, was born at the Wesleyan Institution, Richmond, Surrey, on 11 October 1863. His father was one of four brothers, all eminent, the best-known being <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35132/', "John Fletcher Moulton, Lord Moulton")</script>, lord justice of appeal. James Moulton was educated at the Leys School from 1875, and then at King's College, Cambridge, of which he was a fellow from 1888 to 1894. Many of his family were Methodist preachers and missionaries; he entered the Wesleyan Methodist ministry in 1886, being appointed assistant to his father at the Leys. In 1890 he married Eliza Keeling Osborn (<i>d</i>. 1915), granddaughter of George Osborn. They had two sons and two daughters; the elder son, Ralph, was killed in action in France in 1916. Moulton left Cambridge in 1902 on his appointment as <span class="roman">New Testament</span> tutor at Didsbury College, Manchester. In 1908 he was appointed Greenwood professor of Hellenistic Greek and Indo-European philology in the University of Manchester. His outstanding work here was recognized by the award of doctorates from the universities of Edinburgh, Durham, Berlin, and Gr&ouml;ningen. After his wife's death in 1915, he went to India to lecture to the Parsis on Zoroastrianism, and to qualify himself to write a volume, which was posthumously published (1917) under the title <span class="italic">The Treasure of the Magi</span>. He left India in March 1917 and joined James Rendel Harris at Port Said. Their ship was torpedoed off Corsica. Moulton &#145;played a hero's part in the boat&#146;, died from exhaustion on 7 April, and was buried at sea, a heroic story which captured the imagination of his generation.<br>
<br>Moulton's interests were wide, but his best work was done on the Greek of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and on Zoroastrianism. A <span class="italic">Grammar of New Testament Greek</span>, originally intended to be jointly written by Moulton and his father, was not begun until after his father's death and remained unfinished at the death of the son. The first volume, the <span class="italic">Prolegomena</span> (1906), was the only one published in his lifetime; but the greater part of the second volume had been written and it was published under the editorship of Wilbert Howard. Moulton's <span class="italic">Grammar of New Testament Greek</span> was a development of an approach taken by the biblical scholar Adolf Deissmann. In his <span class="italic">Bibelstudien</span>, Deissmann had published a mass of evidence to show that the vocabulary of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> did not belong to a class by itself, but was to be put in the same category as the ordinary spoken Greek of the time, as preserved in the non-literary papyri. Moulton accepted his demonstration and applied it to the grammar. A well-regarded contemporary, Adolf Harnack, professor of church history in Berlin, spoke of him as &#145;the foremost expert in <span class="roman">New Testament</span> Greek&#146;. Moulton hoped to prepare for English readers an edition of Deissmann's projected lexicon; and he lived long enough to see the publication (1914&#150;15) of two instalments of the <span class="italic">Vocabulary of the Greek Testament</span>, which he prepared in collaboration with George Milligan. His premature death meant that a projected third volume of his <span class="italic">Grammar</span>, devoted to the syntax of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, had to be brought to fruition by another scholar, Nigel Turner, in 1963.<br>
<br>Moulton's study of comparative philology led him to Sanskrit and Iranian; and from the language of the <span class="roman">Avesta</span> he naturally passed to the religion. In this field he owed much to the teaching of Edward Byles Cowell, professor of Sanskrit at Cambridge. As well as articles, he published four books on the religion. <span class="italic">Early Religious Poetry of Persia</span> (1911) was an admirable introduction to the subject, and with it may be coupled <span class="italic">The Teaching of Zarathushtra</span> (1917), lectures delivered to the Parsis. His most important contribution was made in his Hibbert lectures, <span class="italic">Early Zoroastrianism</span> (1913). He was inclined to push back the date of Zarathustra several generations before the traditional date of 660&#150;583 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>; and he sought to disengage the true Zoroastrian elements in the <span class="roman">Avesta</span> from accretions which he attributed to the magi. The subject is discussed again in the first part of <span class="italic">The Treasure of the Magi</span>. It is on this work that his posthumous reputation among Zoroastrian and Avestan scholars largely rests. It was the first work in English to argue that the <span class="roman">Avesta</span> had its own internal history, and to initiate a line of scholarly investigation (directly continued for at least the next fifty years) which attempted to show how the doctrines of the religion's founder had been modified in the later parts of the <span class="roman">Avesta</span>. Moulton was an enthusiast for Zarathustra, and for his teaching, which he regarded as the purest form of non-biblical religion. His scholarship was well regarded by the Parsi community.<br>
<br>Though a scholar of the highest quality and exceptional range Moulton was deeply interested in practical questions. Foreign missions, social reforms at home, and Christian apologetics were always very near his heart. He was eminent for the strength, the loftiness, and beauty of his character, and for the intensity of his religion.<br>
