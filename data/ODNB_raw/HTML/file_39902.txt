</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Berkeley, Sir  Lennox Randal Francis</span>  (1903&#150;1989), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 12 May 1903 at Melford Cottage, Boars Hill, near Oxford, the younger child and only son of Captain Hastings George FitzHardinge Berkeley RN (1855&#150;1934) (the eldest son of George Lennox Rawdon Berkeley, seventh earl of Berkeley) and his wife, Aline Carla (1863&#150;1935), daughter of Sir James Charles Harris, former British consul in Monaco. His father did not succeed as eighth earl of Berkeley because Captain Berkeley's parents were unmarried until prior to the birth of their third son, who succeeded to the earldom. After early schooling in Oxford, Lennox Berkeley was educated at Gresham's School in Holt, Norfolk, St George's School in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, and Merton College, Oxford, where he coxed the college rowing eight and took a fourth class in French (1926). He became an honorary fellow of Merton in 1974.<br>
<br>Berkeley had shown no outstanding musical abilities at school (though a contemporary remembers him playing the piano with much flourishing of hands), but while at Oxford he had several of his compositions performed and eventually made up his mind to be a composer. In this he was supported by the young British conductor Anthony Bernard, who later conducted first performances of a number of Berkeley's early works.<br>
<br>On advice from Maurice Ravel, Berkeley went to Paris in the autumn of 1926 to study with Nadia Boulanger, and stayed with her for six years. For the first of these she allowed him to do nothing but counterpoint exercises, a discipline which often reduced him to tears at the time, but for which he was to remain grateful all his life. He had works performed in Paris and London, and his <span class="italic">Polka for Two Pianos</span> (1934) was a notable success, inaugurating his ties with the publishers J. and W. Chester. But the BBC broadcast of his oratorio <span class="italic">Jonah</span> (1935) in 1936 and the Leeds festival performance of it the following year led many critics to look at him askance as a purveyor of modernism. From 1932 to 1934 he lived on the Riviera with his invalid mother.<br>
<br>In 1936 Berkeley met Benjamin Britten and the two became close friends, sharing a house in Snape, Suffolk, just before the Second World War. Although rather daunted by what he felt to be Britten's superior talent, Berkeley was able to find a distinctive voice in the <span class="italic">Serenade for Strings</span> (1939), the first symphony (1940), and the <span class="italic">Divertimento</span> (1943). From 1942 to 1945 he worked for the BBC, first in Bedford and then in London, as an orchestral programme planner. The authorities noted with dismay that when he was labouring on a commission his BBC work suffered, and he was happy to accept an appointment as professor of composition at the Royal Academy of Music in 1946. He remained in the post until 1968 and numbered many of the country's best composers among his pupils, including David Bedford, Peter Dickinson, William Mathias, Nicholas Maw, and John Tavener. On 14 December 1946 he married Elizabeth Freda, daughter of Isaac Bernstein, a retired shopkeeper. They had three sons, of whom the eldest, Michael Berkeley, became a composer.<br>
<br>Until he succumbed to Alzheimer's disease in the early 1980s, Berkeley produced a succession of works which made him many friends and earned him admirers in the musical community, even if he never became famous outside it. He wrote for performers such as the pianist Colin Horsley, the oboist Janet Craxton, and the guitarist Julian Bream, and he produced a considerable body of fine chamber music. He was particularly at home with the voice, and his vocal and choral works, such as <span class="italic">Four Poems of St Teresa of Avila</span> (1947), the <span class="italic">Stabat mater</span> (1947), and <span class="italic">The Hill of the Graces</span> (1975), show a love and understanding of words at least equal to Britten's. His four operas&#151;<span class="italic">A Dinner Engagement</span> (1954), <span class="italic">Nelson</span> (1954), <span class="italic">Ruth</span> (1956), and <span class="italic">Castaway</span> (1967)&#151;display at times an individual view of what constitutes opera, and one which critics and impresarios have not always shared; certainly he was not always fortunate with his librettists. But <span class="italic">Nelson</span> suffered from less than adequate performances in London and deserves to be revived. From the late 1960s Berkeley, like many composers, experimented with serial techniques and, though they never took over his music, he admitted that thanks to them his musical language had expanded. The third symphony (1969) is perhaps his most impressive exercise in this new vein. In the 1970s he still remained true to his principles of writing, with performance in mind and never <i>in vacuo</i>. When his last illness struck he was working on a fifth opera, <span class="italic">Faldon Park</span>.<br>
<br>In 1959 Berkeley said: &#145;I know quite well I'm a minor composer, and I don't mind that&#146;. It is true that he was not an Arnold Schoenberg or an Igor Stravinsky. His music made no revolutionary claims, partly because revolutionaries have to be destroyers and Berkeley was too respectful of tradition to set about it with a hatchet. If his studies with Boulanger taught him to be at ease with counterpoint, they also inculcated a love of &#145;la grande ligne&#146;, which Boulanger had inherited from Gabriel Faur&eacute;. His music, like Faur&eacute;'s, eschews surprises and, for the most part, grand gestures (though, again, <span class="italic">Nelson</span> showed what he could achieve in this more public, extrovert manner). His colleague Edmund Rubbra referred to his work as offering &#145;so much in sanity and honesty of purpose&#146;. These attributes were in general misprized in the twentieth century, and Berkeley's refusal to jettison them meant that his reputation likewise matured without sudden surprises. He was notable for attending to the needs of the amateur: it is unusual, for example, to come across a flautist who has not at some time played his sonatina. But his larger works, though always expertly written, demand patience and close attention to be fully appreciated. Even if his music always remains basically tonal, it can sometimes be fierce and gritty, very often as a result of his essentially linear thinking. Perhaps too much has been made of the Frenchness of his music, and too often critics have used this as an excuse to deny his work profundity, but at the very least he managed to avoid the vapid pastoral meanderings of some of his English predecessors. The history of twentieth-century music may not have been greatly changed by his passing across it, but without him it would have been immeasurably the poorer. He was a man dedicated, as his pupil Peter Dickinson has said, to &#145;passing on the love of music as a spiritual imperative in a foreign, material age&#146;. He was appointed CBE in 1957 and knighted in 1974. Among many other honours were the papal knighthood of St Gregory (1973), honorary membership of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters (1980), honorary doctorates of music from Oxford University (1970) and City University in London (1983), and an honorary fellowship of the Royal Northern College of Music, Manchester (1976). He also served as president of the Performing Right Society (1975&#150;83), the Composers' Guild of Great Britain (from 1975), and the Cheltenham festival (1977&#150;83).<br>
<br>Berkeley was, above all, graceful: he had been a good tennis player in his youth and remained all his life a tireless walker. As with his music, there was no hint of otiose flesh, but rather of a strength which he was careful to hide beneath beautiful manners. As well as being a kind and approachable man, he was always quick to see the funny side of things. During his time with Boulanger, he and Igor Markevich were members of a mildly disruptive &#145;back row&#146;, while in later life an eye would twinkle in response to persons on committees who treated &#145;criteria&#146; as a singular noun or interposed with, &#145;Mr Chairman, I have a trepidation about that one&#146;. Although determined to do what he saw as his civic duty, he never courted public notice unless forced by the strength of his own opinions. He had become a Roman Catholic in 1928 (when he took the name Francis) and, in the wake of the Second Vatican Council, wrote in the press urging the retention of the Tridentine mass, since he believed the authorities were ignoring a legitimate desire expressed by a large body of the Roman Catholic laity. In private he wrote of those &#145;for whom the overthrow of the old tradition appears to be an end in itself&#146;, an end which, in religion as in music, he was unable to approve. Berkeley died in St Charles's Hospital, Ladbroke Grove, London, on 26 December 1989. His ashes were scattered at Cap Ferrat, France. A memorial service was held on 20 March 1990 at Westminster Cathedral.<br>
