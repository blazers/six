<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lowe,  Elias Avery</span>  (1879&#150;1969), <span class="occ">palaeographer</span>, was born on 15 October 1879 in Moscow, Russia, the son of Charles Loew, a silk and embroidery merchant, and his wife, Sarah Ragoler. In 1892 he emigrated with his parents to New York city, where he became a United States citizen in 1900. He was educated at the College of the City of New York (1894&#150;7), Cornell University (1899&#150;1902, BA), the University of Halle (1902&#150;3), and the University of Munich (1903&#150;7, PhD). On 10 February 1911 he married Helen Tracy Porter (a writer and later a translator of Thomas Mann under the name H. T. Lowe-Porter). They had three daughters: Prudence Holcombe (1912&#150;1967), Frances Beatrice 
    (Lady Fawcett; <i>b</i>. 1913)
  , and Patricia Tracy (<i>b</i>. 1917). He changed the spelling of his name to Lowe in 1918.<br>
<br>Lowe's formal teaching of palaeography was all done, with negligible exceptions, at Oxford, where he first lectured in 1913 and was given a regular appointment as lecturer in 1914 and as reader in 1927. As an American and a Jew he represented a rare, if not unique, species at the time of his original appointment. After 1936, when he became one of the first professors at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, to which he would be attached for the rest of his life and where no teaching was required, he continued to lecture at Oxford during Trinity terms, except for the war years, until 1948.<br>
<br>Preceding or concurrently with his Oxford and Princeton careers Lowe was a fellow of the American School of Classical Studies in Rome (1907&#150;8, 1909&#150;11), a research associate in palaeography of the Carnegie Institution of Washington (1911&#150;53), and a consultant in palaeography for the Library of Congress. Corpus Christi College, Oxford, made him an honorary fellow in 1954. The Medieval Academy of America, of which he was a fellow, awarded him its Haskins medal (1957) and the Bibliographical Society gave him its gold medal (1959). He was a corresponding fellow of the British Academy and received similar recognition from academies or institutes in Boston, Dublin, Madrid, Munich, Paris, and Rome. Honorary doctoral degrees were conferred on him by Oxford (1936), North Carolina (1946), and the National University of Ireland (1964).<br>
<br>Lowe always maintained that he became a palaeographer&#151;with the motto he devised, &#145;He is concerned with trifles&#146;&#151;by a series of accidents, the most crucial being his encounter in 1903 with Ludwig Traube, a charismatic professor of medieval Latin philology in Munich who made the study of manuscripts somehow come alive. But he would not have met Traube if he had not gone to study classical philology with Georg Wissowa in Halle in 1902, and he would not have gone to Halle if Charles Bennett, his Latin professor at Cornell, had not incidentally mentioned to him that Halle abounded in &#145;fresh running water&#146;, which to Lowe meant the promise of trout fishing, his favourite form of recreation. Traube's suggested dissertation topic&#151;Monte Cassino as a centre for the transmission of the Latin classics&#151;deflected Lowe from Latin philology to palaeography, since he decided, in order to deal with this topic adequately, that he first needed to study the script used at Monte Cassino, the mother house of Benedictine monasticism. Ironically, he undoubtedly made more contributions to philology indirectly through palaeography than he would have made directly as a philologist.<br>
<br>Lowe's dissertation, <span class="italic">Die &auml;ltesten Kalendarien aus Monte Cassino</span> (1908), and his next major work, <span class="italic">Studia palaeographica: a contribution to the history of early Latin minuscule and to the dating of Visigothic manuscripts</span> (1910), did not deal formally with the script of Monte Cassino. His long investigations into this subject came to fruition only in 1914 with the publication of <span class="italic">The Beneventan Script</span>. This rigorously systematic study of the main script used for the copying of books not only at Monte Cassino but in much of southern Italy from the eighth to the fourteenth century became a landmark in Latin palaeography. It set new standards for treating the history of a script and so overwhelmed the palaeographical world that it had the unintended effect of discouraging further serious research on the Beneventan script for more than a generation. Meant to be published with <span class="italic">The Beneventan Script</span> but delayed until 1929 by the First World War and then by other projects were two folio-size volumes entitled <span class="italic">Scriptura Beneventana</span> and containing facsimiles with transcriptions and descriptions of the main monuments in this script.<br>
<br>Lowe next turned his attention to uncial, a script that had originated probably in the third century, if not the second, and became the most popular medium for the copying of books until well into the eighth century. What particularly excited his interest in this script was the discovery in 1915 of a fragment of the <span class="italic">Letters</span> of Pliny the younger in uncial that was clearly at least several centuries older than any previously known copy of this text. Lowe's attempt to date and localize this fragment more precisely, published as part of <span class="italic">A Sixth-Century Fragment of the &#145;Letters&#146; of Pliny the Younger</span> (1922), forced him to enucleate objective criteria by which uncial manuscripts can be dated and placed. This work of enucleating criteria for dating and placing and of further clarifying the methodological assumptions underlying the interpretation of palaeographical evidence continued in his <span class="italic">Codices Lugdunenses antiquissimi</span> (1924), dealing with the oldest manuscripts in Lyons, and in his <span class="italic">Regula S. Benedicti</span> (1929), a study of the oldest extant manuscript of St Benedict's rule, now preserved in Oxford. During this period he also made his lone attempt at a comprehensive overview of Latin scripts in a chapter on handwriting in <span class="italic">The Legacy of the Middle Ages</span> (1926; an expanded edition, <span class="italic">Handwriting: our Medieval Legacy</span>, was published separately in 1969). This essay forced him to deal with Caroline minuscule, the medieval script to which modern printing is most indebted.<br>
<br>Unquestionably the greatest of Lowe's contributions to palaeography and perhaps unequalled in value by any other palaeographical publication of the twentieth century is his <span class="italic">Codices Latini antiquiores (CLA)</span>. This work is a palaeographical guide in eleven folio-size volumes plus a supplement (1934&#150;71; 2nd edn of vol. 2, 1972) to all the Latin literary manuscripts that survive in scripts antedating the ninth century. It contains detailed descriptions of 1811 manuscripts now preserved in libraries in twenty-one different countries and it provides one or more facsimiles of each manuscript. On the basis of the information in these descriptions Lowe was able to supply each manuscript with an exact or approximate place and date of origin, thus enabling the history of early Latin scripts to be put on a much sounder footing, and he himself began the needed work of synthesis in extensive introductions to several of the volumes. The project, which officially began in 1929 with a substantial grant from the Rockefeller Foundation and the promise of further financial or moral support from numerous other organizations including the Clarendon Press, occupied the remaining forty years of Lowe's life, with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton eventually becoming its main source of funding. In the first volumes he was greatly aided by William J. Anderson and from volume 2 onwards especially by Bernhard Bischoff of the University of Munich. While working on <span class="italic">CLA</span> Lowe managed to publish many other important contributions to palaeography well into his eighties.<br>
<br>Lowe was wide-ranging in both his personal and his literary interests and they added a humanizing dimension to his scholarship. He was a persuasive speaker, a gifted conversationalist, and a genial host, capable of great friendships. Although physically small in stature, there was nothing small about his spirit, which could resolutely both face and overcome adversity. His eyesight so deteriorated from cataracts in his late sixties that he needed others to read for him; after successful surgery he wore glasses with thick lenses. From his mid-sixties onwards he was afflicted with angina pectoris and frequently had to resort to nitroglycerin. With his health so precarious, only an indomitable will to live enabled him to bring <span class="italic">CLA</span> to a successful conclusion. Here he was strengthened by a religious disposition, which convinced him that Providence, and perhaps more particularly the intercessory power of St Benedict, whom he had done his best to honour, would see the project through. He never abandoned his solidarity with the Jewish people, but he did not practise Judaism and in later life told a daughter that if he were to adhere to any religion it would be the Roman Catholic. He died in Bad Nauheim, Germany, on 8 August 1969, shortly after seeing the proof sheets of the last volume of <span class="italic">CLA</span>. His ashes were interred at Corpus Christi College, Oxford.<br>
