<span class="headword">Morton,  Henry Canova Vollam</span>  (1892&#150;1979), <span class="occ">travel writer and journalist</span>, was born on 26 July 1892 at 17 Chester Square, Ashton under Lyne, the son of Joseph Thomas Vollam Morton, newspaper editor, and his wife, Margaret Mary Constance Ewart. Educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, Morton married Dorothy Vaughton (<i>b</i>. 1886/7) on 14 September 1915. The marriage failed, and on 4 January 1934 Morton married Violet Mary Muskett, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Greig (<i>b</i>. 1900/01), herself a divorcee, who was to survive him.<br>
<br>Except for his First World War service in the Warwickshire yeomanry, in which he enlisted as a private in 1914 and rose to the rank of second lieutenant by 1916 and lieutenant in 1918, Morton's entire career was devoted to popular journalism and travel writing. Between 1910 and 1912 he worked for the <span class="italic">Birmingham Gazette and Express</span>, becoming an assistant editor. In 1913 he moved to London, first editing the <span class="italic">Empire Magazine</span> and later working briefly for the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. He returned to London after the war to write for the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>. In 1921 he moved to Lord Beaverbrook's <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, where two years later he gained widespread notice reporting the opening of Tutankhamen's tomb.<br>
<br>H. V. Morton, as he styled himself, emerged in the 1920s as one of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>'s most successful columnists. The pivotal moment in his career came in April 1926 when he began to write the series of articles which would be published the following year as <span class="italic">In Search of England</span>. The book was an immediate success, as it engagingly interwove human interest accounts of a journey around a pastoral England with potted historical and literary vignettes and pronouncements on national identity. Once the approach was set, Morton followed up with similarly titled books on Scotland (1929), Ireland (1930), Wales (1932), South Africa (1948), and London (1951). A prolific writer, who also published accounts of his travels in the Holy Land, Spain, and Italy, and fifteen other works on the British Isles, he had by 1964 sold 2.9 million books, establishing his position as the most popular British travel writer of the twentieth century. Morton was keenly aware of his readers, particularly those in the lower-middle class, insisting that the price of his guides be kept low in order that they might appeal to, and at the same time educate, a large audience in what was the first age of mass democracy in Britain.<br>
<br>Three interrelated themes informed Morton's writings. The first was the claim that the strength of a nation was ultimately determined by the condition of its villages and small towns. Reflecting the ideals of the late Victorian arts and crafts movement and drawing upon the deep love of the countryside he had developed as a youth bicycling through Warwickshire lanes, Morton insisted that only the rural world offered a setting where the occupations, pre-eminently agriculture, which were essential to the physical and emotional well-being, indeed the very survival, of the British people could thrive. The second was the insistence that the industrial and urban revolutions had inflicted fundamental damage on the nation, particularly the rural yeomanry, now subject to ever-increasing foreign competition, and its urban counterparts, the upper-working class and the lower-middle class. Morton developed this line of argument through grim portrayals of city life as well as more humorous accounts of bourgeois American tourists who had achieved material success but who lacked any appreciation of their cultural heritage. The third theme was the hope that through a recognition of the central continuities of British history and national character renewal might be achieved. To Morton the most important element shaping this continuity was Christianity, and it is revealing that he chose to conclude <span class="italic">In Search of England</span> in a vicar's garden, uniting the pastoral and the spiritual. This approach also carried over into Morton's travel writing on areas other than the United Kingdom, in which he focused only on places and countries, from the Holy Land to Ireland, where faith and life were inextricably linked.<br>
<br>Morton believed that these themes were national in appeal and scope, transcending the narrow confines of any one political party. He espoused them while writing for the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, and equally he espoused them after being lured to its left-wing rival the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>, for which he worked as a special writer between 1931 and 1942. Morton almost welcomed the coming of the Second World War, as he thought it might rescue Britain from the false ideas and malaise which had dominated since the early nineteenth century and reunite the country in a life-and-death struggle to protect its historical and ecological heritage. While Morton did recognize that success in a modern war depended on technology and precision engineering, his wartime writing, which included an account of the 1941 Churchill&#150;Roosevelt meeting which led to the Atlantic charter and a propagandistic novel of what life would be like under a Nazi occupation, emphasized the &#145;chivalry&#146; of the Royal Air Force and characterized Churchill as an emotional Elizabethan who rose above class to lead a national crusade.<br>
<br>Despite the wide acclaim and wealth which his works had brought Morton, after the Labour Party's 1945 victory he became disenchanted with life in a Britain whose leaders, he argued, were pandering to an increasingly powerful working class and promoting Marxist ideology and state planning over Christian values. To escape these contagions, Morton decided in 1947 to move his family to South Africa, where he believed conditions were not unlike those in England in the 1920s. Morton became a South African citizen, and life at Somerset West, where he settled, brought a measure of contentment. He contemplated writing a memoir to be entitled &#145;Fair generally&#146;, but he abandoned the idea. The last years of Morton's life were increasingly darkened by fears sparked by the decline of British power and the growth of black nationalism, and doubts about the ability of Western governments to survive in a time of crisis that Morton believed was similar to the French Revolutionary era. Morton died on 17/18 June 1979 in South Africa.<br>
