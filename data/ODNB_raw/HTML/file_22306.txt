<span class="headword">Pinto <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Saunders or Sanders]</span>,  George Frederick</span>  (1785&#150;1806), <span class="occ">composer, violinist, and pianist</span>, born in Lambeth, London, on 25 September 1785, was the son of Samuel Saunders (or Sanders) and his wife, Julia, a singer, who was the daughter of the violinist and composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22307/', "Thomas Pinto")</script>. Throughout his brief career as a musician George Frederick always used his mother's maiden name as his surname. He showed very early promise as a violinist and about 1794 was sent to study with Johann Peter Salomon. At the age of ten he made his first public appearance as a violinist, playing a concerto at Signora Salvini's benefit concert on 4 May 1796. For the next few years he appeared regularly in concerts in London and in other British towns and cities, and he seems to have made two excursions to Paris. At Salomon's benefit concert on 10 March 1800 he played the violin in a sonata for piano and violin with John Field. Pinto's op. 1, a set of three divertimenti for piano, was advertised in the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> on 5 November 1801, but no copies of this publication are currently known to exist. His op. 2, <span class="italic">Three Favourite Airs with Variations</span>, also for piano, probably appeared in 1802.<br>
<br>It is not known with whom Pinto learned piano, but the composer and writer Alexander Campbell referred in 1802 to his musical activities in Edinburgh, where his grandfather Thomas Pinto was a leading resident musician. Campbell stated:<blockquote>Young Pinto is not only an admirable violin player, but also a first-rate performer on the grand piano forte; to excell on two instruments so widely different from each other, is a proof of genius and unwearied application very seldom to be met with. (Campbell, 189)</blockquote>In fact the piano seems to have become Pinto's favoured instrument at about this time, as his early publications of piano music suggest. The airs with variations were followed in 1803 by two grand sonatas in E[flat] minor and A major, op. 3, and a grand sonata in C minor, published without opus number. Three sonatas, in G major, B[flat] major, and C major, op. 4, were issued in 1804 or 1805. Other posthumously published works may also date from this period, including a fantasia and sonata for piano in C minor (left in an unfinished state by Pinto but completed by Samuel Wesley and Joseph Woelfl), and a sonata for piano with violin accompaniment in A major, edited by Woelfl. At Domenico Corri's Edinburgh concerts in January 1803, when Corri was prevented by an accident from appearing, the seventeen-year-old Pinto &#145;presided at the pianoforte&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Grove</span>).<br>
<br>In 1804 Pinto began to suffer serious ill health, but it seems he still carried on composing. Three duets for two violins were published as op. 5 in 1805, and another three appeared soon afterwards, probably in the same year. At about the same time he also published <span class="italic">Cory Owen, a Favourite Irish Air, Arranged as a Rondo</span> for piano. The last works to be seen into print by Pinto himself were three sonatas for piano with violin accompaniment, which appeared in 1806; the title is somewhat misleading, for, in contrast with the majority of such sonatas in that period, the violin in all Pinto's sonatas was not subordinate to the piano, both instruments playing a full part in the presentation and elaboration of the musical material. Towards the end of his short life Pinto also published a number of songs, to which he or the publisher gave the fashionable title &#145;canzonets&#146;, and others were published soon after his death. These show his remarkable command of the expressive techniques of the day; Nicholas Temperley has remarked, &#145;Only Schubert himself wrote more striking songs before the age of 20&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Grove</span>). By November 1805, when he was engaged for a series of concerts in Oxford, Pinto's condition had deteriorated to such an extent that he was able to take part only in one of them. This was his last public performance. He died in Chelsea on 22 March 1806. The cause of death is not known, though his biographer in Grove's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span> asserted that his health had been &#145;undermined by excesses&#146;. He was buried at St Margaret's, Westminster.<br>
