<span class="headword">Hall family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1650&#150;<em>c.</em>1750), <span class="occ">ironmasters</span>, became involved in the iron trade with the marriage, late in the 1640s, of <a name="cosubject_56137"></a><span class="headword">Michael Hall</span>  (1623/4&#150;<em>c.</em>1670)<span class="occ"></span>, a younger son of Richard Hall of Greet, Shropshire. Michael had been educated at Christ Church, Oxford, from where he matriculated aged seventeen in 1641; his wife was <a name="cosubject_56138"></a><span class="headword">Elizabeth Hall <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cotton]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1679)<span class="occ"></span>, sister of the ironmaster <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49046/', "William Cotton (d. 1675)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49045/', "Cotton family")</script>]. They had nine children. In 1662 Cotton became partner of the Myddelton family of Chirk Castle in their Denbighshire ironworks and by 1663 Michael Hall was living at Ruabon, where the partnership's blast furnace was situated. He died about 1670, being succeeded as clerk in the ironworks by his eldest son, a second Michael Hall (1654&#150;1684). Elizabeth Hall subsequently had the oversight of the furnace for which, in addition to &#145;riding charges&#146; incurred for sales of iron and purchase of charcoal, she was paid &pound;30 a year until her death in 1679.<br>
<br>A younger son, <a name="cosubject_49040"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Hall</span>  (1657&#150;1715)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born at Tenbury, Worcestershire, on 26 March 1657, operated the furnace at Madeley, Staffordshire, from 1683, probably in conjunction with Norton and Winnington forges. By 1687 he was a partner in the Cheshire ironworks with his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49047/', "William Cotton (1648/9&#150;1703)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49045/', "Cotton family")</script>]. During the 1690s he managed this partnership (Lawton furnace, Warmingham and Cranage forges, Cranage slitting mill, and Street plating forge), which from 1696 onwards was closely linked with the Staffordshire works (Mear Heath furnace, Consall, Tib Green, Oakamoor, Chartley, Abbots Bromley, and Cannock forges, with Consall and Rugeley slitting mills), a Foley and Wheeler concern. Hall further cemented his family's industrial links by his marriage in 1697 to Cotton's sister, Joanna (<i>d</i>. 1721), though this union left no surviving children.<br>
<br>Hall built a new Cheshire furnace in 1696 at Vale Royal. It smelted haematite ores brought by sea from Furness, so most of its product was tough pig iron. Some of this went to a forge which Hall built in 1699 at Bodfari to supply north Wales. Vale Royal, Lawton, and Mear Heath were three of the largest furnaces of the period, and because the Cheshire partnership now had two large furnaces, it was able to make good the Staffordshire deficit of pig iron with either tough pig from Vale Royal or cold-short pig smelted from local ores at Lawton. This made the amalgamation of the two partnerships in 1707 a logical step. In the Staffordshire works Hall owned a seventh share, and after the death of John Wheeler he also acted as managing director for a short time. But his responsibilities covered a wide area; in Yorkshire after the death of William [ii] Cotton he witnessed a wood agreement of 1704 and the new lease of Colne Bridge forge in 1706, on behalf of Anna Cotton (<i>d</i>. 1721), his sister-in-law. Thomas Hall died at The Hermitage, Cranage, on 25 March 1715.<br>
<br>Thomas's younger brother <a name="cosubject_49041"></a><span class="headword">Edward Hall</span>  (1664&#150;1750)<span class="occ"></span> of Cranage was born at Ruabon, Denbighshire, on 14 April 1664. He was briefly a scholar at Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1684, and he is known to have delivered iron for the use of Sir Thomas Myddelton in 1685. In 1701 he married Anne Frances Maurice (<i>d</i>. 1758) in Chester; they had three sons and three daughters. By 1700 his investment of &pound;10,251 made him the largest shareholder in the Cheshire works. Hall's responsibility was Warmingham forge, though in 1706 he transferred to Vale Royal furnace and Bodfari forge. After the amalgamation of the partnerships he had a sixth share in the Cheshire works and a seventh in those of Staffordshire, and he gradually succeeded to the dominating role played by his brother. Already in 1711, along with his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56297/', "Daniel Cotton (c.1660&#150;1723)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49045/', "Cotton family")</script>], he had established a furnace at Cunsey in Furness, though the company continued to smelt haematite ores in Cheshire, until 1718 at Vale Royal and then at a new furnace built at Oulton in 1719. In 1720 Hall acquired a share in the new Bretton furnace&#150;Kilnhurst forge partnership of his Yorkshire nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49049/', "William Westby Cotton (bap. 1689, d. 1749)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49045/', "Cotton family")</script>]. The same year he built a furnace at Carr Mill, near St Helens, on a thirty-year lease from a Roman Catholic co-religionist, Sir William Gerard of Garswood. This furnace presumably worked in conjunction with Aintree forge, which Hall held in 1727. In Furness he had the Cheshire company's second furnace built at Duddon Bridge in 1736.<br>
<br>Edward Hall cannot have been a Roman Catholic when at Brasenose College, but was described as such when his estates were duly registered in 1723. The ironmasters Thomas Hall and William Hall, who presented silver communion patens to Bodfari and Lawton churches respectively in 1699, were presumably his elder brothers Thomas and William (1659&#150;1700). William resided at Ruthin from 1679 to 1685 and died at Mostyn. In 1708 Thomas presented a double-tiered brass candelabrum to the church at Holmes Chapel, and there he also endowed schools. &#145;The present Ironmasters of Lawton Furnace&#146; donated a peal of bells to the church at Lawton in 1713. There is, however, no record of similar gifts by Edward Hall himself, who died on 23 September 1750.<br>
<br>Edward's eldest son was <a name="cosubject_49043"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Hall</span>  (1702&#150;1748)<span class="occ"></span> of The Hermitage, Cranage, who was born on 3 June 1702 at Warmingham forge. He possibly attended Peterhouse, Cambridge. He married Elizabeth Bayley (<i>d</i>. 1745) of Nantwich in 1738, and they had a son and a daughter. Thomas's will mentions his interest in Bodfari forge; from there he had supplied iron to Ruthin church in 1720. Receipts of iron at the Stour valley forges during the 1730s demonstrate Thomas Hall's involvement at Sowley furnace in Hampshire, and in 1729 in connection with this he, along with Myles Troughton of Beaulieu, took a sixteen-year lease of Viscount Montagu's mines at Lindal and Dalton in Furness. Thomas Hall served as mayor of Chester during the Jacobite rising of 1745, and was apparently of the established church. He died at The Hermitage, Cranage, on 27 June 1748. Edward Hall's youngest son, Maurice (1715&#150;1741), was involved in wood-procurement in south Lancashire in 1741, but also predeceased his father. The second son and executor, Richard Edward Hall (1703&#150;1793), was a Manchester surgeon, so managerial interest in the iron industry passed out of the family.<br>
<br>After the building of the Vale Royal furnace by Thomas Hall in 1696, the Hall family was of major importance for the development of the iron industry in north-west England. The decision of the Cheshire partnership to establish its own mines, furnace, and forge in Furness provoked local ironmasters into forming the Backbarrow company, and suddenly opened up the whole area to the blast furnace. The effective failure of the male line in the Hall family, however, coincided with the major technological and organizational changes within the iron industry which attended the transition from charcoal to coke smelting. Like their cousins and sometime partners, the Cottons, the Halls withdrew from the iron trade after a century of involvement. Their forge at Cranage and the furnaces at Cunsey, Carr Mill, and Lawton are all thought to have been discontinued about 1750.<br>
<br>The Hall family together with the associated kindred families of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49045/', "Cotton")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47500/', "Kendall")</script>, played a pioneering role in the growth of the iron industry in Britain between the mid-seventeenth and the mid-eighteenth centuries. Members of the family were active in wide-ranging business partnerships which were the leading producers of iron in Staffordshire, Cheshire, and the north-west of England.<br>
