<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Parsons,  Geoffrey Penwill</span>  (1929&#150;1995), <span class="occ">pianist and accompanist</span>, was born on 15 June 1929 in Sydney, Australia, one of three sons of Francis Hedley Parsons and his wife, Edith Vera Buckland. He was educated at Canterbury high school, Sydney, and continued to the State Conservatorium of Music there as a pupil of Winifred Burston. His career as a pianist was launched when he won the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's concerto competition in 1947, which led to his first concert tour of Australia the following year (and, he later noted, his thirtieth tour there in 1993). While at the conservatorium he was encouraged by Vern Bartlett, a family friend who was also the leading accompanist in Sydney at that time, to give serious thought to making his own career in this role.<br>
<br>Some trial recitals in this capacity with local singers suggested that Parsons should work further in this direction and brought him to the attention of Peter Dawson (1882&#150;1961), a popular bass-baritone ballad singer, with whom he toured Australia and New Zealand in 1949. Dawson was due to make another of his tours of Britain, taking in Canada <i>en route</i>, and invited Parsons to join him. The Canadian dates fell through, but Parsons spent his last &pound;60 on a passage to England in the hope of joining up with Dawson again. He arrived in England in 1950, and remained in the country for the rest of his life, first facing a personal crisis of no work or prospects when his dates with Dawson were restricted to six. Knowing, through Dawson, only some contacts working in the variety theatres, Parsons turned to them in the hope of obtaining work. &#145;I kept going along to the piers and being accompanist for mouth organs, bones I remember I played for, a piano accordion, jew's harp; I really did play for the lot&#146;, he later recalled  (Askonas, 17). In addition he found some concert work rather in the shadow of Gerald Moore, then the first-choice accompanist for leading international singers. In 1955 it transpired that Moore could not be available to appear with the prominent German lieder singer Gerhard H&uuml;sch on the latter's first return to Britain since the end of the Second World War. Parsons was approached to replace Moore, and the event was so successful that H&uuml;sch engaged him again the following year and thereafter invited him to become his permanent accompanist.<br>
<br>Although H&uuml;sch was then nearing the end of his performing career, Parsons seized the chance to visit him in Munich for serious daily work on the lieder repertory. &#145;We worked virtually all day&#146;, said Parsons: &#145;the best possible school for me that I could have had. My interest in Lieder was good before that, but it became all-absorbing&#146;  (Askonas, 17). Word soon spread that Parsons had exceptional accomplishment as a gifted partner for a singer, bringing him an invitation from the recording executive Walter Legge to accompany his wife, the celebrated soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, at London's Royal Festival Hall in 1961. They worked through seven three-hour rehearsals in preparation for the concert, and thereafter Parsons was in the forefront of his specialized profession.<br>
<br>His investment of time and patience in meticulous preparation was a major component of Parsons's success in working with Schwarzkopf and other famous singers from many countries. Following the opening of London's new Barbican Hall in March 1982 he was invited to put together his own series of song recitals, no doubt to demonstrate the hall's suitability for small-scale events as well as orchestral concerts. In October of that year &#145;Geoffrey Parsons and friends&#146; presented, within a single month, memorable themed programmes by individual singers, the &#145;friends&#146; including Victoria de los Angeles, Dame Janet Baker, Nicolai Gedda, Felicity Lott, and Margaret Price, to whom were added on other occasions Elisabeth Harwood, Hans Hotter, Sena Jurinac, and Jessye Norman, to name but a few. Parsons wrote a programme article for his Barbican series, &#145;The art of the accompanist&#146;, wherein he defined his artistic ideal as &#145;producing a cushion of basically rich sound, on which the singer feels supported and borne along in utter safety&#146;  (Barbican Hall, 12 Oct 1982). He added, in the same article, &#145;We are expected to know all the &#147;standard&#148; songs, and most of the unusual ones, in keys not only high, low and medium, but also appropriately higher, lower or more medium, printed or not&#146;. Parsons did not confine his attentions to singers, but worked also with violinists such as Ida Haendel, Nathan Milstein, and Wanda Wilkomirska, and with the cellist Paul Tortelier. It was all part of what he called &#145;a life of unceasing and stimulating challenge&#146;  (ibid.), in which he invariably combined courtesy and regard for the artist he was accompanying with a justified sense of his own worth. Roger Vignoles, a fellow accompanist and occasional duet and two-piano partner, declared that the only word to do justice to Parsons in performance was &#145;immaculate&#146; in relation to &#145;the seamless fluency of his playing&#146;  (Vignoles).<br>
<br>Vignoles also testified to Parsons's &#145;unfailing generosity&#146;, not least to &#145;the dozens of younger musicians who came to his London home in West Hampstead&#146;, where &#145;he was an excellent and famously hospitable cook&#146;  (Vignoles). He enjoyed good food, fine wines, books, and paintings, liked to visit the theatre and always enjoyed opera, leaving an enduring memory of his playing for rehearsals of <span class="italic">Der Rosenkavalier</span> at Glyndebourne one summer, just because he loved the work so much. He would converse as affably with an off-duty critic as he did with his own circle, which included his long-time domestic partner, the singer and voice teacher Erich Vietheer (who predeceased him in 1989). He was a committed Anglican, a benefactor of both St Albans Abbey and St Cyprian's, Clarence Gate, where he worshipped regularly and endowed a stained-glass window. He accumulated honours from London music colleges, was appointed OBE in 1977, and received the Order of Australia in 1990. His death from cancer on 26 January 1995, in the Middlesex Hospital, London, followed mercifully soon after the onset of the disease.<br>
