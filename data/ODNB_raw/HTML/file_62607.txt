<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clarke,  Edwin Sisterson</span>  (1919&#150;1996), <span class="occ">medical historian and neurologist</span>, was born on 18 June 1919 at Mona House, Crow Hall Lane, Felling-on-Tyne, co. Durham, son of Joseph Henry Clarke, painter and decorator, and Nellie, daughter of Robert Sisterson, a shopkeeper. Brought up in poverty by his mother, he left Jarrow central school at fourteen. During a subsequent apprenticeship (1935&#150;8) in pharmacy at the dispensary of Newcastle General Hospital, his relatives were so impressed with his ambitions and abilities that they paid for him to attend medical school at the University of Durham, which he entered in 1939.<br>
<br>During the Second World War the Rockefeller Foundation funded a programme whereby a few selected British medical students could expedite their clinical training in the United States. Clarke studied at the University of Chicago from 1943 to 1945 and returned to take his MB BS degrees from Durham in 1945. He graduated MD at Chicago in 1946, and MD at Durham in 1954. He undertook postgraduate neurological and neurosurgical training with Sir Hugh Cairns at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, spent two years (1946&#150;8) as a graded neurological specialist in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and continued his postgraduate studies at the Radcliffe Infirmary (1948&#150;9) and the National Hospital, Queen Square, London (1950&#150;51). From 1951 to 1958 he worked at the department of medicine at the Postgraduate Medical School of London in Hammersmith, where he became a consultant and lecturer in neurology. A steady stream of papers in prestigious journals on many aspects of neurological diagnosis, therapeutics, and pathology reflected his high intelligence, capacity for sustained work, and ambition.<br>
<br>Sir John McMichael, chairman in the department of medicine at Hammersmith, encouraged Clarke to move to the Wellcome Trust in 1958 as assistant scientific secretary. During these two years Clarke broadened his interests and determined on a new career in the history of medicine. He spent three years studying and teaching the subject in the United States, at Johns Hopkins and Yale universities. He also spent a brief period at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he began a collaboration with C. D. O'Malley that was to result in <span class="italic">The Human Brain and Spinal Cord</span> (1968; 2nd edn, 1996), a substantial collection of primary texts edited, introduced, and translated by Clarke and O'Malley. It was much more than a simple anthology, rather a major bio-bibliographical reference tool within neuroscience.<br>
<br>Clarke returned to Britain in 1963 as a medical historian in the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum and Library. He and the librarian, F. N. L. Poynter, were not compatible, and when Poynter became director of a newly organized Wellcome Institute in 1964 there were tensions between the two men. A solution was reached in 1966, when the Wellcome Trust created a sub-department of the history of medicine within the department of anatomy at University College, London (UCL), with Clarke as senior lecturer and head. Promoted to a readership within the University of London in 1972, Clarke introduced courses in medical history to medical students at UCL and the Royal Free Hospital medical school, trained several postgraduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and worked energetically to create medical history as an academic discipline.<br>
<br>In 1973 Clarke succeeded Poynter as director of the Wellcome Institute, where he presided over the removal of the museum artefacts to the Science Museum, in South Kensington, and the creation of an academic unit with formal ties with University College. Despite his commitment to academic status for his discipline, he was never entirely comfortable with many of the younger recruits to the field, who brought anthropological, sociological, or social history perspectives to bear on the subject. Clarke continued to work prodigiously hard, edited the quarterly journal <span class="italic">Medical History</span>, and pursued his own scholarship in the history of the neurosciences. However, he no longer enjoyed teaching or the public aspects of directing a highly visible institute. Consequently he retired at the end of 1979 and spent the next few years creating a library and small museum in the neurosciences at the Sherrington Centre, University of Oxford. The nucleus of the library was one of several personal collections that this ardent bibliophile assembled.<br>
<br>Clarke was married three times; the first marriage, on 15 December 1949 to Margaret Elsie Morrison (<i>b</i>. 1921/2), brought them two sons. After it was dissolved he married on 5 December 1958 Beryl Eileen Brock (<i>b</i>. 1924/5), with whom he had a daughter. This union was also dissolved, and on 18 March 1982 he was married a third time&#151;to Gaynor Crawford (<i>b</i>. 1947/8), a journalist, who survived him.<br>
<br>Clarke was a stickler for factual and bibliographical accuracy, and his own scholarship reflected this. His original contributions built almost exclusively on his professional knowledge of neurology and related fields. Much of it was collaborative. With the psychiatrist-historian Kenneth Dewhurst he wrote <span class="italic">An Illustrated History of Brain Function</span> (1972; 2nd edn, 1996), and with the historian L. S. Jacyna he published <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century Origins of Neuroscientific Concepts</span> (1987). He also produced, in 1981, an updated translation of Max Neuburger's classic, <span class="italic">Historical Development of Experimental Brain and Spinal Cord Physiology before Flourens</span> (1897). He was working on a history of medical history in Britain when he died on 11 April 1996 at his home, the Old Rectory, Donington-on-Bain, Louth, Lincolnshire, of cancer.<br>
