<span class="headword">Couvreur <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Huybers; <em>other married name </em>Fraser]</span>,  Jessie Catherine</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Tasma]</span>  (1848&#150;1897), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born on 28 October 1848 at Southwood Lodge, Highgate, Middlesex, the second child and eldest daughter in a family of five sons and three daughters. Her mother, Charlotte Sophia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ogleby (1817&#150;1908), who had run a small boarding-school in England, placed great store on genealogy, emphasizing throughout her life the status derived from having a French mother, and connections with a titled family through her English father. Jessie's father, (James) Alfred Huybers (1811&#150;1893), came from Flemish merchant stock, and it was his decision to set up as a wine trader in the Australian colonies that took the family in 1852 to Hobart in Van Diemen's Land&#151;soon to be renamed Tasmania. When she embarked on her career as an author, Jessie's choice of Tasma as pen-name declared her pride in the formative influence of the place. She helped educate her younger brothers and sisters and, in addition to the love of languages and intellectual debate derived from her increasingly eccentric mother, developed also a passion for outdoor pursuits, notably sea-bathing and horse-riding.<br>
<br>However, following her early marriage to Charles Forbes Fraser (1841&#150;1913), in Hobart on 6 June 1867, Jessie spent only short periods in Tasmania. Charles Fraser was employed on rural properties owned by his well-connected family in the Australian mainland state of Victoria, among which the couple moved until incompatibilities between Charles's sporting interests and Jessie's cultural ones, compounded by financial problems, brought about their separation in December 1872. In March 1873 Jessie set sail with her mother and siblings for London via Cape Horn, to spend over two years in Brussels and Paris. On her return to Melbourne in 1875 she was reunited with Charles, and in 1877 she began to publish articles and stories, mainly in the Melbourne newspaper <span class="italic">The Australasian</span>, where her work appeared regularly to the late 1880s.<br>
<br>The Fraser marriage broke down finally in 1878. In 1879 Jessie was back in Europe, where she joined her mother and four siblings in Paris. Here, as Madame Jessie Tasma, she embarked on a career as lecturer on Australian subjects, praised for the quality of her French as well as her beauty and animation, and recognized in the mid-1880s by the award of the French honour <i>Officier d'Acad&eacute;mie</i> (rarely accorded to foreigners and even more rarely to women), for services to cultural education.<br>
<br>It was while Jessie was in Venice to lecture in 1881 that she met the distinguished Belgian liberal politician and journalist Auguste Pierre Louis Couvreur (1827&#150;1894), recently widowed. They married in London on 7 August 1885 and took up residence in Brussels, Jessie having secured a divorce during her last visit to Australia in 1883&#150;4. She now began to write longer fictional works which both reworked her life experiences, especially in the Fraser marriage, and also celebrated the energy and opportunities of Australia while respecting the cultural values of the Old World. She had significant success with <span class="italic">Uncle Piper of Piper's Hill</span>, serialized in <span class="italic">The Australasian</span> in 1888 and published in book form in London in 1889. This mellow comedy, set in the booming city of Melbourne in the 1860s, dwells on the egalitarian possibilities of life in Australia by its depiction of the family of Tom Piper, who has migrated from England in the gold rushes and made money as a butcher and in real estate. This novel was rapidly followed by a volume of stories, <span class="italic">A Sydney Sovereign</span> (1890), and five more novels, none of them acclaimed as <span class="italic">Uncle Piper</span> had been. Writing for her living, Jessie produced also a translation into French, and journalism in both French and English, publishing frequently in Edmund Yates's London newspaper, <span class="italic">The World</span>.<br>
<br>In 1892 Auguste Couvreur was appointed Brussels correspondent for <span class="italic">The Times</span>. When he died on 23 April 1894, Jessie indefatigably took over the role until her own death from coronary heart disease at her home, 161 chauss&eacute;e de Vleurgat, Brussels, on 23 October 1897. In accordance with her long-held principles she was cremated, though this required that her body travel by rail to Paris (where she was cremated at P&egrave;re Lachaise) as cremation was illegal in Belgium. Her mother and five siblings&#151;for whom she had had significant financial responsibility&#151;survived her. Obituaries identified her prominence in the London literary scene, and her distinctive role as a cultural ambassador for Australia.<br>
