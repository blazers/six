<span class="headword">Ottley,  Adam</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1655, <em>d.</em> 1723), <span class="occ">bishop of St David's</span>, was baptized at Pitchford, Shropshire, on 5 January 1655, the second surviving son of Sir Richard Ottley (1626&#150;1670) of Pitchford, gentleman of the privy chamber to Charles II, and his wife, Lady Lettice, daughter of Robert Ridgeway, second earl of Londonderry. The Ottleys had been staunchly royalist in the civil war; the bishop's grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20940/', "Sir Francis Ottley (1600/01&#150;1649)")</script> was Charles I's governor of Shrewsbury. Adam Ottley matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1672, was made a scholar in 1674, and took his BA in 1676 and MA in 1679. He then migrated to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he was a fellow from 1680 to 1684, and was admitted DD in 1691. He served as rector of Prestbury, Shropshire, from 1682, as a prebendary of Hereford from 1686, and as archdeacon of Shropshire from 1687. He married Ann Baldwyn (<i>bap</i>. 1660?, <i>d</i>. 1720) at Stokesay church on 24 January 1688; she was probably the daughter of Sir Samuel Baldwyn, of Elsedge, serjeant-at-law, and thus sister of Elizabeth Baldwyn who married Ottley's elder brother Thomas and of Charles Baldwyn, whig MP for Ludlow in the 1681, 1685, and 1691 parliaments. The marriage seems to have been childless. She was buried at Pitchford on 14 April 1720.<br>
<br>Ottley appears to have had tory sympathies and emerged as a candidate for promotion under the ministry of Robert Harley, earl of Oxford. His nephews Acton Baldwyn, who had succeeded to the family seat in the Commons at Ludlow, and the younger Adam Ottley (1685&#150;1752) both had tory inclinations. When the see of Hereford fell vacant some in the diocese canvassed for Ottley to become bishop, but instead, following the translation of Philip Bisse to the see of Hereford, Ottley was nominated on 11 December 1712 to succeed him as bishop of St David's. The younger Adam Ottley enthusiastically reported that &#145;the whole ministry&#146;  (Evans, 119) struggled for Ottley's appointment, but he particularly indicated the support of &#145;Mr Brydges&#146;&#151;probably the whig paymaster-general, James Brydges, later first duke of Chandos. Elected on 28 February 1713, Ottley was confirmed at Bow church on 14 March, consecrated at Lambeth on the following day, and enthroned at St David's Cathedral on 29 July. Although his penultimate predecessor, Philip Bull (1705&#150;10), had been an effective reforming force the see of St David's had suffered from a long series of indifferent, often non-resident bishops, who (like Bisse) had used it merely as a stepping stone to greater things. From the beginning Ottley was determined to be an exception. He restored the episcopal palace at Abergwili, in Carmarthenshire, which had become uninhabitable, and did much to create the building that survived a devastating fire in 1903 and now houses the Carmarthenshire county museum. Ottley undertook three visitations of the diocese (in 1714, 1717, and 1723) and attempted to advance the careers of native Welsh clergymen. He was rigorous in enforcing clerical residence and in attempting to improve the quality of his diocesan clergy; he also tried to stamp out the itinerant preaching of the most popular of his clergy, Griffith Jones, rector of Llanddowror, whom he condemned for &#145;intruding himself into the churches of other ministers without their leave&#146;  (Jenkins, 14). His attempt to confine Jones, whose activities anticipated the growth of Welsh Methodism, within parochial boundaries was unsuccessful. Ottley was also recognized as a patron of Welsh literature; he was the dedicatee of Theophilus Evans's <span class="italic">Drych y prif oesoedd</span> in 1716 and subscribed to Evans's translations of English-language religious works into Welsh in 1719 and 1722. In 1724 he wrote to the SPCK, suggesting that they publish an English translation of Rhys Prichard's <span class="italic">Canwyll y Cymry</span>, but the scheme fell through.<br>
<br>Ottley fell ill on 23 September 1723 with &#145;a pain at my stomach, heart burning and an inclination to vomiting&#146;  (Evans, 128). He died at the episcopal palace, Abergwili, on 4 October and was buried at Abergwili&#151;a choice that was extremely unusual for post-Reformation bishops of St David's and a fitting final proof of his commitment to his diocese. His library and collection of curiosities was auctioned at Paul's Coffee House, London, on 19 April 1725. His nephew Adam was the chief beneficiary of his will, dated 5 September 1723, in which he passed on the estate that he had inherited in 1688 from his uncle and godfather Sir Adam Ottley, master of the chancery court. The nephew, registrar of St David's from 1713, was the writer of most of the materials in the Ottley papers, a substantial collection eventually deposited at the National Library of Wales. Generally regarded as one of the most effective eighteenth-century bishops in Wales, and one of the few bishops of St David's regularly resident and genuinely committed to his diocese, Ottley was even eulogized in verse:<blockquote>
<div>O thou who dost the sacred mitre grace,<br>
</div>
<div>Thou the good star that rul'st St David's place &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>Thee Ottley with new vigour wee behold<br>
</div>
<div>Enlivening statutes to their force of old,<br>
</div>
<div>A Palace which some thought no crime t'impair,<br>
</div>
<div>We see rebuilding by thy better care.<br>
</div> (Evans, 130)</blockquote>
