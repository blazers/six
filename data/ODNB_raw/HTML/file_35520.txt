<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Phipps, Sir  Eric Clare Edmund</span>  (1875&#150;1945), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born in Madrid on 27 October 1875, the only child of Sir (Edmund) Constantine Henry Phipps (1840&#150;1911), diplomatist, later HM minister in Brussels (1900&#150;1906), and his first wife, Maria Jane (<i>d</i>. 1902), eldest daughter of Alfred Miller Mundy, of Shipley Hall, Derbyshire. He came from a family which had distinguished itself through service to the British crown during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, particularly in the navy, diplomacy, and the colonies. His great-grandfather, Henry Phipps, first earl of Mulgrave, had served as foreign secretary in 1805&#150;6, and his great-uncle, Constantine Henry Phipps, first marquess of Normanby, had been lord lieutenant of Ireland and ambassador in Paris. Phipps accompanied his parents to their various diplomatic posts and was privately educated in Dresden, Vienna, and Paris. He studied for a year at King's College, Cambridge, and subsequently graduated <i>bachelier-&egrave;s-lettres</i> at the University of Paris. He was twice married, first on 20 July in 1907 to Yvonne (<i>d</i>. 1909), youngest daughter of the Comte de Louvencourt, of Paris, and second on 29 April 1911 to Frances Georgina (<i>d</i>. 1988), second daughter of Herbert Ward, a British sculptor who had settled in France. Although there were no children of the first marriage, by the second there were two daughters and four sons, one of whom was killed in action at Leros in November 1942.<br>
<br>In view of his upbringing and family background it was natural that Phipps should consider a career in the diplomatic service for which he was nominated as attach&eacute; in October 1898 and which he entered after passing the competitive examination in January 1899. He served in Paris from October 1899 to December 1904 (being promoted third secretary in January 1901), and in Constantinople from January to September 1905 (being promoted second secretary in April that year). After a short spell in the Foreign Office he was transferred to Rome in September 1906. In February 1909 he was appointed private secretary to the British ambassador in Paris, Sir Francis Bertie. In April 1912 he secured promotion to first secretary and thereafter served in St Petersburg until October 1913, when he was transferred to Madrid before returning to Paris in May 1916. Following the armistice he was attached to the British delegation at the Paris peace conference until September 1919 when he was promoted counsellor and assigned to the Foreign Office in London. Appointed CMG in January 1920, he was transferred in November that year to the British embassy in Brussels, where he served for two years as charg&eacute; d'affaires. He was made a CVO in May 1922. In November 1922 he was appointed minister-plenipotentiary and transferred again to Paris, where he spent the next six years, frequently acting as charg&eacute; d'affaires. He was made a KCMG in June 1927. In June 1928 he received his first independent post as envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary in Vienna, in which capacity he was attached to the British delegation at the Hague reparations conferences of August 1929 and January 1930.<br>
<br>His experience in Vienna of National Socialist agitation and subversion served Phipps well for his appointment as HM ambassador in Berlin, where he replaced Sir Horace Rumbold in August 1933 (a week after being sworn of the privy council). The next four years provided him with an excellent opportunity to observe Hitler and his movement, and to evaluate their significance for Germany and the wider world. In common with many of his contemporaries he initially hoped that Hitler might be persuaded to sign an armaments agreement and to pursue other avenues of multilateral negotiation with the new regime. Shortly after taking up his post, however, he became intensely suspicious of the aims of national socialism, to which his subsequent voluminous correspondence with the Foreign Office bears ample testimony. Elegant and humorous, yet at the same time teeming with insight and penetration, Phipps's reporting has a quality that sets him aside from his contemporaries in the British diplomatic service. Stanley Baldwin later reflected that his dispatches contained &#145;too much wit and not enough warning&#146;  (Vansittart, 445), a statement which immediately calls to mind Phipps's celebrated account of his visit in June 1934 to Hermann Goering's bison enclosure in the Schorfheide. The &#145;bison dispatch&#146;, as it became known in the Foreign Office, combined a crushingly sarcastic pen portrait of Goering with a simple but telling warning about the growth of German air power. In concluding his report to Sir John Simon, Phipps wrote:<blockquote>The chief impression was that of the almost pathetic na&iuml;vet&eacute; of General Goering, who showed us his toys like a big, fat, spoilt child: his primeval woods, his bison and birds, his shooting-box and lake and bathing beach, his blonde &#145;private secretary&#146;, his wife's mausoleum and swans and sarsen stones, all mere toys to satisfy his varying moods, and all, or so nearly all, as he was careful to explain, Germanic. And then I remembered there were other toys, less innocent, though winged, and these might some day be launched on their murderous mission in the same childlike spirit and with the same childlike glee. (Woodward and others, <span class="italic">Documents</span>, 2nd ser., vol. 6, no. 452)</blockquote>Unmoved by Hitler's pleas for an intimate association with Great Britain, and equally unimpressed by his occasional violent outbursts, Phipps endured several difficult interviews with the F&uuml;hrer and only once lost his composure when, during one of their early conversations, he was unable to suppress a laugh when the German chancellor suggested that the Sturm-Abteilung and Schutzstaffel were comparable to the Salvation Army.<br>
<br>For all the light, even comic, touches which sometimes enlivened his dispatches, Phipps gave ample and frequent warning of Nazi intentions to his superiors in London, cataloguing with increasing conviction and intensity his fears and anxieties as the Nazi regime grew ever stronger. He periodically submitted lengthy and detailed examinations of German policy. These listed in order of priority the formidable territorial aims of the Nazi leaders and warned that Germany was a &#145;furiously &#147;expanding universe&#148;&#146;  (Woodward and others, <span class="italic">Documents</span>, 2nd ser., vol. 16, no. 177), as he put it in March 1936, whose people, economy, and armed forces were being ruthlessly prepared for external aggression. By spring 1937, having witnessed the remarkable but terrifying rejuvenation of the German military machine, the destruction of the Rhineland settlement, and the gradual deterioration of Anglo-German relations, he had abandoned all hope of coming to any satisfactory arrangement with Hitler. Germany could only be contained, if at all, he believed, through accelerated and extensive British rearmament, a close alliance with France, and as intimate an association as possible with the United States.<br>
<br>Phipps's well-founded suspicion of German aims, the consequent emphasis which he placed on the need for Anglo-French solidarity, and his tireless defence of British interests, earned him not only the respect and appreciation of his colleagues in Whitehall but also the undying hostility of the Nazis who saw in him a major obstacle to the Anglo-German alliance they so earnestly professed to desire. Shortly after the reoccupation of the Rhineland the Germans went so far as to attempt to enlist the support of prominent pro-German figures in British society in an effort to have him replaced as ambassador by a more amenable and malleable personality. When in April 1937 Phipps finally left Germany to succeed Sir George Clerk as British ambassador in Paris, the <span class="italic">Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung</span> bade him farewell with a graceless leading article which drew attention to the fact that during his period in Berlin Anglo-German relations had &#145;not been clarified on all points as far as might be wished&#146;  (Ogilvie-Forbes to the Foreign Office, 16 April 1937, TNA: PRO, C 2960/1495/18, FO 371/20747).<br>
<br>As the new British ambassador in Paris, his &#145;spiritual home&#146; according to Anthony Eden  (Avon, 503), Phipps spared no effort to strengthen ties between Britain and France. However, he found his task complicated by the lingering atmosphere of mistrust within the entente generated by successive crises in Abyssinia and the Rhineland, and, not least, by the deep political divisions in French society which had been exacerbated by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936. Nevertheless, his activities in Paris were widely regarded as having substantially contributed towards improving relations in the two years before war broke out. Conscious of the military strength of the axis powers, the psychological paralysis of French leaders in the face of a rejuvenated and rearmed Germany, and the relative general weakness of the democracies, Phipps supported Chamberlain's policies, all the more so in view of what he knew of the depleted state of the French armed forces. At the time of Munich he famously wrote that &#145;All that is best in France is against war, <i>almost</i> at any price&#146;  (Woodward and others, <span class="italic">Documents</span>, 3rd ser., vol. 2, no. 1076), an opinion which earned him the opprobrium of several senior Foreign Office officials, including his brother-in-law, Sir Robert Vansittart, who roundly accused him of defeatism. Phipps's attitude during the crises of 1938&#150;9 was certainly determined by his experiences in Berlin and his acknowledgement of German strength. Indeed, it could hardly have been otherwise, but the charge of defeatism and the slur of &#145;appeaser&#146; were certainly unwarranted, as some of his detractors later had the grace to admit. He continued to report dispassionately and objectively on the situation and mood in France during the summer and autumn of 1939. Although he remained convinced of the need to improve Anglo-French relations, he none the less felt obliged to alert the British government to the fact that defeatist sentiment had penetrated deep into the highest governmental circles in France&#151;a judgement at least partially borne out by the Third Republic's spectacularly rapid collapse in mid-1940.<br>
<br>After serving for forty years in the diplomatic service, over half of which he had spent in Paris, and falling now into increasingly frail health, Phipps retired on a pension in November 1939. At the request of the Foreign Office he agreed in February 1940 to broadcast to the French people, but France fell before the planned transmission could take place. From September 1939 until June 1940 he acted as chairman of the United Associations of Great Britain and France, the principal purpose of which was to provide aid and relief for French civilians affected by the war. Thereafter he retired to Wiltshire, where he acted as high sheriff in 1943&#150;4. During the war he also became a director of the Midland Bank. In the course of his long and distinguished career Phipps received numerous honours in recognition of his services to the British empire. He was made a GCB in 1941, having been promoted GCMG in 1934 and GCVO in 1939. He was also made a commander of the Belgian order of Leopold in 1922 and awarded the grand cross of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1938.<br>
<br>Phipps's French colleague during his period of service in Berlin, Andr&eacute; Fran&ccedil;ois-Poncet, spoke warmly in his memoirs of the kindness, humour, and insight of this &#145;charming man&#146; and &#145;great servant of the Entente Cordiale&#146; who had &#145;seen through Hitler's real nature and had never been a dupe of the Third Reich&#146;  (Fran&ccedil;ois-Poncet, 112). Above all else it was perhaps Phipps's endeavours to maintain and strengthen Anglo-French relations during the 1930s which provoked Hitler's bitter wartime reference to him as a &#145;complete thug&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hitler's Table-Talk</span>, 488), a description which, had he ever been made aware of it, would no doubt have brought a broad smile of satisfaction to the face of this astute and unflappable public servant. On 13 August 1945 he died suddenly at the London Clinic, 20 Devonshire Place, of a pulmonary embolism following a prostectomy. He was buried at Alton Barnes church, near Marlborough, on 18 August. Two days later a memorial service was held at St Margaret's, Westminster, at which the king and the foreign secretary were represented. He was survived by his second wife, Frances, and by five of his six children.<br>
