<span class="headword">Godwyn,  Charles</span>  (1701&#150;1770), <span class="occ">antiquary and book collector</span>, was born at Thornbury, in Gloucestershire, and was baptized there on 9 March 1701, the first child of Samuel Godwyn (<i>c</i>.1668&#150;1705?), who in 1702 succeeded his uncle Scudamore Godwyn as vicar of Wapley and rector of Filton, and his wife, Elizabeth Tipton, formerly of Bristol. The last in a veritable tribe of Godwyn clerics descended from Thomas Godwin, bishop of Bath and Wells, Charles had a brother, Samuel Godwyn (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1747), who was a Bristol surgeon. Having been educated in Bristol, Charles was admitted to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1718, graduated BA in 1721 (MA, 1724; incorporated at Cambridge, 1734), and was elected a probationer fellow of Balliol in 1722. He was ordained deacon and priest at Oxford in 1727 and 1728 respectively, and graduated BD in 1740. Though he held in turn the Balliol rectories of Riseholme, Lincolnshire (1746&#150;52), All Saints, Colchester (1752&#150;3), and Marks Tey, Essex (from 1753), he resided in Balliol all his adult life.<br>
<br>Godwyn took a full part in the business of the college&#151;which was relatively desultory in his time&#151;and was instrumental in obtaining a major benefaction from Henry Fisher (<i>c</i>.1693&#150;1773), vicar of Bere Regis, Dorset, which enabled the construction of a new building. He acquired a reputation as a painstaking tutor; Frederick, the profligate son of the poet Edward Young, was one of his charges. In other respects Godwyn's life was remarkably parallel to that of his eccentric colleague Joseph Sanford, devoted to private study and antiquarian pursuits. Like Sanford he was intimate with Benjamin Kennicot. Also like Sanford he published nothing but contributed freely to the work of others, especially John Hutchins and Richard Chandler, both of whom acknowledged the joint contribution of Sanford and Godwyn in prefaces to their books. And it was to his &#145;old friends&#146; Sanford and Godwyn jointly that George Coningesby (<i>c</i>.1693&#150;1766), rector of Pencombe, in Herefordshire, and a kindred spirit, left his extensive library of printed books and manuscripts in trust for Balliol. Godwyn also corresponded with other antiquarian scholars such as Philip Morant and Charles Gray (1696&#150;1782). A selective and scholarly numismatist, at some stage he acquired the coin cabinet of Heneage Finch, fifth earl of Winchilsea (<i>d</i>. 1726). By the end of his life he had amassed and catalogued over 3000 coins, mostly Greek, Roman, and English, starting with the early Saxon kings, and medals, including a notable long series of papal medals.<br>
<br>Godwyn was fully active until shortly before his death but in his later years he was troubled by fits, induced, he thought, by taking tea. He collapsed in his rooms on 23 April 1770, while his servant was out getting some cheesecakes, and died soon afterwards on the same day despite, or perhaps because of, the efforts of a physician to revive him by opening a vein in his temples. On 26 April, at his request, he was buried with minimal ceremony in Wolvercote church, some 2 miles from Oxford city centre. He had no known connection with Wolvercote church or village and probably chose it because it was an obscure rural location but not inconvenient for the six college servants whom he asked to carry him to his grave for a guinea each. An anonymous vacuous poetic lament was published in the <span class="italic">Reading Mercury and Oxford Gazette</span> on 14 May.<br>
<br>Godwyn made numerous modest bequests to friends and servants, including 20 guineas for the son of Thomas Bustin, who looked after his horse, and to Mr Robert Ashfield, a local parishioner, whom he asked to burn his papers, apart from his catalogues and recent accounts. There was a group of three family portraits in his rooms which he left to his cousin Mrs Mary Bromfield of Conduit Street, London, but they are still at Balliol. His books (about 1600 volumes, mostly on historical subjects), pamphlets (mostly on theological and literary subjects), coins, and medals he left to the Bodleian Library. He appointed the university itself to be his executor and residual beneficiary. About two-thirds of his library, including several important works of David Hume which had not been previously acquired, were retained by the Bodleian. As he had instructed, the books not required were sold, Fletchers' bookshop in the Turl disposing of the remainder in 1773 after members of the university had had their pick; the pamphlets formed the nucleus of a collection still known as the Godwyn pamphlets, numbering, with subsequent additions, over 30,000; the coins and medals, with Godwyn's meticulous catalogues, were transferred to the Ashmolean Museum in 1920. The residue of the estate, about &pound;1000, was invested for the benefit of the Bodleian. There is no memorial to Godwyn at Wolvercote, or in Balliol, but his name is on the great marble Bodleian benefactors' tablet.<br>
