<span class="headword">Gowdie,  Isobel</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1662), <span class="occ">alleged witch</span>, first appears as the wife of John Gilbert and an inhabitant of the farmstead at Loch Loy, near Auldearn, in highland Scotland. Although she was later supposed to have begun practising witchcraft in 1647, it was in spring 1662 that she was implicated in a plot to harm Henry Forbes (<i>fl</i>. 1655&#150;1678), the minister of the kirk at Auldearn, and appears to have come forward&#151;on her own account&#151;to confess her guilt before the local authorities of having been &#145;over long&#146; in the service of witchcraft (<span class="italic">Fasti Scot.</span>, 4.436; Pitcairn, 3, part 2, 603, 614). She gave four separate confessions at Auldearn between 13 April and 17 May 1662 in which the list of her crimes and accomplices was constantly refined and clarified by her examiners. She described how, in 1647, she had met the devil while out walking and had entered into a covenant with him. That same night she went to the kirk at Auldearn, where she denied her Christian baptism before the devil and received his mark on her shoulder. While she was held fast by her neighbour, Margaret Brodie, the devil supposedly sucked the blood from out of the mark and sprinkled it upon her head, declaring: &#145;I baptise thee, Janet, in my own name!&#146;  (Pitcairn, 3, part 2, 603). Having given herself in spirit to the devil Gowdie proceeded to give him exhaustive use of her body, and in her second confession provided lurid details of their sexual relationship.<br>
<br>Equipped with her new name and backed by a strong network of covens, Gowdie then supposedly began to wreak havoc upon her local community with the aid of her familiar spirit, known as the &#145;Read Reiver&#146;. She claimed to have ruined crops and to have soured milk, to have transformed herself&#151;at will&#151;into jackdaws, hares, and crows, and to have stolen into the houses of the local gentry in order to &#145;eat and drink of the best&#146;  (Pitcairn, 604). Indeed, the procuring and consumption of rich foods is a constant theme in all her confessions and seems to have been one of the greatest benefits that she felt she had received during her service to her dark master. However, it is clear that Isobel, in &#145;professing [her] repentance&#146; and her &#145;great grief and shame&#146;, was keen to please her interrogators and that her spoken testimony was heavily edited and led by them. Thus, her initial enthusiasm to tell of her meetings with the king and queen of the fairie, up in the &#145;Deunie-Hills&#146;, and to describe their appearances, together with the fearsome activities of the herds of &#145;elf-bulls&#146; that milled about them, was brusquely cut short and went largely unrecorded in the official case notes  (ibid., 604).<br>
<br>Demonology and not folklore was what concerned and motivated the authorities, and consequently the cataloguing of Gowdie's murderous crimes as a witch was what was demanded of her, and was what was duly revealed in her subsequent depositions. She had raised an unbaptized child from its grave at Nairn, caused the heirs of John Hay, laird of Park, to sicken, wither, and die, and had killed many men by flying through the air above them upon straws and shooting them down with special &#145;elf arrows&#146; that came to her straight from the hands of the devil himself  (Pitcairn, 615). Minister Forbes seems to have been singled out by the coven for particular attention and an underlying antagonism between him and Gowdie appears to have existed. Gowdie claimed to have begged the devil to be allowed to shoot at him again, after another witch's arrow fell short of its intended target. Moreover, she maintained that in winter 1660 the coven had sought to make his illness fatal by uttering incantations over a bag containing the &#145;galls, flesh and guts of toads&#146;, together with barley grains and nail and hair clippings, before hacking it to pieces and throwing the remains into water  (ibid., 610, 612). However, in repeatedly expressing her profound sorrow for killing her neighbour, William Brower of Milltown Moynes, Gowdie appears to have seen herself as having acted against her own will, and to have genuinely believed that she had been directly responsible for his death through her use of demonic magic. It is conceivable that this powerful sense of guilt was a major factor in prompting Gowdie to make her confessions and to demand that an exemplary sentence should be passed upon her, desiring that she should be riven upon iron harrows or &#145;worse, if it could be devised&#146;  (ibid., 613&#150;14).<br>
<br>Though Robert Pitcairn believed that Gowdie was probably convicted of witchcraft and subsequently burnt at the stake&#151;together with her accomplice, Janet Breadheid&#151;there is no record of her eventual fate. Her papers were forwarded to the Scottish privy council in summer 1662, and Sir Hew Campbell of Calder, together with eight others, was empowered to try the case, on 10 July 1662. However, it was recommended that the death sentence was to be passed only if a whole list of conditions regarding the prisoner's physical well-being and the state of her mental health was met in full. Not only was it important to prove beyond all doubt that Gowdie had confessed voluntarily and &#145;without any sort of torture&#146;, but, significantly, solid evidence was also required that &#145;at the tyme of their confessions &hellip; [Gowdie and Breadheid] were of sound judgment, nowayes distracted or under any earnest desyre to die&#146;. Only if Gowdie insisted upon reiterating and renewing her former confessions before the judiciary, &#145;then and in that case and no otherwayes&#146; should the death sentence be invoked  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 1.243). Given so many provisions for allowing an acquittal&#151;and no evidence of either a trial or an execution&#151;it would appear likely, though by no means certain, that Gowdie was eventually discharged and allowed to slip back into the quiet obscurity whence she came. Her husband had never been implicated in the witchcraft allegations.<br>
<br>The case has been recognized by successive generations of writers, from Sir Walter Scott onwards, as being both sensational and atypical, bringing the term &#145;coven&#146;&#151;to denote a group of witches&#151;into popular usage and attesting to a wealth of fairy lore in the highlands of Scotland that was far removed from the learned traditions of &eacute;lite demonologists. Unfortunately, the desire to make this one, particularly detailed, account general and to apply it, uncritically, to the <i>modus operandi</i> of English witches has been both misleading and unhelpful. In particular Margaret Murray's attempts to prove that Gowdie represented a powerful and enduring underground pagan tradition at work within the British Isles, by selectively quoting from her confessions, has been subjected to increasing scholarly criticism from the 1970s onwards and has largely been discredited. Rather than speaking for a prior folk culture Gowdie's wild imaginings can be more accurately viewed as articulating the concerns and frustrated desires of a poor and frequently hungry woman who wished for plentiful meat to feast upon, and a level of social and sexual freedom that was all too lacking in the hierarchical, and kirk dominated, Scotland of the mid-seventeenth century. <span class="italic">The confession of Isobel Gowdie</span>, an orchestral &#145;requiem&#146; by the Scottish composer James MacMillan, was premiered at the BBC Proms in 1990 and has been performed many times since.<br>
