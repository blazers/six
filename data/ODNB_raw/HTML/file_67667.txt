<span class="headword">Pennant,  Violet Blanche  Douglas-</span>  (1869&#150;1945), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born on 31 January 1869 at 23 Chapel Street, Belgrave Square, London, the sixth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32878/', "George Sholto Gordon Douglas-Pennant, second Baron Penrhyn (1836&#150;1907)")</script>, JP and MP for Caernarvonshire, and his first wife, Pamela Blanche (1839&#150;1869), who died five days after her daughter's birth, daughter of Sir Charles Rushout of Sezincote, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Cecilia Olivia Geraldine. Her father, a Welsh peer, was of Scottish descent, and her mother English. After a conventional upbringing Douglas-Pennant threw herself into philanthropy and local government. An interest in girls' youth clubs led to her becoming a volunteer worker with disabled children and the unemployed poor in London; she later acted as manager of various schools, and she served on Finsbury borough council's unemployment committee. Her interest in the Workers' Educational Association took her onto other local government committees in south London, some dealing with workers' pensions, and ultimately onto the London county council education committee. She also became a governor of the University College of South Wales, and was on its selection and executive committee for training women medical students. Though not a suffragette, she was on the council of the Conservative and Unionist Women's Franchise Association. In 1911 she was appointed national health insurance commissioner for south Wales. In the same year she became a lady-in-waiting to Princess Louise, the duchess of Argyll; during the early years of the First World War she accompanied Louise on visits to the British Red Cross hospitals in France. Douglas-Pennant had already raised money in 1914 to fund a 500-bed emergency hospital in Belgium, was a member of the South Wales Belgian Refugee Committee, and had chaired a selection committee on nursing staff for the Scottish Women's Hospital unit in Serbia. In 1917 she had been one of the moving spirits behind the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC), and had later made recruiting speeches for the new Women's Royal Naval Service and the Women's Legion. Thus, although she had no direct experience of the new air force, she was a natural choice when the position of commandant of the Women's Royal Air Force (WRAF) became vacant.<br>
<br>The WRAF started with three different commandants in six months&#151;a record that few organizations could survive. The reason was that near the end of the First World War, on 1 April 1918, the WRAF was created at the same time as the Royal Air Force, but the WRAF was a last-minute decision. Its nucleus was to be women formerly serving on air stations, who were to transfer from the army, the navy, and the British Legion, and the WRAF suffered from such a scrambled start. Its first commandant left after only a month, dismayed at its problems. Violet Douglas-Pennant was its second. She was the choice of Sir Godfrey Paine, director general of RAF manning. At forty-nine she was a handsome, dark-eyed woman of action, a fine public speaker with a silvery laugh and great charm. She later recalled, &#145;I was asked to take over the position on May 13 [1918]&#151;unlucky day &hellip; and at first declined, but afterwards agreed to take a month's look around &hellip; I knew there had been serious difficulties before&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Aeroplane</span>, 15 Jan 1919, 308). Subsequently, on a week's tour, she found 14,000 WRAF supervised by only 75 officers scattered over 500 or so camps, many under inexperienced commanding officers. Some girls were without their promised uniforms and bonuses, in bad living and working conditions, and were undisciplined and prone to strike. Douglas-Pennant quickly saw that the root of the problem was a shortage of WRAF officers: existing provisions had trained only twenty-five in three weeks, while Berridge House, which was on loan to the RAF and had the capacity to train several hundred officers, stood empty. Her efforts to equip Berridge House met with endless bureaucratic delays, as she was expected to work through hidebound, often hostile, intermediaries. She wrote to Paine on 11 June, &#145;I am very sorry to be obliged to decline the appointment of Commandant &hellip; seeming to assume responsibilities to which I was not entitled, so I was blocked at every turn&#146;  (Mitchell, 231&#150;2). Determined to keep her, Paine promised to have RAF orders defining her position published. Unfortunately this was not done until November, but her appointment was confirmed on 18 June.<br>
<br>Meanwhile nothing improved: necessary transport was rarely available; uniforms were still delayed; and, with no secretarial help, office work accumulated. The attitude of Douglas-Pennant's three deputies was casual and influenced by inter-service jealousies: five ladies who expected top jobs in the WRAF, but were offered lower ones, left in a huff, then Douglas-Pennant's deputies resigned <i>en bloc</i>. Douglas-Pennant brought in a clerk from her former staff and, with two RAF friends, she toiled late, dealing with neglected correspondence, ordering a chaotic filing system, and planning. She advised Lord Weir, secretary of state for air, to slow down WRAF recruiting, while through her London county council contacts she &#145;borrowed&#146; Eltham Teacher Training College during the vacation, where she eventually trained 450 of her officers. Nevertheless, after three adverse parliamentary questions, on 3 August, Douglas-Pennant was overworked and frustrated, and she made two further attempts to resign, which Paine again rejected, assuring her of his approval and support.<br>
<br>Dissatisfaction with the WRAF was growing however. On 22 August the minister of national service wrote to Weir, &#145;I propose to embargo recruiting for the WRAF if things are not improved&#146;  (Reader, 78). To this Weir replied, &#145;I have made up my mind to supersede Miss Violet Pennant&#146;  (Mitchell, 234), and he delegated this task to Paine's replacement, General Sir Sefton Brancker. Brancker spent his first four days in post studying WRAF problems. His opinion that the commandant was meddlesome was reinforced when she refused certain WRAF accommodation as unsuitable and complained of immorality at Hurst Park, where his friend was commanding officer. On 27 August Douglas-Pennant was away settling a strike of 1000 women in Berkshire, but on the next day, summoned to Brancker's office, he told her brusquely, &#145;You have got to go, not because you are inefficient &hellip; [he thought she was efficient enough] but because you are so unpopular&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Aeroplane</span>, 15 Jan 1919, 308). When? &#145;Now! At once! Tomorrow morning!&#146;  (Izzard, 194). White and rigid with shock, she refused his outstretched hand and left, though she conscientiously remained in her office for five days to clear outstanding work.<br>
<br>The injudicious and callous dismissal of Violet Douglas-Pennant caused much publicity and public sympathy. A pamphlet war ensued, and her cause, somewhat exaggeratedly, became known as the British Dreyfus case. The two officers most involved with her dismissal were retired or demoted; there was a private inquiry by the prime minister's office; and there were debates in parliament, a select committee inquiry in the House of Lords, and libel suits, as well as Douglas-Pennant's own private crusade, which was ended only by her death on 12 October 1945. She never married.<br>
<br>An innocent in the military world, Violet Douglas-Pennant was too much of a lady to bully and she lacked the right contacts within the military's higher echelons to apply pressure in the right quarters. These qualities, however, were possessed in abundance by her successor, Mrs Helen Gwynne-Vaughan. This lady had been chief controller of the WAAC in France since March 1917 and, under the urgent persuasion of Major-General Brancker, had agreed to become the third commandant of the WRAF. She inherited the undeniable groundwork laid down so painfully by Violet Douglas-Pennant. It had blighted Douglas-Pennant's fruitful public career, her mental health, and the rest of her life.<br>
