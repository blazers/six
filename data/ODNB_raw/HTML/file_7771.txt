<span class="headword">Doig,  David</span>  (1718/19&#150;1800), <span class="occ">writer on history and philosophy</span>, was born at Monifieth, Forfarshire, where he was baptized on 17 February 1719. His father, also David Doig, who was a small farmer, died while his son was an infant, and his mother remarried. Because of poor eyesight Doig did not learn to read until he was twelve; but after only three years at the parochial school he was successful in a Latin competition for a bursary at the University of St Andrews. Having completed the classical and philosophical course with distinction, Doig graduated BA. He began the study of divinity, but scruples regarding the Westminster confession of faith prevented him from entering the ministry. From 1749 he taught in the parochial schools of Monifieth and of Kennoway and Falkland in Fife. A few years later his growing reputation gained him the rectorship of the grammar school of Stirling, an office which he held for more than forty years. In addition to Greek and Latin, Doig mastered Hebrew and Arabic, and was generally well read in the history and literature of the Middle East and India. The University of Glasgow conferred on him the honorary degree of LLD, and on the same day he received from St Andrews his MA. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.<br>
<br>Doig published three separate works. The first was some twenty pages of annotation on the <span class="italic">Gaberlunzie-Man</span> included in <span class="italic">Two Ancient Scottish Poems</span> (1782), edited by his friend and neighbour John Callander of Craigforth. The purpose of the annotations was to illustrate etymological principles set out in Callander's preface by tracing European languages to Asian roots. In 1792 he published his most significant work, <span class="italic">Two Letters on the Savage State, Addressed to the Late Lord Kaims</span>. Dated 1774&#150;6 and written in immediate response to Kames's <span class="italic">Sketches of the History of Man</span> (1774), the letters attack the view, prominent among the moderate literati and their friends, that human nature is perfectible and that history is progressive. Doig, whose thought was shaped by the Episcopalian traditions of St Andrews as well as by his close friendship with the Episcopal clergyman George Gleig, argued that human nature is corrupt and that history demonstrates degeneration rather than progress. Whenever progress does occur, it is the result of the direct interposition of Providence. Doig's eventual decision to publish the letters in the midst of the French Revolution, with a dedication to George Horne, bishop of Norwich and outspoken critic of David Hume and Adam Smith, suggests that he had come to see himself as part of a Scottish reaction against perfectibility, infidelity, and revolution. His third publication was a topographical poem reflecting his historical and antiquarian interests. Entitled <span class="italic">Extracts from a Poem on the Prospect from Stirling Castle</span> (1796), the poem consists of five distinct parts.<br>
<br>Besides his separate works, Doig contributed a dissertation, &#145;On the ancient Hellenes&#146;, to the Royal Society of Edinburgh's <span class="italic">Transactions</span> (1794). A continuation which he forwarded to the society was lost and never appeared. He also wrote for the third edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, edited by George Gleig, the articles &#145;Mythology&#146;, &#145;Mysteries&#146;, and &#145;Philology&#146;. They attracted great attention and brought Doig into contact with such eminent scholars as William Vincent, dean of Westminster, and Jacob Bryant. In addition to Latin and English poems, he left many treatises in manuscript on a wide range of philological, religious, and historical subjects.<br>
<br>Doig, who married and had children, died at Stirling on 16 March 1800, aged eighty-one. A mural tablet, with an inscription in commemoration of his virtues and learning, was raised by his friend John Ramsay of Ochtertyre. The town of Stirling also erected a marble monument to his memory, which contains his own Latin epitaph.<br>
