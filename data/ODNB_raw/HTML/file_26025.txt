<span class="headword">Somerville,  Thomas</span>  (1741&#150;1830), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and historian</span>, was born at Hawick, Roxburghshire, on 15 February 1741, the fifth child and only son of the parish minister, William Somerville (1691&#150;1757), and Janet Grierson (<i>d</i>. 1749), daughter of John Grierson, the minister of Queensferry. He left behind a valuable autobiographical memoir, written in 1813&#150;14 and published posthumously in 1861 as <span class="italic">My Own Life and Times, 1741&#150;1814</span>, which documents the first seventy-three years of his life and contains perceptive observations on the cultural, social, and ecclesiastical history of the Scottish lowlands, especially the borders, during the late eighteenth century. According to that account, Somerville attended local schools in Hawick and then the school in Duns, Berwickshire, where his education was supervised by the local minister, his relative Adam Dickson, the agricultural historian. From November 1756 he studied arts and subsequently divinity at the University of Edinburgh, benefiting particularly from participation in two student clubs, the Theological Society and the Belles Lettres Society. The unexpected death of his father during his first year at university caused him to move to Edinburgh with his sisters, relying largely on the support of his father's friends and relations, including his father's patron, Lord Somerville. George Burges, the latter's son-in-law, brought young Thomas to Somerville House from 1759 to 1767 as the tutor of his son, James Bland Burges. During this difficult period Thomas and his three surviving siblings petitioned the courts to recover 6000 merks allegedly owed to their father's second wife, Isabel Scott, who had died in 1759.<br>
<br>Having been licensed by the presbytery of Edinburgh on 28 November 1764, Somerville gained clerical experience substituting for George Wishart at the Tron Church, Edinburgh, for a period of nine months, as we know from a joint recommendation letter of 28 April 1766 sent to Sir Gilbert Elliot of Minto, in Roxburghshire, by Wishart and his colleague at the Tron, John Jardine  (Minto MS 11016, fols. 72&#150;3). In December 1766 Elliot presented Somerville to the little parish of Minto, where he was ordained on 24 April 1767. During his six years there he tutored Elliot's two sons (one of whom would become the first earl of Minto), met David Hume and many of Sir Gilbert's other friends, made the first of his five visits to London in 1769, and married on 5 June 1770 Martha Charters (<i>d</i>. 1809), daughter of the solicitor of customs Samuel Charters and cousin of Somerville's closest friend, the Revd Samuel Charters of Wilton. The couple had five surviving children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26027/', "William Somerville (1771&#150;1860)")</script>, an eminent physician and traveller, whose wife, the mathematician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26024/', "Mary Somerville")</script>, was Thomas Somerville's niece by marriage and received her earliest intellectual encouragement from him. On 13 August 1771 Samuel Charters senior wrote to Elliot to promote the placement of his son-in-law in Jedburgh, &#145;one of the best Livings being above &pound;100 besides the Gleeb and Manse&#146;, which was formally in the gift of the crown but actually at the disposal of the marquess of Lothian  (Minto MS 11019, fol. 1). Elliot accordingly wrote to Lothian, who gave him a promise of support on 14 September 1771  (ibid., fol. 3), and on 27 July 1772 Somerville was presented to Jedburgh, where he would remain for the rest of his life, though the parishioners' opposition to ecclesiastical patronage delayed his admission until 1 July 1773.<br>
<br>Somerville was affiliated with the politically conservative &#145;moderate&#146; party, which supported ecclesiastical patronage and the British policy in the American War of Independence. In 1781 he published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Candid Thoughts, or, An Enquiry into the Causes of National Discontents</span>, which supported the policies of Lord North against the colonists and was answered the following year by Thomas Tod's <span class="italic">Consolatory Thoughts on American Independence</span>. But he disappointed moderate leaders, and cost himself a chance to be moderator of the general assembly, by increasingly refusing to toe the party line. For example, he backed the &#145;popular&#146; party candidate for moderator in 1783 and campaigned aggressively for repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> in 1790&#150;91. He initially supported the French Revolution, though he eventually changed course and in 1793 published two pamphlets against the revolution and its feared consequences in Britain: <span class="italic">The Effects of the French Revolution</span> and <span class="italic">Observations on the Constitution and Present State of Britain</span>. In regard to the slave trade, which the moderates also opposed, he stirred up controversy simply by being so zealous, as his memoir relates, concerning his published sermon <span class="italic">A discourse on our obligation to thanksgiving, for the prospect of the abolition of the African slave-trade</span> (1792).<br>
<br>Somerville was a diligent pastor and a well-respected preacher. Two of his sermons were selected for inclusion in the <span class="italic">Scotch Preacher</span> (vol. 2, 1776, and vol. 3, 1779), and a volume of his sermons was published at Edinburgh in 1813. He wrote the accounts of two parishes, Jedburgh and Ancrum, in Sir John Sinclair's <span class="italic">Statistical Account of Scotland</span> (1791&#150;9). His greatest accomplishment as an author, however, was the publication of two large quarto histories: <span class="italic">The history of political transactions, and of parties, from the Restoration of King Charles the Second, to the death of King William</span>, published in London in early spring 1792 by Andrew Strahan and Thomas Cadell, and its sequel, <span class="italic">The History of Great Britain during the Reign of Queen Anne</span>, published in 1798 by Strahan along with the firm of Cadell and Davies. Based on extensive research in London and Edinburgh, these volumes contained much new information and analysis, including a discussion of the Union of 1707 that dealt frankly with its initial unpopularity in Scotland. There were good reviews, and William Robertson praised the first work and encouraged the second. Yet neither book sold well, and both have been largely neglected by scholars of British and Scottish historiography. Somerville was indignant at being branded a tory historian by Charles James Fox, and he defended his whig credentials in an updated pamphlet, <span class="italic">Observations on a passage in the preface to Mr Fox's historical work, relative to the character of Dr Somerville as an historian</span>. Having been motivated to become a historian by &#145;pecuniary embarrassments&#146;, as he wrote in his memoir  (T. Somerville, 205), Somerville was disappointed to receive only &pound;300 for his first history and attributed its failure to reach a second edition (which would have brought him an additional &pound;200) to the &#145;horrors of the French Revolution&#146;  (ibid., 256). His second experience was still more frustrating, for he turned down an initial offer of &pound;300 for <span class="italic">Queen Anne</span> in hopes of getting more, but ended up earning far less when the 200 copies of the book that he finally received as compensation proved more difficult to sell by subscription than he had anticipated.<br>
<br>Somerville received an honorary DD degree from the University of St Andrews on 17 July 1789. The publication of his first history, along with his political pamphlets, gained him a &pound;50-a-year sinecure in 1793 as one of his majesty's chaplains-in-ordinary, which was upgraded to a more prestigious chaplaincy in 1798 and finally, in 1800, to a pension worth &pound;100 per annum. One week after preaching an animated sermon and dispensing the Lord's supper to his congregation, he died &#145;Father of the Church&#146; aged eighty-nine on 16 May 1830, and was buried in Jedburgh Abbey.<br>
