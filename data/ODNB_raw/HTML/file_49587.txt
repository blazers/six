<span class="headword">Bowen,  Edward George</span>  (1911&#150;1991), <span class="occ">radiophysicist</span>, was born on 14 January 1911 in Cockett, Glamorgan, Wales, the youngest of four children of George Bowen (1872&#150;1959), steelworker and later insurance agent, and his wife, Ellen Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Owen, who was born in nearby Pembry in 1876. He was educated at Cockett infants' school, Sketty elementary school, and the municipal secondary school, from where he went with a state scholarship to University College, Swansea, graduating with a first-class degree in physics (1930), an MSc (1931), and a fellowship (1932) for PhD studies at King's College, London, with E. V. Appleton. On 27 December 1938 he married Enid Vesta Williams (<i>b</i>. 1910/11), daughter of Benjamin Thomas Williams, grocer. She was a science teacher whom he had met at university. They had three sons: Edward, David, and John.<br>
<br>Early in 1935 Bowen was selected by Robert Watson Watt, the &#145;father&#146; of British radar, to help A. F. Wilkins develop the first air warning equipment at Orfordness, Suffolk; Bowen built the high-power transmitter. A year later the group moved into nearby Bawdsey Manor to plan the vital chain of coastal warning stations. Bowen, however, accepted the challenge of devising radars for aircraft&#151;one type, aircraft to surface vessel radar (ASV), for locating surface vessels, the other, air interception radar (AI), for intercepting night bombers. In September 1937 he unofficially demonstrated his experimental ASV's potential by locating the British fleet, during North Sea exercises, in visibility so poor that Coastal Command aircraft had abandoned their search. His later sets were a major factor in defeating submarines attacking Atlantic convoys. For technical and operational reasons, Bowen's first AI radars were not successful in the RAF in late 1939, but the technical deficiencies were fixed in 1940 with limited modifications and thorough engineering (AI mark IV). However, Bowen clashed with Superintendent A. P. Rowe, whose deputy, W. B. Lewis, had intervened in the modifications without consulting Bowen. After May 1940 Bowen ceased taking an active part in his group's work, but his AI mark IV, with the operational problems solved, was decisive in the 1941 night raids.<br>
<br>In August 1940 Bowen became the radar member of Sir Henry Tizard's mission to North America. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, he helped establish the radiation laboratory and its programmes, based on the new British magnetron, the top-secret key to microwave radar. Afterwards he worked to ensure effective liaison with Britain. Late in 1943 he was recruited in Boston by Professor F. W. G. White for Australia's radar centre, the radiophysics laboratory in Sydney. On 1 January 1944 he became White's deputy for research.<br>
<br>Bowen was chief of the radiophysics laboratory from May 1946 to 1971. His first ventures were to edit <span class="italic">A Textbook of Radar</span> (1947), by the staff, and to develop peacetime radar applications, especially for civil aviation. Later two programmes dominated research. J. L. Pawsey's group studied radio radiation from space. With Pawsey's outstanding scientific ability, supported by Bowen's management skills, it won international recognition in the emerging science of radio astronomy. The second programme, directed by Bowen, explored the physics of rainfall and its stimulation. Systematic cloud seeding over twenty-four years established world leadership. The detailed mechanism underlying Bowen's persistence hypothesis has since been largely explained, but his speculations about the roles of meteor showers and the moon in rainfall periodicities remain controversial.<br>
<br>By the 1950s observational radio astronomers needed much higher resolution. Pawsey's group made progress with interferometric solutions, but Bowen judged correctly that building a giant steerable paraboloid would be quicker. He organized comprehensive London studies of the engineering problems and negotiated substantial American funding. When completed in 1961 at Parkes, New South Wales, the 210 foot telescope was the outstanding instrument of its type, but curtailment of the brilliant interferometry approach split Pawsey's group.<br>
<br>Bowen played a vital role in the Anglo-Australian 153 inch optical telescope (AAT) for Siding Spring Mountain, New South Wales. Between 1968 and 1973 he chaired the majority of the meetings of the interim joint policy committee and its permanent successor, the AAT board, which had overall project responsibility. Design and construction were entrusted to their project office in Canberra. Bowen, who could draw on experience with the new radio telescope technology at Parkes, steered the enterprise through many crises. The result was a telescope in 1974 with an unsurpassed performance for its size. By 1970, however, dissent had surfaced over the facility's eventual management. At a board meeting in 1972 to settle the issue, Bowen voted for the British position. In 1973, when he accepted a three-year appointment as scientific counsellor at the Australian embassy in Washington, DC, the government forced his resignation from the board. After his embassy appointment ended in 1976 he retired to Maryland before returning to Sydney in 1978.<br>
<br>Bowen published sixty-two papers and a second book, <span class="italic">Radar Days</span> (1987). His honours included the US medal for freedom (1947), appointment as CBE (1962), and fellowship of the Royal Society (1975). Athletic and dynamic, he enjoyed competitive cricket and sailing. He was an ardent Welshman, known to friends as Taffy. In December 1987 he suffered a stroke, and he gradually deteriorated. He died on 12 August 1991, at the Ashley House Nursing Home, Chatswood, Sydney, Australia. His body was cremated at the Northern Suburbs memorial gardens and crematorium, North Ryde, Sydney, four days later.<br>
