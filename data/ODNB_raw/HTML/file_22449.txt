<span class="headword">Pole,  John  de la</span>, earl of Lincoln  (<em>c.</em>1460&#150;1487), <span class="occ">magnate and rebel</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22450/', "John de la Pole, second duke of Suffolk (1442&#150;1492)")</script>, and Elizabeth (1444&#150;1503/4), sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8520/', "Edward IV")</script>, who had married by the beginning of 1458. He was created earl of Lincoln on 13 March 1467, and was knighted with the king's sons on 18 April 1475. He played his part in court ceremonial: he attended Anne Mowbray at her wedding to the duke of York in January 1478, bore the salt at the baptism of Edward IV's daughter Bridget in November 1480, and was present at the king's funeral and interment in 1483. He carried the orb at the coronation of Richard III.<br>
<br>Lincoln supported Richard against the rebels of October 1483 and was rewarded the following April with land worth &pound;157, and the reversion of Beaufort estates worth a further &pound;178 after the death of Thomas, Lord Stanley, who had been granted a life interest in the land which his wife, Margaret Beaufort, had forfeited for her part in the rising. In the following month Lincoln was granted an annuity of &pound;177 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. from the duchy of Cornwall until the reversion materialized. When Richard's only son, Edward, died in April 1484 no heir was formally designated, but the appointment of Lincoln to the lieutenantship of Ireland on 21 August may have been intended to signal that he, rather than Clarence's son Edward, earl of Warwick, was regarded as the heir apparent. Lincoln was also made president of the council in the north, set up in the summer of 1484 as the successor to the prince's council, which had itself replaced Gloucester's ducal council as a way of maintaining Richard's authority in the north. Lincoln's lack of independent standing in the north meant that he would act for the king, rather than in his own right. He was with the king at Nottingham on 1 August 1485 and, although not mentioned in any chronicle accounts, was probably present at Bosworth since the earliest report wrongly lists him among the dead. He escaped attainder&#151;perhaps the &#145;great and sovereign kindness&#146; to which Henry VII referred after the earl's subsequent defection  (<span class="italic">RotP</span>, 6.397)&#151;and, unlike the earl of Northumberland, seems not even to have been imprisoned. He was present at Henry's coronation at the end of October.<br>
<br>Lincoln's apparent attachment to the Tudor cause continued throughout 1486. He was with Henry VII at York in spring 1486, after the collapse of the rebellion of Lovell and Humphrey Stafford, and headed the inquiry into Stafford's treason. He was present at the christening of Prince Arthur at Worcester in September, and was still with the court at Greenwich on All Saints' day. He was present at Sheen in February 1487, when the existence of an impostor claiming to be the earl of Warwick was discussed and it was decided to show the real earl of Warwick to the people. Almost immediately afterwards, however, Lincoln fled to Flanders to join Viscount Lovell, and in his subsequent act of attainder the beginning of his treason is dated to 19 March, although later accounts suggest that he may have been implicated in the conspiracy before his flight.<br>
<br>With German and Swiss mercenaries provided by Margaret of York, dowager duchess of Burgundy, Lincoln and Lovell sailed for Ireland, and on 24 May a boy claiming to be the earl of Warwick was crowned &#145;Edward VI&#146; at Dublin. On 4 June the rebels, their forces enlarged by Irish soldiers provided by the earl of Kildare and led by Thomas Fitzgerald, landed in Furness. They headed first east, into the Ricardian heartland of the North Riding, and then turned south. They had the better of a skirmish with Lord Clifford at Tadcaster, and reputedly drove back another detachment of royal troops. But, as in 1486, few former Ricardians of any standing joined them, and when on 16 June they faced a much larger royal army at Stoke near Newark (Nottinghamshire) they were defeated. Lincoln died in the battle&#151;to the annoyance of Henry VII, according to Polydore Vergil, who claimed that Henry had wanted him taken alive, so that he might learn more about the conspiracy  (Bennett, 137&#150;8). His body was buried in an unmarked grave on the battlefield.<br>
<br>Lincoln was posthumously attainted in the parliament of November 1487. The rights of his father (and by implication those of his widow) were protected in the lands which had been settled on Lincoln at his marriage to Margaret Fitzalan. She was the daughter of Thomas Fitzalan and Margaret Woodville, the sister of Edward IV's queen. Margaret and Thomas had been betrothed in October 1464, so the Fitzalan&#150;Lincoln match is unlikely to have been made much before the late 1470s, and perhaps even later: the duke of Suffolk presented to the living of one of the manors in 1480. There were no children of the marriage. Margaret was still living in October 1524 when her father bequeathed her a great ring with a turquoise. She apparently never remarried.<br>
