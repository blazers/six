<span class="headword">Rogers, Sir  Frank Jarvis</span>  (1920&#150;2005), <span class="occ">journalist and newspaper executive</span>, was born on 24 February 1920 at Holly Villas, Church Lawton, Cheshire, the son of Percy Rogers (<i>d</i>. 1960), an earthenware manufacturer, and his wife, Elsie Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jarvis (<i>d</i>. 1956). He was educated at Wolstanton grammar school, Staffordshire, leaving at the age of seventeen to become a trainee on the sports desk of the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> in Manchester. Within three years he had become the newspaper's correspondent in Sheffield. In those first years as a journalist, as he would later recall, he stumbled across the kind of restrictive industrial practices that characterized the national press for decades, and that he would spend much of his later career attempting to control. The local chapel of the National Union of Journalists complained that, although designated a reporter, he had been carrying with him the equipment by which photographers transmitted their pictures, and so was effectively doing someone else's job.<br>
<br>In 1940 Rogers was conscripted into the Royal Army Service Corps, serving in north Africa and Italy. When the war ended in 1945 he returned to the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> and worked in several regional offices before applying in 1949 to be editor of the Nigerian <span class="italic">Daily Times</span>, recently acquired by the Mirror Group. On 23 July the same year he married Esm&eacute; Elizabeth Sophia (Esma) Holland (<i>d</i>. 1998), a 21-year-old receptionist and bookkeeper, and daughter of Arthur Edwin Holland, builder. They had two daughters. After two years in Lagos, Rogers decided that his talents were better suited to administration than journalism and he switched to being the paper's general manager. In 1952 he was sent to Melbourne to manage <span class="italic">The Argus</span>, the Mirror Group's most recent acquisition.<br>
<br>By now Rogers had caught the eye of Cecil King, the Mirror Group's chairman, who recalled him to London in 1955 as his personal assistant. Three years later he was made managing director of Overseas Newspapers, the division of the company that ran its west African publications, based in London. In 1960 he was appointed to the board of the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, then at the peak of its success with a circulation approaching 5 million&#151;a sixfold increase in the twenty-three years since he had joined it. His particular responsibility was industrial relations, meaning that he spent many hours in negotiation with the print unions, whose power to halt production at will won them repeated concessions over pay and manning levels. Later he would characterize the employers' attitude at the time as &#145;a totally inexplicable syndrome of weakness and spinelessness and plain poor management&#146;, adding: &#145;Managements let themselves be tyrannized&#146;  (private information). He came to recognize that eventually the proprietors would have to engineer a showdown with the unions, but it would be another two decades before they were finally forced to abandon their resistance to change.<br>
<br>In 1961 the Mirror Group won a takeover battle with Robert Maxwell to acquire Odhams Press, and the combined group became the International Publishing Corporation (IPC). Apart from its portfolio of profitable magazines, Odhams published two national newspapers, <span class="italic">The People</span> and the failing <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>. Rogers and Hugh Cudlipp, the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>'s editorial director, were the prime movers in transforming the <span class="italic">Herald</span> into <span class="italic">The Sun</span> in 1964, aiming to create a hybrid between a tabloid and a serious broadsheet that would appeal to the modern generation. It failed to do so and after five loss-making years King and Cudlipp decided to sell it cheaply to Rupert Murdoch, the young Australian who had recently bought the <span class="italic">News of the World</span>. Rogers, who had been appointed managing director of IPC in 1965, was opposed to the sale, foreseeing correctly that Murdoch would transform <span class="italic">The Sun</span> into a powerful competitor with the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>. He advocated closing <span class="italic">The Sun</span> down; but Cudlipp and King feared that this would antagonize the unions and provoke industrial trouble at the group's other publications.<br>
<br>In 1968 Rogers was intimately involved with Cudlipp in the palace coup by which King was ousted. The chairman, increasingly gloomy about the state of the nation, had promoted a scheme to replace Harold Wilson's Labour government with a national government led by Lord Mountbatten, in which he imagined he would play a role. The board were appalled by this and, when King refused to resign, they dismissed him and appointed Cudlipp as chairman. Later Rogers was to admit that, although King had to go, it was a mistake to choose Cudlipp as his successor: &#145;He had all the wrong skills&#146;, he said  (Dudley Edwards, 415). King was allowed to address the company's annual general meeting and took the opportunity to denounce those who had engineered his dismissal. While he praised Rogers's handling of the print unions in his previous role, he criticized his performance as managing director. He proved right, in that IPC fared poorly after his departure and in 1970, on Rogers's initiative, it became a subsidiary of the Reed Paper Group. Very soon Rogers was dismissed by Reed's chairman, Don Ryder.<br>
<br>On leaving the company where he had until then spent his entire career Rogers's first appointment was as chairman of the National Newspaper Steering Group, a committee of employers and union leaders charged with improving the industry's labour relations. It was a measure of the respect in which he was held by his peers that he was chosen to serve for many years on other industry bodies, including the Newspaper Publishers' Association and the International Press Institute. In 1971 he was appointed to the board of East Midland Allied Press, becoming chairman in 1973. He held that position for seventeen years, overseeing the company's transformation from a small regional newspaper group to a powerful publisher of national magazines. He still found himself in regular confrontation with the print unions, having to endure a six-month strike by journalists on the <span class="italic">Northamptonshire Evening Telegraph</span> in Kettering, who were seeking to make union membership compulsory.<br>
<br>In 1985 Rogers moved back into the world of national newspapers. At the suggestion of Andrew Knight, editor of <span class="italic">The Economist</span>, the Canadian entrepreneur Conrad Black had bought a minority interest in the Daily Telegraph Group and invited Rogers to serve as one of his nominated representatives on the board. Some months later Black assumed full control, appointing Knight as his chief executive and Rogers deputy chairman, in which role he used his experience in negotiating with the print unions to pave the way for the introduction of computerized technology. By now he had come to be regarded as a hard-headed elder statesman of the industry, a status endorsed when he was knighted in 1988. As chairman of the Newspaper Publishers' Association he was a key figure in the establishment of the Press Complaints Commission in 1990, replacing the Press Council as the industry's self-regulatory body. Instances of intrusion by the media had fuelled demands for privacy legislation, which Rogers and most others in the industry opposed. By enforcing its code of conduct the commission sought to show that such legislation was unnecessary. He remained on the Telegraph board until he was eighty, stepping down in 2001, shortly before Black had to dispose of his newspaper empire to face charges of financial irregularities in the United States.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife, on 3 January 2001 Rogers married Sheena Phillips, a widowed, 52-year-old general nurse, daughter of Peter Mulvie, accountant. She nursed him through a long illness until on 19 July 2005 he died from cerebrovascular disease at his home, Greensleeves, Loudwater Drive, Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire. He was survived by his second wife and the two daughters of his first marriage.<br>
