<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ayrton <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em> Ayrton Gould]</span>,  Michael</span>  (1921&#150;1975), <span class="occ">artist and writer</span>, was born at 3 Hamilton Terrace, St John's Wood, London, on 20 February 1921, the only child of Gerald Gould (1885&#150;1936), poet and journalist, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50046/', "Barbara Bodichon Ayrton Gould (1886&#150;1950)")</script>, politician and sometime chairman of the Labour Party, and whose maiden name he adopted on becoming a practising artist. His early childhood was much influenced by his maternal grandmother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37136/', "Sarah (Hertha) Ayrton")</script>, and his uncle, the distinguished Jewish writer Israel Zangwill, whose son, the eminent psychologist Oliver Zangwill, had considerable influence on him.<br>
<br>Ayrton attended a co-educational private school but left at an early date. He was later educated at the Hall School in Hampstead, London (<i>c</i>.1927&#150;1932), and The Beeches, a progressive boarding-school at Greater Felcourt in Sussex (<i>c</i>.1932&#150;1935). At The Beeches, when aged fourteen, he had a brief affair with the French mistress, which resulted in her dismissal back to France and the traditional summons of the father by the headmaster. Gould was so relieved by the reason for his summons that he immediately removed his son from the school, terminated his formal education, and encouraged his artistic talents.<br>
<br>This early end to Ayrton's formal education undoubtedly contributed to his relentless autodidacticism which was to spur the massive erudition which made him such an effective broadcaster on the BBC's long-running and immensely successful programmes <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/57624', "The Brains Trust")</script> and <span class="italic">Round Britain Quiz</span>. It also made him so formidable an opponent of academics in general and art historians in particular, who were foolish enough to patronize and underestimate the teenage school-leaver who never went to university. His first published work was a ferocious George Grosz-like anti-Nazi cartoon in <span class="italic">Labour</span>.<br>
<br>From 1936 to 1939 Ayrton studied painting informally in Vienna and Paris, working briefly under Pavel Tchelitchew, and he attended Heatherley's Art School and various other art schools in London. He travelled to Spain, saw some of the siege of Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War, and spent the summer of 1939 with fellow painters and friends Michael Middleton and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35041/', "John Minton")</script> at Les Baux-de-Provence in France. After the outbreak of war he returned to London, had his first exhibition at the Zwemmer Gallery, and, with Minton, during leave from the RAF, executed the designs for John Gielgud's <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, staged in 1942. Sir Hugh Walpole became an early patron, and, via Sir Kenneth Clark, Ayrton was given a modest job by the War Artists' Advisory Committee. He was invalided out of the RAF in 1942 and shared an exhibition with Minton at the Leicester Galleries in London.<br>
<br>The relationship with Minton was of great intellectual value to both artists and was personally extremely close and intense, but it eventually became difficult, as the homosexual Minton probably fell in love with the heterosexual Ayrton who was unable to reciprocate Minton's feelings. For several years in the 1940s Ayrton shared a house in All Souls Place, London, behind Broadcasting House, with his lover, Joan Walsh (1919&#150;1994), who changed her name by deed poll to Joan Ayrton, and the composer&#150;conductor Constant Lambert, who became a close friend and collaborator. This m&eacute;nage attracted, among others, John Arlott, Margot Fonteyn, Norman Douglas, William Walton, and Dylan Thomas. From 1942 onwards Ayrton's life was marred by ill health, borne with much stoical courage, and his career as an artist developed from a precocity noted by such distinguished elders as Wyndham Lewis (for whom Ayrton acted for some time as visual amanuensis) to a versatile fruition which never brought the honours, the critical acclaim, or the financial success enjoyed by many of his contemporaries.<br>
<br>In this respect, in a country and society which still regards amateurism as a professional advantage, Ayrton suffered from his relentless curiosity, his considerable eclecticism, and his formidable erudition, backed by a strong physical presence which many persons of weaker intellect or personality found intimidating. In fact, his handsome head with long, straight, swept-back hair and full beard, the powerful torso of the sculptor, and the mellifluous voice of a born teacher and conversationalist were compellingly attractive. What left him, at the height of his career, with a single honour&#151;a doctorate from Exeter University (1975)&#151;and no official recognition from the British &#145;art establishment&#146; was the view, commonly held, that his exceptionally varied output was the sign of a jack of all trades. Possibly his lack of critical favour was accentuated by his youthful, undoubtedly intemperate but characteristically closely argued attack on Picasso and the received wisdom which surrounded Picasso's every doodle with adulation. In fairness, while Ayrton never recanted, he did, in two subsequent essays of equal brilliance, ameliorate his earlier views. All three essays&#151;&#145;The master of pastiche&#146; (1944), &#145;A reply to myself&#146; (1956), and &#145;The Midas minotaur&#146; (1969)&#151;are collected in his book <span class="italic">The Rudiments of Paradise</span> (1971).<br>
<br>For more than three decades Ayrton practised as a painter, sculptor, draughtsman, engraver, portraitist, stage designer, book illustrator, novelist, short-story writer, essayist, critic, art historian, radio and television broadcaster, and cinema and television film-maker. While inevitably in an <i>&#339;uvre</i> so prodigious he occasionally let slip work that was not of the first rank, there was in fact none of these trades of which he was not the master.<br>
<br>Ayrton's principal exhibitions, other than regular dealers' selling shows in Britain, Europe, the USA, and Canada, were at Wakefield City Art Gallery (and subsequently on tour) in 1949, the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London in 1955 (a retrospective), the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1963, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa (a regional tour) in 1965, Reading City Art Gallery in 1969, the Bruton Gallery, Bruton, Somerset, in 1971, the University of Sussex, Falmer, in 1972, Portsmouth City Art Gallery (and subsequently on tour) in 1973, and the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in 1973.<br>
<br>The most important exhibition in Ayrton's lifetime, however, was &#145;Word and image&#146;&#151;a remarkably inventive show devoted to a comparison of the work of Ayrton and Wyndham Lewis, showing the interrelationship not only of the two artists and their styles but also of their writings as well as their visual work. This was held in 1971 at the National Book League, London, four years before Ayrton's death. The major retrospective exhibition which he should have had in his lifetime occurred only posthumously in 1977 at the City of Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, and subsequently on tour; in 1981 there was a substantial touring exhibition which visited the Bruton Gallery in Somerset and the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff, among other places. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s a series of small exhibitions in various dealers' galleries and the publication of a definitive biography have in fact enhanced his reputation during a gradual favourable reassessment of the so-called neo-romantics of the 1940s and 1950s. Stylistically he was, in his occasionally spiky, distorted visions, a typical English neo-romantic&#151;sharing a view of both landscape and the human figure with, among others, Minton, Graham Sutherland, Robert MacBryde, and Robert Colquhoun. His sense and use of distortion in and of the human body was most noticeable in his sculpture&#151;particularly in the later work and especially in the minotaurs, who seemed to embody the disproportions and the pain of his own body as it slowly succumbed to progressive bone disease.<br>
<br>Ayrton's visual work, apart from his portraits, tended to be thematic, with certain ideas and images either obsessively recorded or constantly recurring. The discovery of Greek landscape and mythology was to haunt his work until he died. (He travelled extensively in Greece and the areas which were part of the Hellenistic world.) Daedalus and Icarus, Talos, and above all the Minotaur inspired much of his finest work, which ranged from pencil sketches to huge bronzes. For Armand Erpf, a benevolently eccentric American millionaire, he created in 1968 at Arkville in New York state a gigantic maze built of brick and stone, with a 7 foot bronze minotaur and a 7 foot bronze of Daedalus and Icarus in two central chambers.<br>
<br>Ayrton had several, beneficial, obsessions. One, present throughout his working life, was the mechanics of human and animal flight; hence his interests in Icarus, the bones of birds, and related matters. Hector Berlioz preoccupied him for years and inspired sculptures, paintings, a memorable short story, and a remarkable BBC television programme which he devised and narrated. Mirrors also fascinated him and, with their infinite variety of and capacity for reflections, dominated his later sculpture where he mingled bronze, polished metal sheet, and perspex to extraordinary effects. For the two years before his death he had been working on a major BBC television series on the multiple possibilities of mirrors and their imagery in life, art, mathematics, philosophy, and astronomy.<br>
<br>Ayrton's literary output was as varied as his visual work. He was a fine critic (he was art critic of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> from 1944 to 1946) and published books on subjects ranging from <span class="italic">British Drawings</span> (1946) and <span class="italic">Hogarth's Drawings</span> (1948)&#151;via several collections of distinguished essays, notably <span class="italic">Golden Sections</span> (1957) and <span class="italic">The Rudiments of Paradise</span> (1971)&#151;to a pioneering scholarly monograph, <span class="italic">Giovanni Pisano, Sculptor</span> (1969), which had an introduction by Henry Moore.<br>
<br>As a poet Ayrton showed notable talent in the fragmentary <span class="italic">The Testament of Daedalus</span> (1962), which was a foretaste and forerunner of his subsequent novel, <span class="italic">The Maze Maker</span> (1967), and he published posthumously in 1977 <span class="italic">Archilochos</span>, a translation (with the assistance of Professor G. S. Kirk) of the seventh-century <span class="smallcap">BC</span> Greek poet who wrote in the Parian script. This book, containing Ayrton's last published words, was illustrated by his own characteristically spiky etchings done in the last eighteen months of his life.<br>
<br>Ayrton produced one collection of short stories, <span class="italic">Fabrications</span> (1972), influenced by Jorge Luis Borges in the tricks they played with time, history, and memory, but entirely Ayrtonian in their dry wit, originality of imagination, and a wholly beneficent solipsism deriving not from personal vanity but from the indubitable fact that his own experiences, serendipities, and ideas were genuinely of greater creative interest to himself and others than the notions and characters of most other people, Giovanni Pisano and Hector Berlioz excepted. Some of the ideas in <span class="italic">Fabrications</span> sprang from the memories and experiences of Ayrton's maternal grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30509/', "Professor William Ayrton")</script>, an internationally renowned electrical engineer and gold medallist of the Royal Society. (His maternal grandmother, Hertha Ayrton, had herself received the Royal Society's Hughes medal in 1906.)<br>
<br>Ayrton's two novels, <span class="italic">The Maze Maker</span> and <span class="italic">The Midas Consequence</span> (1974), were both an integral part of his visual life. The former, a virtuoso account of the lives of Daedalus and Icarus, deals with mythology, Crete, the minotaur, the excitement of flight, and, above all, the genius of the <i>maker</i>, of the artist as master craftsman. <span class="italic">The Midas Consequence</span> is an equally virtuoso performance, dealing with the joys and pitfalls of being a prolific, omni-talented, and internationally revered modern artist. The hero, Capisco, is obviously&#151;too obviously, for the unwary&#151;based on Picasso. He is, of course, far more than that and he is, in part at least, Ayrton, but ultimately he is the paradigmatic artist and genius, enriched and pampered by society but, in the end, the property and prey of that same society.<br>
<br>Ayrton was a man who travelled widely throughout his life, was blessed by considerable domestic felicity, was a much loved member of the Savile Club, and had a large number of friends. He married, on 28 November 1952, Elisabeth Balchin [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49561/', "Ayrton, Elisabeth Evelyn (1910&#150;1991)")</script>], daughter of the writer Douglas Walshe, who had three daughters from her first marriage, to the writer Nigel Balchin (1908&#150;1970). In the same year he moved with his wife, who was a distinguished authority on English cooking, a superb hostess, and herself a writer, to Bradfields, a beautiful sixteenth-century country house in Essex, formerly the property of the publisher and poet Sir Francis Meynell. Bradfields was Ayrton's principal home, social centre, and studio until his death in 1975. Michael and Elisabeth Ayrton had no children together but Ayrton was a devoted and loving stepfather.<br>
<br>Ayrton was massively industrious and prolific but, without being either self-conscious or boastful about it, divided his life&#151;once he had established home, family, and studio at Bradfields&#151;between work and play. While in the country he worked hard at his multifarious disciplines and then gave over the weekends to highly intellectual house parties with an endless supply of guests, who fed his prodigious appetite for knowledge and whom he entertained with his own dazzling near monologues, while Elisabeth provided sumptuous meals of genuine English <i>haute cuisine</i>. These were based almost entirely on poultry, game, joints of meat, and whole fish, as Ayrton could not abide stews, casseroles, or other dishes in which food was concealed in any way. He had to be able to <i>see</i> what he ate, a minor foible more than compensated for by his genuine craftsman's skill as a carver of meat as well as sculpture; and the sight and sound of Ayrton acting as host to Henry Moore or to George Steiner, for whom he created a magnificent chess set, is not lightly forgotten.<br>
<br>Ayrton was, while most happily married, no respecter of marriage as an institution and had indeed married Elisabeth by removing her from her husband. Immensely attractive to women, he had a considerable number of affairs both before and after his marriage, and he tended, after intense spells of work in the country, to travel alone to London for a few days in pursuit of both the intellectual stimulus of the capital and the pleasures of sexual adventure. It was a mark of his seductive personality and charm that no one much minded the way of life he deemed essential to his creativity. In the last years of his life he suffered increasingly from a highly debilitating form of ankylosing spondylitis which made it difficult for him to walk but did not prevent his sculpting in a sitting position and exploiting an exceptionally powerful torso, not entirely dissimilar to those of his minotaurs. After almost dying from an undiagnosed diabetic neuropathy, he made a virtually complete recovery and was planning a range of new work when, on 16 November 1975, he died of a sudden heart attack in his London flat. He was buried at the parish church at Hadstock, Essex. His wife survived him. Examples of Ayrton's work are to be found in the Tate collection; the National Portrait Gallery and Victoria and Albert Museum, London; the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; the Reading Museum and Art Gallery; the Portsmouth City Museum and Art Gallery; and the City Art Gallery, Southampton.<br>
