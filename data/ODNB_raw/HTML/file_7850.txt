<span class="headword">Doudney,  David Alfred</span>  (1811&#150;1893), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and educationist</span>, was born on 8 March 1811 at 386 Mile End Terrace, Portsea, son of John Doudney (<i>d</i>. 1834), tallow chandler, and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1838). Details of his education are unknown, but it was probably minimal. At the age of thirteen he was apprenticed to a printer at Southampton, and subsequently joined the staff of the <span class="italic">Hampshire Advertiser</span>. In 1832 he moved to London and was engaged by Messrs Jowett and Mills, printers, of Bolt Court, Fleet Street. He set up a printing business of his own in 1835, first at Holloway, and then in Long Lane, Aldersgate Street.<br>
<br>In 1840 Doudney purchased and became editor of the sternly Calvinist <span class="italic">Gospel Magazine</span>, which he edited for many years. He married, first, in 1834, a Miss Draper. They had three children, of whom only the eldest son, D. A. Doudney, survived. In 1842 he married Eliza (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1873), daughter of William Durkin, at St Mary's, Portsea. Of their eight children, five died young. In 1846 he retired from the printing trade, and in November of that year he went to Ireland to distribute funds raised by his readers for the relief of the Irish famine. At this time he felt called to full-time Christian ministry, and underwent some training in Ireland. He was ordained in 1847 by the bishop of Cashel as a licentiate clergyman. From 1847 to 1854 Doudney was curate of Monksland, co. Waterford. Moved by the poverty and lack of facilities he found Doudney established industrial and agricultural schools at nearby Bunmahon. Here he set up a printing press, which produced his new periodical, <span class="italic">Old Jonathan</span>. An abridgement of John Gill's exposition of the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New</span> testaments, which appeared in six volumes between 1852 and 1854, was also printed. The latter venture gained Doudney recognition. The lord lieutenant, the earl of Carlisle, presented him to the sinecure living of Kilcash, near Clonmel, in 1854, enabling Doudney to continue his active and highly individual work.<br>
<br>Doudney left Ireland in 1859 to become perpetual curate of St Luke's, Bedminster, Bristol, where again he established industrial schools. He continued to edit the <span class="italic">Gospel Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">Old Jonathan</span>, and published a large number of tracts and other devotional works. Doudney also took an active part in many charitable institutions, particularly the Printers' Corporation. He retired from St Luke's in 1890, moving to Southville, Granada Road, Southsea, where he died on 21 April 1893. He was buried at Highland Road cemetery, East Southsea, on 25 April. He married a third time in old age and had two children, who predeceased him. He left four sons and two daughters.<br>
