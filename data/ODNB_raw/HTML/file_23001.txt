<span class="headword">Rae, Sir  David</span>, first baronet, Lord Eskgrove  (1729&#150;1804), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the son of David Rae of St Andrews, an Episcopalian minister, and his wife, Agnes, daughter of Sir David Forbes, bt, of Newhall. He was educated at Haddington grammar school and at Edinburgh University, where he attended the law lectures of Professor John Erskine (1695&#150;1768). He was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates on 11 December 1751, and quickly acquired a considerable practice. In 1753 he was retained in an appeal to the House of Lords, which took him to London, where he became acquainted with Lord Hardwicke and his son Charles Yorke.<br>
<br>Rae was appointed one of the commissioners for collecting evidence in the lengthy Douglas cause which established Archibald James Edward Stewart as the true son of Lady Jane Douglas and thus heir to the Douglas estates. In that capacity he accompanied James Burnett (afterwards Lord Monboddo) to France in September 1764. He was the leading advocate in the Scottish court of exchequer for many years. He succeeded Alexander Boswell, Lord Auchinleck, as an ordinary lord of session on 14 November 1782, taking the title Lord Eskgrove, from a small estate which he possessed near Inveresk. On 20 April 1785 he was appointed a lord of justiciary.<br>
<br>Among his famous cases, Eskgrove tried William Brodie (<i>d</i>. 1788) for robbing the general excise office in August 1788, the Revd Thomas Fyshe Palmer for seditious practices in September 1793, William Skirving and Maurice Margarot for sedition in January 1794, Joseph Gerrald for sedition in March 1794, and Robert Watt and David Downie for high treason in September 1794. He was promoted to the post of lord justice clerk on 1 June 1799, and was created a baronet on 27 June 1804.<br>
<br>Henry Cockburn declared of Eskgrove that &#145;never once did he do or say anything which had the slightest claim to be remembered for any intrinsic merit. The value of all his words and actions consisted in their absurdity&#146;, adding:<blockquote>in the trial of Glengarry for murder in a duel, a lady of great beauty was called as a witness. She came into court veiled; but, before administering the oath, Eskgrove gave her this exposition of her duty: &#145;Young woman! you will now consider yourself as in the presence of Almighty God and of this High Court. Lift up your veil; throw off all modesty, and look me in the face&#146;. (<span class="italic">Memorials &hellip; by Henry Cockburn</span>, 118&#150;19, 122)</blockquote>But in spite of his ludicrous appearance and his many eccentricities of manner, Eskgrove was a man of the greatest integrity, and one of the ablest Scottish lawyers of the day. He collaborated in publishing <span class="italic">Decisions of the Court of Session from the End of the Year 1756 to the End of the Year 1760</span> (1765).<br>
<br>For many years Eskgrove lived in a house in the Old Assembly Close, and afterwards at St John Street, Canongate, Edinburgh. From his marriage on 14 October 1761 to Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1770), youngest daughter of Dugald Stuart of Blairhall, Perthshire, there were two sons: David (<i>d</i>. 1815), who succeeded as the second baronet, but as he had no sons the baronetcy passed to his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23005/', "William Rae (1769&#150;1842)")</script>. There was also one daughter, Margaret, who married, on 3 January 1804, Captain Thomas Phipps Howard of the 23rd light dragoons. Eskgrove died at Eskgrove on 23 October 1804, and was buried in Inveresk churchyard.<br>
