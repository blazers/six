<span class="headword">Benson,  Edward Frederic</span>  (1867&#150;1940), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born at Wellington College on 24 July 1867. He was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2139/', "Edward White Benson (1829&#150;1896)")</script>, headmaster of Wellington College and subsequently archbishop of Canterbury, and his wife, Mary Sidgwick (1841&#150;1918). He was a younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30712/', "Arthur Christopher Benson (1862&#150;1925)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56097/', "Mary Eleanor Benson (1863&#150;1890)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56291/', "Margaret Benson (1865&#150;1916)")</script>, and an elder brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30718/', "Robert Hugh Benson (1871&#150;1914)")</script>. He was educated at Temple Grove School, Sheen, at Marlborough College, and at King's College, Cambridge, where he was exhibitioner (1888) and scholar (1890), and secured first classes in both parts of the classical tripos (1890, 1891). His first book, <span class="italic">Sketches from Marlborough</span>, was published while he was at Cambridge.<br>
<br>Benson worked in Athens for the British School of Archaeology (1892&#150;5) and in Egypt for the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies (1895). His first novel, <span class="italic">Dodo</span>, was published in 1893 and was a runaway success. From 1895 to 1918 he lived in London and devoted himself to writing, much of his work being published in fashionable magazines. From 1918 he lived for the greater part of each year at Lamb House, Rye, Sussex, which had been the home of Henry James.<br>
<br>Benson described himself as uncontrollably prolific: he published at least ninety-three books, excluding collaborations. Benson's writings fall into three groups: novels of social satire, reminiscences, and horror stories. Most famous among his social satires are the novels of manners, especially the &#145;Mapp and Lucia&#146; novels, which include <span class="italic">Queen Lucia</span> (1920), <span class="italic">Lucia in London</span> (1927), and <span class="italic">Miss Mapp</span> (1922); they are set both in London and in &#145;Tilling&#146;, a fictionalized Rye, and are said to be <i>romans-&agrave;-clef</i> (as also are the <span class="italic">Dodo</span> novels, where Dodo is believed to be a portrait of Margot Tennant, later Lady Oxford). These novels remain witty and penetrating social studies. A London Weekend Television dramatization, entitled <span class="italic">Mapp and Lucia</span>, was screened by Channel 4. This, along with an omnibus publication of the complete novels, <span class="italic">Make Way for Lucia</span> (1977; 1986), revived interest in Benson's work, and increased his popularity with a wider audience. Another group of his social satires deals with university life, examples being, <span class="italic">The Babe, BA</span> (1897), <span class="italic">David Blaize</span> (1916), and <span class="italic">Colin II</span> (1925); these novels are less successful.<br>
<br>Benson's books of reminiscences, such as <span class="italic">As we were</span> (1930), <span class="italic">As we are</span> (1932), and <span class="italic">Final Edition</span> (1940), have value as sources for social history and personal anecdote, as he excelled in creating vivid pictures of the atmosphere of the times, and this was a quality also displayed in his biographical studies of Edward VII and Queen Victoria. In one of his books of family recollections Benson claims for himself a retentive, observational memory, even of things hardly noted at the time; and this was perhaps his most remarkable quality, displayed in his non-fiction and fiction alike. His stories of horror and the supernatural have remained consistently popular. Early horror novels, such as <span class="italic">The Luck of the Vails</span> (1901), and <span class="italic">The Room in the Tower</span> (1912), are characterized by lavish descriptions and psychological tension. <span class="italic">Visible and Invisible</span> (1923), <span class="italic">Spook Stories</span> (1928), and <span class="italic">More Spook Stories</span> (1934) are more coldly unemotional excursions into the realm of ghosts and marvels.<br>
<br>Benson never married and many of his novels suggest that he had a generalized dislike of women. He lived alone in Rye and continued writing until his death. He was mayor of Rye from 1934 to 1937 and a JP. He was elected an honorary fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge, in 1938 and was appointed OBE. He died in University College Hospital, London, on 29 February 1940, and was buried in the Rye cemetery after a funeral conducted by the bishop of Chichester. The E. F. Benson Society was founded in London in 1984, and publishes a journal, <span class="italic">The Dodo</span>, semi-annually.<br>
