<span class="headword">Prasad, Rajendra</span>  (1884&#150;1963), <span class="occ">president of India</span>, was born at Zeradei, a village in the Saran district of Bihar, on 3 December 1884, the youngest son of Mahadev Sahai, who owned a small <i>zamindari</i> (landed estate) and practised Indian medicine. Prasad learned Persian at home and then joined first the district school at Chapra and then a private school at Patna. In 1897 he married Rajbansi Devi; they had two sons.<br>
<br>Gaining a scholarship, in 1902 Prasad moved to Presidency College in Calcutta, graduated in 1906, and went on to take an MA degree in English literature. After teaching for a year at a college in Muzaffarpur he returned to Calcutta to take a degree in law and set up a legal practice in 1911. He also taught at the law college.<br>
<br>Living in Calcutta, Prasad was influenced by the agitation from 1905 over the partition of Bengal; and in 1911 he joined the Indian National Congress. But his interests were mainly in his home province. In 1913 he presided over the Bihar students' conference in Monghyr and the next year was active in flood relief operations. In 1916 he shifted his legal practice to Patna, where a high court had been set up. The next year he came into contact with Mahatma Gandhi, who had interested himself in the agitation of the workers in the indigo plantations at Champaran; this marked a turning point in Prasad's life. In 1920 he joined Gandhi's non-co-operation movement and gave up his legal practice. As the movement required the boycott of educational institutions managed or subsidized by the government, Prasad established a National College at Patna and was its first principal. He also started <span class="italic">Desh</span> (&#145;Nation&#146;), a Hindi newspaper.<br>
<br>In 1924 Prasad served as chairman of the Patna municipal committee; but his primary concerns in the twenties were the promotion of <i>khaddar</i> (handspun cotton) and the propagation of Hindi to replace English as the all-India language. In 1928 he visited Britain to assist an old client whose case came up before the privy council, and thereafter travelled in Europe. At an anti-war conference in Graz, Austria, he was beaten up by right-wing elements.<br>
<br>In 1930 the Congress again engaged in a civil disobedience campaign led by Gandhi; Prasad was arrested in July and served a sentence of six months in Hazaribagh gaol. He was in the same prison again from January to July 1932, and from January 1933 to 15 January 1934. On the day of his release there was a massive earthquake in Bihar, followed by floods. Prasad's organization of relief operations brought him to national attention. He was elected president of the Congress for the annual session at Bombay in October.<br>
<br>For the next few years Prasad was at the centre of policy making in the Congress. He was regarded as an unquestioning follower of Gandhi, a leader of the right-wing group in Congress and the man acceptable to all sides in compromise settlements. In April 1939 he was re-elected president of the Congress in the crisis caused by the resignation of Subhas Chandra Bose following differences with Gandhi, and served in that capacity until March 1940.<br>
<br>In August 1942 Prasad, being a member of the Congress working committee which was outlawed by the government at the start of the Quit India campaign, was arrested and detained in Bankipore gaol until June 1945. From his early youth a sufferer from asthma, his poor health did not permit his joining the other members of the working committee in detention in Ahmednagar Fort, and the conditions under which he was detained were less stringent. In gaol he wrote in Hindi a book on the possible consequences of a partition of the country, later translated and published in English as <span class="italic">India Divided</span> (1946), and completed his autobiography, which he had begun in the early forties.<br>
<br>After his release Prasad was a Congress participant in the negotiations with the British government. In September 1946, when the Congress decided to join the interim government, he took charge of the food and agriculture portfolio. He was also, on 11 December 1946, elected president of the newly formed constituent assembly. But he left the government in December 1947 again to become president of the Congress, when the party was riven by a dispute between the organizational and governmental wings.<br>
<br>On 26 January 1950, when India became a republic, Prasad was elected president of the republic, and was re-elected in 1952 and 1957. But on each occasion he was elected by a majority in the Congress Party against the wishes of the prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Prasad was a conservative Hindu conformist out of tune with the secular socialist views of Nehru. In consequence, relations between the president and the government were not happy. Prasad did not reconcile himself to the opinion of legal experts that he was bound to accept ministerial advice in all cases. He was particularly opposed to changes in Hindu personal law granting women the rights of divorce and inheritance; and in 1951 Nehru prevailed only by threatening resignation.<br>
<br>Prasad was tall, well-built, muscular, and of a dark complexion. He at no time enjoyed good health and in 1961 was seriously ill. After retirement in 1962 he returned to Patna and died there at the Sadaqat <i>ashram</i> on 23 February 1963.<br>
