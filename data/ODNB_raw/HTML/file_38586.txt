<span class="headword">D'Arcy,  Constance Eleanor Mary  Byrne</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Ella D'Arcy]</span>  (1857?&#150;1937), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in Pimlico, London, one of the nine children of Anthony Byrne D'Arcy (1826&#150;1873), corn factor and maltster, and his wife, Sophia Anne (1833&#150;1891), daughter of John Matthews, town clerk of Gravesend, Kent. Her father's family home was Drummartin Castle, near Dublin, and she had a private income from the estate. Educated at a convent in Clapham and abroad, she studied fine art between 1875 and 1877 at the Slade School of Art, London. Relinquishing art, because, it was said, of poor eyesight, she turned to short-story writing. Her early work, some of it under the pseudonym Gilbert H. Page, was published in <span class="italic">Argosy</span>, <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span>, <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>, and <span class="italic">Temple Bar</span>.<br>
<br>Greater recognition came when &#145;Irremediable&#146; appeared in the first issue of the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span>. Ella D'Arcy acted, at least in an unofficial capacity, as an assistant to the quarterly's founder and editor, Henry Harland (1861&#150;1905), and was a frequent guest at his soir&eacute;es. She had more work published in the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span> than any writer other than Harland himself. Her stories regularly explore bleak lives, brittle and emancipated women, and the misery of marriage to a designing, selfish, or stupid partner, such as Esther in &#145;Irremediable&#146;, who &#145;evinced all the self-satisfaction of an illiterate mind&#146;. Other stories, including &#145;The Death Mask&#146; and &#145;At the Villa Lucienne&#146;, are evocations of horror and fear, or, like &#145;The Web of Maya&#146;, of the psychology of the obsessed. A group of stories set in the Channel Islands contrasts peasant superstition with a heartless sophistication among the landed class. Although she was regarded as &#145;a distinctive voice in fin-de-si&egrave;cle literature&#146;  (Orel, 255), and the &#145;most astringent writer of her sex in the 'nineties&#146;  (Stanford, 63), Ella D'Arcy's output was modest: she was given to polishing and repolishing her work and was regarded by a contemporary, N. Syrett, as the laziest woman she had ever met. Her first collection of short stories, <span class="italic">Monochromes</span>, was published in John Lane's <span class="roman">Keynotes series</span> in 1895. <span class="italic">Modern Instances</span> followed in 1898, also the year of publication of her sole novel, <span class="italic">The Bishop's Dilemma</span>, the tale of a weak priest who has a wishy-washy love affair and takes to drink.<br>
<br>Quickened interest in the latter part of the twentieth century in the writers and artists of the 1890s has focused in the case of Ella D'Arcy on the French influence on her work (especially that of Maupassant), and on the short story as a vehicle for the expression of cynicism, discontinuity, and isolation. Her realism has also been analysed, with its depiction of a broader cross-section of society including its failures, its willingness to embrace taboo subjects, and its readiness to detail the commonplace. The quality of her descriptions has also been admired, many of them having a visual appeal held to derive from her training as an artist. In her interest in the supernatural and in the folklore of the Channel Islands, Ella D'Arcy has been held to foreshadow the work of Elizabeth Goudge, Sheila Kaye-Smith, John Ferguson, C. Northcote Parkinson, and G. B. Edwards.<br>
<br>Ella D'Arcy was short in stature, with ginger hair, small greenish eyes, and a large upper lip. Her love of travel and habit of losing touch with her friends for months before turning up unannounced earned her the nickname of Goblin Ella. Frederick Rolfe described her as a &#145;mouse-mannered piece of sex&#146;  (Rolfe, 31), while Constance Smedley, who had failed to persuade her to join a literary coterie, found her &#145;entirely sincere and unsentimental&#146;  (Smedley, 46). She had a zest for life, was amusing and witty, keenly interested in genealogy, sharp and penetrating in her judgements, and with decided views on most subjects. Ella D'Arcy's last years were spent in Paris, where she lived in a single room in the rue Jacob, but she was brought to England in 1937 after a stroke and died in a London hospital on 5 September 1937. She was buried in the Roman Catholic section of the Brookwood cemetery. She is best-known for her short stories, and for her translation into English of Andr&eacute; Maurois's <span class="italic">Ariel</span> (1924), a biography of Shelley.<br>
