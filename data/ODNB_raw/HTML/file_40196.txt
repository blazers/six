<span class="headword">Millar,  Frederick Robert Hoyer</span>, first Baron Inchyra  (1900&#150;1989), <span class="occ">diplomatist and civil servant</span>, was born on 6 June 1900 in Montrose, the third son and youngest of three children of Robert Hoyer Millar, timber merchant, of Blair Castle, Culross, Perthshire, and his wife, Alice Anne Combe, daughter of Dr James Simson. Frederick (known as Derick) was educated at Wellington College and New College, Oxford, where he took a second-class honours degree in modern history in 1922 and an MA in 1954 on his election as an honorary fellow of the college. He played rugby for the university without, however, getting a blue.<br>
<br>In 1922 Millar was an honorary attach&eacute; at the British embassy in Brussels. In the following year he entered the diplomatic service as a third secretary, first at Berlin and then in Paris. He returned to the Foreign Office in 1928 and moved to Cairo as second secretary in 1930.<br>
<br>In 1931 Millar married (Anna Judith) Elizabeth (known as Bunchie), daughter of Reneke de Marees van Swinderen, the Netherlands minister in London, and his American wife. Bunchie was a strong and attractive character and a great help to her husband in his career. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Millar returned to London in 1934 as assistant private secretary to the secretary of state and, since there was then no personnel department, was responsible for dealing with all appointments in the Foreign Office and diplomatic service. Millar managed this task with sympathy and skill. His judgement of men and events was eminently sound.<br>
<br>In 1939 Millar went to Washington as a first secretary and head of Chancery. It was a critical time. Both the ambassador and his minister were Christian Scientists and, during the final illness of the ambassador, the eleventh marquess of Lothian, Millar was in a difficult position. He also had to deal with the rapid build-up of the British departmental and military representation in Washington and the initial problems of the ambassadorship of the first earl of Halifax. He became counsellor in 1941 and was secretary of the British civil secretariat in Washington in 1943&#150;4. His administrative skills and his Washington connections served him in good stead in this testing period.<br>
<br>In 1944 Millar became counsellor and in 1947 assistant under-secretary in the Foreign Office. He returned to Washington as minister in 1948. He played an important part in the establishment and early years of NATO, becoming in 1950 its UK deputy and in 1952 the permanent representative on the NATO council. In 1953 he was appointed UK high commissioner in Germany, where he had an influential role during the transition from allied control to diplomatic recognition, and in 1955 he became the first post-war ambassador at Bonn.<br>
<br>An excellent administrator and effective operator in the foreign service, in 1957 Millar returned to the Foreign Office as permanent under-secretary of state and head of the diplomatic service, at a time when the foreign service had been badly shaken and divided by the Suez crisis. His robust but sympathetic manner and his administrative ability soon restored morale and made him an outstanding and popular head of the service. He retired in 1961, when he was created a hereditary peer as Baron Inchyra. He took his title from Inchyra House, his Perthshire home, and sat on the cross-benches. He was king-at-arms of the Order of St Michael and St George, and became a member of the queen's bodyguard for Scotland. He was also a governor of Wellington College for many years.<br>
<br>On his retirement from the foreign service Inchyra accepted a number of appointments in banking, finance, industry, and insurance. He was also chairman of the British Red Cross and of the Anglo-Netherlands Society in London. In between these activities and in his final retirement he energetically pursued his favourite sport of shooting. He was appointed CVO (1938), CMG (1939), KCMG (1949), and GCMG (1956).<br>
<br>In appearance Inchyra was very tall and rather portly with a florid complexion and a bald head. He generally moved slowly in a dignified manner. He was a good companion, and had been a popular figure in Oxford and a member of the Bullingdon Club. In April 1989 he was incapacitated by a massive stroke, but lingered on until he died at the Royal Infirmary, Perth, on 16 October 1989. He was succeeded in the barony by his elder son, Robert Charles Reneke Hoyer Millar (<i>b</i>. 1935).<br>
