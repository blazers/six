<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cornwallis, Sir  William</span>  (1744&#150;1819), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Eye, Suffolk, on 20 February 1744, the fourth son of Charles, fifth Baron and first Earl Cornwallis (1700&#150;1762), a royal household official, and his wife, the Hon. Elizabeth Townshend (<i>d</i>. 1785), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27617/', "Charles Townshend, second Viscount Townshend")</script>. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6338/', "Charles Cornwallis (1738&#150;1805)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6341/', "James Cornwallis (1743&#150;1824)")</script> were his elder brothers. He entered Eton College in 1753 and joined the navy in 1755, under the patronage of the duke of Newcastle.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Cornwallis's first ship, the <i>Newark</i>, went to North America under Admiral Edward Boscawen to intercept a French reinforcement for Canada; she was present at the capture of Louisbourg in 1758, and at the battle of Quiberon Bay. Shortly afterwards Cornwallis went to the Mediterranean. In December 1760 Cornwallis moved into the flagship of Admiral Charles Saunders, and on 5 April 1761 he was appointed lieutenant. After the death of his father in June 1762 and the retirement of his father's patron Newcastle, Cornwallis's mother and eldest brother, Charles (now second Earl Cornwallis), expressed some anxiety about his career, but he was able to secure peacetime employment through his ability, presence of mind under fire, and family interest. In July 1764 he was promoted commander, and on 20 April 1765 he was made captain by the new Rockingham ministry, which his brother supported. Cornwallis was an early convert to the divisional system whereby each lieutenant took charge of a division of the ship's company, which he introduced aboard his first captain's command. Cornwallis knew the value of his political friends and family, all of whom were whigs. In 1768 he was returned as MP for the local family constituency of Eye in Suffolk, a seat he retained until 1774. In 1784 Lord Howe (at that time first lord of the Admiralty) persuaded him to stand as the government candidate at Portsmouth. In 1790, after Howe left the Admiralty, Cornwallis returned to Eye, and he remained in parliament until January 1807.<br>
<br>Cornwallis was appointed to the <i>Pallas</i> in 1774, and, operating on the west African coast, he arrested several rebel American vessels, which were loading gunpowder in the African rivers. In 1776 he moved to the West Indies and North American stations, before going home. Moving to the <i>Lion</i> (64 guns) in August 1778 Cornwallis returned to the West Indies in time to take part in the battle of Grenada on 6 July 1779. The <i>Lion</i>, in the van, suffered severely, being effectively dismasted, but Cornwallis managed to spread some sails on the stumps of his masts and limp to Jamaica. While the <i>Lion</i> was refitting Cornwallis met Horatio Nelson. A shared commitment to the highest professional standards, and a dynamic approach to tactical problems cemented a warm personal relationship that would last until Nelson's death. The following March Cornwallis commanded a small squadron cruising in the Windward passage. Off Monte Christi he encountered a French convoy escorted by a more powerful squadron, which attacked him on 21 March. Although heavily outnumbered Cornwallis kept up a running fight throughout the day, until reinforcements arrived the following morning and the French broke off. At the end of the year Cornwallis returned to England, with Nelson, more dead than alive after the Nicaragua expedition, as a passenger. In the spring the <i>Lion</i> joined Admiral George Darby's fleet for the second relief of Gibraltar.<h2>
<a name="LatercareerandCornwallissretreat"></a>Later career and &#145;Cornwallis's retreat&#146;</h2>In August 1781 Cornwallis took the <i>Canada</i> (74 guns) to North America. The attempt to relieve his brother at Yorktown proving futile, the <i>Canada</i> was detached to Admiral Samuel Hood in the West Indies. Cornwallis took a prominent part in the three major battles of 1782: St Kitts on 26 January, and the battles off Dominica on 9 and 12 April. On 12 April, in the Saints passage, Admiral George Rodney caught de Grasse with his fleet badly formed, exploited a shift in the wind to break through his line, and imposed close action. Although he took the enemy flagship, Rodney's hesitant conduct of the latter stages of the battle, when he restrained Cornwallis from pursuing a broken, fleeing enemy, excited the derision of a young whig captain, already predisposed to find fault with a tory officer. The <i>Canada</i> returned home that autumn, and with Cornwallis's high reputation, and his political friends in office, he was appointed to the yacht <i>Royal Charlotte</i> in March 1783, an honorary command he held until October 1787. In September 1787 he was appointed colonel of marines. When his brother Earl Cornwallis was appointed governor-general of Bengal, Cornwallis was sent out as commodore and commander-in-chief in the East Indies in October 1788; and when the French Revolutionary War broke out Cornwallis seized all the French ships within reach, and helped capture the French trading posts at Chandernagore and Pondicherry. He reached England in April 1794.<br>
<br>After his promotion to rear-admiral on 1 February 1793 Cornwallis hoisted his flag in the Channel Fleet in May 1794. He missed the battle of 1 June 1794 because he was escorting a convoy. On 4 July he became a vice-admiral, and in December he moved to the new three-decker <i>Royal Sovereign</i> (100 guns). On 16 June 1795 Cornwallis was cruising off Ushant with his flagship, four battleships, and two frigates when a powerful French force of nine battleships and nine frigates under Vice-Admiral Villaret-Joyeuse came into contact early. Cornwallis hauled off and formed a line ahead. The French closed, two of the British ships sailing badly. At daylight on 17 June the French were closing in three divisions, one directly astern and one on each quarter. At 9 a.m. two French ships opened fire, damaging the rigging of the <i>Mars</i>. Seeing she was falling to leeward and might be cut off, Cornwallis wore round to support her in his flagship, and ran down to engage the enemy. This bold move caused four French ships steering to attack the <i>Mars</i> to pause, enabling her to regain the line of battle. Desultory firing continued until 6 p.m. Shortly after 6.30 the French ships shortened sail and made off to the east, victims of a classic <i>ruse de guerre</i>. Cornwallis had detached the frigate <i>Phaeton</i> (Captain Robert Stopford), who pretended he was in communication with the main British fleet. &#145;Cornwallis's retreat&#146; was a monument to his resolve and his skill. In October Cornwallis joined an admiral's revolt, protesting against new regulations which removed soldiers serving on warships from naval discipline. This strained relations with the first lord, Earl Spencer. Cornwallis was ordered to take command of the West Indies fleet and proceed with the army transports in February 1796. When the <i>Royal Sovereign</i> was damaged in a collision, Cornwallis, having seen his fleet safely into the Atlantic, returned to Spithead. The Admiralty ordered him to proceed in a frigate. Although willing to proceed as soon as the <i>Royal Sovereign</i> was repaired, he declined to go in a frigate, his health being precarious. He was court-martialled for disobedience, and although censured for not proceeding in a ship of the original squadron, he was acquitted. Cornwallis struck his flag and had no more service while Spencer remained at the Admiralty. On 14 February 1799 he became a full admiral, and bought a country seat, Newlands, near Milford in Hampshire.<h2>
<a name="BlockadeofBrest"></a>Blockade of Brest</h2>In February 1801 Earl St Vincent became first lord, and selected Cornwallis to replace him in command of the Channel Fleet. The <i>Ville de Paris</i> (110 guns), the largest ship in the service, would carry his flag, with little interruption, for the next five years. St Vincent had already drilled the Channel Fleet to the highest standards of seamanship and initiative, but Cornwallis's blockade of Brest was a masterpiece of naval operational art in the age of sail. Denying the French access to stores and supplies exhausted the large Franco-Spanish fleet, while effective British victualling arrangements ensured that the only limits on his fleet were seamanship and human endurance, qualities that Cornwallis possessed in abundance. This was vital, for the collapse of the second coalition left Britain once again single-handedly fighting France. The blockade of Brest was the hub around which British strategy revolved, covering operations in the Baltic and Mediterranean, protecting shipping, and preventing an invasion. At the peace of Amiens Cornwallis came ashore briefly, but St Vincent reappointed him to the channel command before war resumed, and he was on station off Ushant on 17 May 1803, the day before war was declared. The command wore out even the best officers, and Cornwallis went ashore twice for his health, being relieved by Sir Charles Cotton in July and August 1804, and Lord Gardner between April and July 1805. Cornwallis was now sixty, of medium height, and rather stout with a florid complexion.<br>
<br>In the early stages of the blockade St Vincent and Cornwallis were eager to take the initiative, and considered a combined attack on Brest; but there were never enough troops. Cornwallis hoped to attack the fleet in Brest Roads with fireships, but this plan was blocked by Admiral Gambier, the petty and spiteful first sea lord who made the last eighteen months of Cornwallis's sea career a severe trial of his less than perfect patience.<br>
<br>When William Pitt returned to office in May 1804, Henry Dundas, Lord Melville, replaced St Vincent. Melville was soon afterwards succeeded by Admiral Lord Barham, who provided the central direction of the 1805 campaign, but left his commanders to use their initiative on the basis of the available intelligence. Throughout 1805 Napoleon's plans were constantly shifting to meet each new set of circumstances, and may have had more to do with disguising his intention of attacking Austria, and pinning down the British, than invading the British Isles. In early 1805 he planned a grand raid on the British West Indies. This and all subsequent schemes collapsed in the face of coherent British strategic and tactical doctrine, superior British leadership, and his own ignorance of the peculiar problems of war at sea. The major French movement of 1805, Villeneuve's cruise to the West Indies, planned as an attack on trade and colonies, only belatedly became part of an invasion scheme. When Barham divined that Villeneuve was not returning to the Mediterranean he directed Cornwallis to detach Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Calder to pick up the ships blockading Rochfort and Lorient and intercept Villeneuve off Cape Finisterre (Spain). In mid-July Cornwallis stretched to the south to search for Villeneuve, leaving Brest with only a frigate screen for eight days; he had correctly calculated that Admiral Ganteaume would not come out. He did not make contact with Villeneuve, and returned to his post depressed, having once again missed the chance of a battle. On 13 August Calder rejoined the flag, after his inconclusive battle with Villeneuve on 22 July. Nelson, returning from the West Indies, fell in with him on 15 August, and left his squadron with Cornwallis. Cornwallis now commanded thirty-six battleships. The centre was safe, but there were no British battleships in the Mediterranean, and precious few south of Brest. Although Cornwallis's main task was to hold the mouth of the channel, to prevent an invasion of Britain or Ireland, he recognized that French fleets could now control the Mediterranean, which had been abandoned by Nelson, or cruise against British trade.<br>
<br>Cornwallis had to balance these conflicting priorities, and in this crisis he demonstrated his true worth as a strategist of genius. Cornwallis was convinced that Villeneuve, with at least twenty-five sail, was either at Ferrol or already moving south. While Allemand's small Rochefort squadron was supposed to have joined Villeneuve, if it had not it would pose a serious threat to trade. Something had to be done. The initial concentration at the centre had been correct, but with Ganteaume held inside Brest, and morally already beaten, it was time to take the initiative. This led to the most controversial decision of Cornwallis's career. On 16 August, the day after Nelson had reinforced him, Cornwallis divided his fleet. He sent half his ships, under Calder, to Ferrol, to blockade Villeneuve, or to pursue him if he left. Calder had twenty battleships. Barham, who had anticipated the movement, was quick to approve. In fact Cornwallis had not divided his fleet quite as much as mere numbers would suggest. The seventeen ships remaining with his flag included ten three-deckers, including the three most powerful ships in the navy. Against this Villeneuve had twenty-nine ships, but only one three-decker. The relative effectiveness of the two fleets ensured that Cornwallis, as St Vincent had recognized, would not be beaten by any number of French and Spanish ships. Even Ganteaume in Brest only had three three-deckers. Consequently the risk in dividing the Channel Fleet was small, and the prize to be secured was vast. The fleet that Cornwallis detached under Calder was the one that Nelson led at Trafalgar. Had it not been sent Villeneuve would have been able to operate against trade, as Barham feared, return to Toulon, or go to Sicily as Napoleon desired. Between 1803 and 1805 British strategy had been complicated by the sheer number of French and Spanish battleships. Now they were at sea they could be destroyed.<br>
<br>Throughout the campaign Cornwallis knew that every other squadron would, in an emergency, fall back on him. He was also in possession of superior intelligence of French movements. Consequently he knew that if Villeneuve came north to Brest, Calder would be hot on his heels. This understanding proved critical when Ganteaume finally tried to leave Brest on 21 August, following peremptory orders from Napoleon. He had twenty-one battleships, Cornwallis had seventeen. At 4.30 the following morning Cornwallis led the fleet towards the French in a single line. The French made sail, but when the British closed, they went about and ran for the harbour under the cover of heavy shore batteries. Cornwallis tried to cut off a flagship at the rear of the French line, but Ganteaume scrambled back. Cornwallis was slightly wounded by a shell fragment. Once again he had demonstrated exemplary skill. His aggression, based on well-founded confidence, was tempered by a cool head, and informed by strategic wisdom. Although Cornwallis would have preferred to let Ganteaume out to sea, where he could be destroyed, the strategic situation required that he be driven back into harbour. Cornwallis's greatness lay in his ability to see the big picture, and adapt his tactics accordingly. He had to be content with a partial action, the moral significance of which was as great as any fleet battle. Recognizing there was now no danger of an invasion, Cornwallis quickly instructed Calder to pursue Villeneuve if he left Ferrol, and warned Collingwood to expect him off Cadiz.<br>
<br>The position off Brest was complicated by the extended cruise of Allemand's squadron, which was sufficiently powerful to overwhelm any of the extremely valuable commercial and military convoys then on passage. Cornwallis detached five battleships in early September, and at the end of the month took the entire fleet in pursuit, but Allemand's luck held. The Channel Fleet was back off Ushant on 8 October. Within days Barham reported Napoleon's invasion of Germany; the crisis of the naval war had passed. After Trafalgar Cornwallis regretted that he had not been able to speak with Nelson that summer. Cornwallis's inshore division, under Sir Richard Strachan, searching for Allemand, captured the last fugitives from Trafalgar, but Allemand got home, unscathed, on Christmas eve 1805. After Trafalgar the Channel Fleet was divided to meet Barham's overriding concern for the defence of trade. When the blockade was relaxed for the winter, to reduce the damage to the fleet, two French battle squadrons escaped from Brest. They achieved nothing; one was destroyed off San Domingo in January, the other suffered severely from the weather.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsandreputation"></a>Final years and reputation</h2>Deeply affected by the death of Nelson, exhausted in mind and body, and convinced there would be no more fleet actions, Cornwallis became paranoid. The &#145;ministry of all the talents&#146; replaced him with St Vincent and he hauled down his flag on 22 February 1806. The death of his brother Charles in 1805, followed by that of his flag captain, John Whitby, on 6 April 1806, ended Cornwallis's earthly ambitions. He saw no further service, and effectively retired from public life, giving up his seat in parliament in early 1807. He spent his remaining years at home, with his horses and parrots, latterly in the company of Whitby's widow. He had never married, had few close friends, and little interest in society. At the peace he was made GCB. He died on 5 July 1819, at Newlands, near Milford, Hampshire, leaving his estate to Mrs Whitby. He was buried in Milford churchyard, alongside Captain Whitby, in an unmarked grave.<br>
<br>Cornwallis lacked the polish and refined manners of his elder brother, preferred the company of other naval men, and considered outward show to be vulgar. He was devoted to the Church of England, and loathed blood sports. Universally admired and respected by his officers, and loved by the sailors, his nicknames were complimentary. The sailors called him Billy Blue, from his constant use of the Blue Peter to keep the fleet at short notice when anchored in Torbay, and Billy-go-tight in mocking tribute to his relative abstemiousness and florid complexion. His fellow admirals used Billy. Given to depression and ill humour, he was always cheered by the prospect of action. Professional to the core of his being, Cornwallis demonstrated the highest qualities of an admiral; his leadership, vision, and determination were unsurpassed, and only the accident of history, the one that denied him a great battle, has kept him out of the pantheon of naval immortals. Although he never had the opportunity to win a great victory, his pivotal role in the years of maximum danger, between 1800 and 1805, reflected leadership, judgement, and professional qualities of the highest order. Like his friend Nelson he had the insight to function at the highest level, and the steadiness to do so at the one place where the war could be lost. Rather than defeating a French fleet he secured a greater victory, defeating Napoleon's strategy. His blockade of the coast of Brittany, through all seasons and all weathers, remains the ultimate achievement of seapower in the age of sail. He held the centre, around which the greatest contest between land and sea power yet waged was played out.<br>
