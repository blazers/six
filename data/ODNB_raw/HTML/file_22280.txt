</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pilkington, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1628&#150;1691), <span class="occ">merchant and politician</span>, was born on 30 March 1628, the eldest son and heir of Thomas Pilkington (<i>d</i>. 1637), landowner of Northampton, and his second wife, Anne, the daughter of Edward Mercer, also of Northampton. Pilkington's father successfully established the family's gentry status but after his death Pilkington was apprenticed, in 1645, to a prominent London Levant merchant, Thomas Barnardiston. Barnardiston provided him with access to the City's leading commercial circles and to its leading presbyterian families. Pilkington married Hannah Bromwich of Gracechurch Street at St Peter Cornhill on 13 June 1654. They had four sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Pilkington was first elected an assistant of the Levant Company in 1657, and he held that office almost continuously for the next quarter century. His trade was largely with Smyrna, where he employed as many as eleven different factors over his career. Pilkington served on the London common council for Dowgate in 1667&#150;77 and was elected bridgemaster in 1675 and 1680. Chosen deputy governor of the society that superintended the corporation's Irish interests on three occasions in the 1670s, he was also master of the Skinners' Company in 1677&#150;8 and again in 1681&#150;2. By 1677 he was living in Scotch Yard, Bush Lane, in the parish of All Hallows-the-Great and, in time, he acquired a country home at Eltham, Kent.<br>
<br>Pilkington's election to the common council coincided with the beginnings of nonconformist political assertiveness in Restoration London. In 1673&#150;4, as opposition activities in the corporation escalated, he was chosen for committees that drafted a petition to the crown alleging a decline in London's trade and that considered a motion for more frequent common council meetings. Identified by one critic with a 1675 civic cabal who &#145;hate Prerogative&#146;, Pilkington also acquired a reputation for militant anti-Catholicism  (BL, Add. MS 34362, fol. 13). That reputation secured his election as London MP to the three parliaments of the exclusion crisis in 1679&#150;81. In the 1679 parliament he served on committees to enhance security against popery and to promote the export of cloth to Turkey. A defender of the credibility of the informer Titus Oates, Pilkington established himself as one of the most outspoken Commons' advocates of the exclusion of James, duke of York, from the throne. In May 1679 he demanded York's return to England so &#145;that we may impeach him of High Treason&#146;  (Grey, 7.238), and he also sought specifically to incorporate exclusion into a popular London petition demanding parliamentary action on behalf of protestantism.<br>
<br>Triumphing against loyalist efforts to replace him and Sir Thomas Player as City MPs, Pilkington was chosen for a London seat again in October 1679. He was one of the promoters of the London petition of December 1679&#150;January 1680 which attempted to pressure the king into calling a parliamentary session. As prorogation followed prorogation Pilkington assisted in the election of fellow nonconformists Slingsby Bethel and Henry Cornish as sheriffs of London and Middlesex for 1680&#150;81. When the parliament of 1680&#150;81 finally met Pilkington was a member of the committee that drafted a second exclusion bill in November; and he was among the promoters of another London petition against York. Also a member of a committee that inquired into judicial behaviour Pilkington presented a London address critical of corporation recorder Sir George Jeffreys, who had worked against some civic petitions, and whom Pilkington condemned as &#145;a common enemy of mankind&#146;  (Grey, 7.464). He supported the impeachments of Lord Stafford and Edward Seymour, and he favoured efforts to end the coercion of nonconformists in order to facilitate protestant union. Having served as deputy alderman for Dowgate in 1677&#150;80 Pilkington was returned for two aldermanic vacancies in 1680 and joined the court of aldermen in December 1680 for the ward of Farringdon Without.<br>
<br>After the third Exclusion Parliament of March 1681 Pilkington assisted in drafting a city petition for another parliament and was elected sheriff of London and Middlesex with Samuel Shute. Charles II declined to knight them, as would have been customary. The new sheriffs worked hand-in-glove for the next year with country and civic whig leaders to turn the corporation of London into a political forum to take the place of parliament. Charles was equally determined to crush the whigs in London, just as he had out-manoeuvred them in parliament, but in Pilkington he found an opponent determined to fight him at every turn. When Charles tried to destroy the earl of Shaftesbury through a treason accusation Pilkington and Shute empanelled a London jury of dissenters and whigs for Shaftesbury's trial. When the jury threw out the indictment against the earl in November 1681 Pilkington ignored court orders to disperse whig crowds and feasted Shaftesbury, who had recently become a member of the Skinners' Company, at Skinners' Hall.<br>
<br>When Charles retaliated with his <i>quo warranto</i> against the corporation's charter Pilkington received the writ, as sheriff, with one of the verbal barrages for which he was becoming noted. &#145;His tongue speaks naked swords&#146;, sneered one loyalist poet  (Lord, 3.195), while Bishop Gilbert Burnet remembered him as &#145;an indiscreet man, that gave himself great liberties in discourse&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 2.348). When the duke of York returned to London in April 1682 Pilkington told his fellow aldermen that he would &#145;rather go live in a hermit's cell&#146; than agree to an address welcoming the heir to the throne. Indeed tory aldermen claimed that Pilkington said James &#145;had twice burnt this City and was now come to cut the inhabitants' throats&#146; (London Newsletters, 8.34, 25 March 1682; <span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1682</i>, 194). At the time Pilkington was deeply involved with Shaftesbury and the duke of Monmouth in organizing a banqueting campaign to maintain opposition enthusiasm in London and elsewhere. York promptly initiated a <i>scandalum magnatum</i> suit against Pilkington, but the sheriff's friends claimed that the allegation and the suit were really political contrivances intended to silence him and to disrupt whig activities.<br>
<br>Despite his legal vulnerability Pilkington played a critical role in the London shrieval election of 1682, an unprecedented three-month affair that gave Charles control of the City, drove some whigs to conspiracy, and influenced the arguments for resistance being developed by Algernon Sidney and John Locke. Pilkington was unswerving in his insistence that the London electors, as the &#145;supreme authority&#146; in the corporation, had a right to choose both sheriffs, despite the crown's claim that the loyalist lord mayor, Sir John Moore, had a customary right to name one of them  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1682</i>, 417). Standoffs between the lord mayor and the sheriffs in common hall elections and disorderly polls in June, July, and September snapped tempers and left many citizens fearing either popular violence or, in Pilkington's words, &#145;military government&#146;  (Luttrell, 1.225). An infuriated king threw Pilkington and Shute into the Tower at one point for encouraging &#145;tumultuary meetings&#146; on behalf of the whig shrieval candidates, Thomas Papillon and John Dubois  (London Newsletters, 8.76, 29 June 1682). Pilkington, Shute, and other whig activists were also charged with riot after the first common hall. When the court accepted the lord mayor's ultimate declaration of the election for loyalists Dudley North and Peter Rich, despite an obvious electoral majority for the whigs, Pilkington took the lead in refusing to recognize the legitimacy of the election. Indeed, according to one source, he confronted the king-in-council with a declaration of the people's right to &#145;fortifie&#146; themselves against such an encroachment upon their liberties  (ibid., 8.116, 21 Sept 1682).<br>
<br>The crown's capture of the shrievalty left it in charge of judicial processes in London and led to what Pilkington remembered as the &#145;Egyptian bondage&#146;  (<span class="italic">House of Lords MSS</span>, 3.49). He was one of the chief sufferers in the court sponsored loyalist reaction of 1682&#150;5. Already fined &pound;800 by a Surrey jury in a libel action brought by the king's perfumer and argued by Jeffreys, Pilkington was found guilty of the <i>scandalum magnatum</i> in November 1682 by a Hertfordshire jury that awarded the future James II &pound;100,000 in damages. Pilkington relinquished his aldermanic place and accepted imprisonment after taking measures to protect his estate. In 1683 he and the other city &#145;rioters&#146; were found guilty and fined, and the crown secured a king's bench judgment against the City charter. Despite Pilkington's reputation among loyalists as &#145;a disturber of mankind&#146;, James pardoned him in June 1686 and remitted his staggering fine  (Singer, 1.481). Pilkington returned to his trade, which his friend Henry Ashurst had looked after during his imprisonment.<br>
<br>A supporter of the prince of Orange in 1688&#150;9 Pilkington was returned to the Convention Parliament from the City, was elected alderman for Vintry, and was chosen lord mayor upon the death of his predecessor. Knighted by William III, he was also appointed a London lieutenancy commissioner, a JP for Kent, an assessment commissioner for London and Northampton, and a commissioner for preventing the export of wool. The legal judgment against Pilkington and the other whig &#145;rioters&#146; of 1682 was reversed in 1689, but the Commons rejected their petition to secure repayment of their fines from Sir John Moore and the tory sheriffs of 1682&#150;3 rather than from the government.<br>
<br>Leaving parliamentary leadership to the other London whig MPs, Pilkington focused on the corporation. Imprisonment had not tamed his political temper. He continued to relive the traumas of the exclusion era, and he refused to accept William's turn to the tories in 1690. When he was re-elected lord mayor in September 1689 his mayoral show celebrated the rescue of London's liberties from an arbitrary government, but in the parliamentary election of March 1690 the London liverymen replaced him and his fellow whig City MPs with four churchmen. As lord mayor Pilkington promoted a measure brought to the new parliament by the London whigs and intended to broaden electoral rights as well as to release common council and common hall from magisterial restraint. The church tory parliamentary majority not only rejected this measure but, in the <span class="roman">Corporation of London Act</span> (1690), imposed new elections for the mayoralty, the shrievalty, and common council. Pilkington was then continued as lord mayor by his whig aldermanic colleagues, despite a slight common hall majority for a church tory candidate.<br>
<br>During William's absence in Ireland and the French invasion scare of July 1690 Pilkington blocked the efforts of Secretary Nottingham to regulate contested common council elections. He also gave the queen-in-council a &#145;short, pertinent and quick Speech&#146; about the need to remove disaffected tories from the government and from the London lieutenancy commission  (Morrice, ent'ring book R. 171). These episodes left some privy councillors ready to return Pilkington to the Tower, and the tory common councilmen unsuccessfully petitioned the Commons in hopes of dislodging him and his whig aldermanic colleagues. Pilkington finished his mayoralty in October 1691, having served for an unusual two and a half years, and he died intestate on 16 November. His fortune seems to have suffered from his fines, imprisonment, and political preoccupations. The aldermen granted a small civic pension to his daughter. William Pilkington, his son and sometime Smyrna factor, followed him in trade and became consul at Aleppo.<br>
