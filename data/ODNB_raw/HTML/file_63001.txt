<span class="headword">Clark,  John</span>  (1798/9&#150;1857), <span class="occ">architect</span>, gave his address as Edinburgh in 1826 on the foundation plate of his first recorded building in Leeds, but nothing is known about his early life or his architectural training. He was a contemporary of Thomas Hamilton and William Henry Playfair, the leading Greek revival architects in Edinburgh, and his early buildings are similar to theirs in character. It was with a Greek revival design that Clark first came into prominence in Leeds, the expanding industrial town which offered good architectural opportunities in the 1820s. In 1825 a limited competition was held for the Commercial Buildings, an ambitious undertaking estimated to cost &pound;30,000. It was to combine commercial uses with a concert room and news room. In 1826 designs were received from Charles Barry, Robert Dennis Chantrell, Francis Goodwin, Anthony Salvin, and Thomas Taylor, as well as from Clark; the last was declared the winner, although according to the <span class="italic">Leeds Intelligencer</span> he had been the favoured architect from the beginning. This suggests that his work was already known in the town, although his obituary in the <span class="italic">Building Chronicle</span> states that this building &#145;was the occasion of Mr. Clark's introduction to Leeds&#146;  (<span class="italic">Building Chronicle</span>, May 1857, 197). Built on a corner site, the curved Ionic screen on the angle was crowned by a circular drum ornamented with a cornice and a honeysuckle scroll taken from the choragic monument of Lysicrates. Inside there was an elegant room shown in Clark's watercolour <span class="italic">Leeds Commercial Buildings</span> (n.d.) in the collection of the Thoresby Society, Leeds.<br>
<br>The success of this building led Clark to set up in practice in Leeds, and his work extended also to other parts of Yorkshire. He designed mansions on the northern fringe of Leeds for wealthy merchants and industrialists, such as Gledhow Grove (1830s) for John Hives, for whom he also built Bank Mills (1833), Meanwood Hall for Christopher Beckett (<i>c</i>.1834), and Roundhay Hall for William Smith (<i>c</i>.1840, attributed). All were in a Greek style which was beginning to verge on the Italianate. For Woodhouse cemetery, a private burial-ground, he designed an Ionic mortuary chapel and a Doric gate-lodge (1835). In the town itself Clark built the Trustee Savings Bank in Bond Street (1834), a Soane-like design, and the Yorkshire District Bank in Boar Lane (1836). In the newly fashionable Woodhouse area he built a number of brick villas with stone dressings, including Woodsley House (<i>c</i>.1840&#150;1841) in Clarendon Road for Sir Peter Fairbairn, in which Queen Victoria stayed when she formally opened Leeds town hall in 1858, houses in Woodhouse Square (1840), as well as an extension to John Atkinson's house, Little Woodhouse (1835). He made a design in the Gothic style for St George's Church, Mount Pleasant (1836&#150;8), and ones in the Tudor style for a library and master's house attached to the grammar school (1830), and for almshouses at Woodhouse (<i>c</i>.1840). Outside Leeds, he built the Wilberforce Column, Hull (1834), a huge Doric memorial to the celebrated Yorkshire MP; Airedale College, Bradford (1831&#150;4); a Gothic house, St Catherine's, near Doncaster, for George Banks (1838); and the Royal Chalybeate Spa, Harrogate (1835). Like ninety-six other aspiring architects, Clark submitted an entry in the competition for the new Houses of Parliament (1835); like most, he was unsuccessful. He died at 6 Park Square, Leeds, on 16 April 1857 &#145;after a protracted illness of eight years [and was] followed to the grave by the regrets of his numerous friends&#146;  (<span class="italic">Building Chronicle</span>, May 1857, 197).<br>
