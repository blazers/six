<span class="headword">Kodicek,  Egon Hynek</span>  (1908&#150;1982), <span class="occ">biochemist and nutritionist</span>, was born on 3 August 1908 in Kamenny Ujezd, Bohemia, the son of Emma and Samuel Kodicek. In 1915 his father, a doctor, moved with the family to Budweis, as medical chief of the military hospital there. Egon attended the local <i>Gymnasium</i> (<i>c</i>.1918&#150;1927), where he read widely, cultivating a lasting interest in philosophy. He was good at sports, which he continued to enjoy during his medical course at Charles University in Prague. A brilliant scholar, he graduated as MD in 1932. He then joined the university's department of internal medicine and began his lifelong research on vitamins. The greatest influence on his career came from his studies with J. Heyrovsk&yacute; at the Physicochemical Institute, which convinced him of the importance of measurement in biological research. Heyrovsk&yacute; had invented the analytical technique of polarography, for which he received the 1959 Nobel prize for chemistry. Kodicek's early polarographic determinations of vitamin A and folic acid (a vitamin required for production of blood cells) in foods and animal tissues gained him several awards, including the Masaryk Fund prize for research (1938).<br>
<br>The German occupation of Prague in March 1939 made it imperative for Kodicek, who was of Jewish origin, to leave Czechoslovakia. He was offered a place at the Dunn Nutritional Laboratory in Cambridge, only just managing to avoid arrest while awaiting a visa. He reached Cambridge in June 1939. On arriving in Cambridge, Kodicek registered as a research student at Trinity College and was awarded a PhD in 1942 for his research on nicotinic acid. Kodicek had in 1936 married Jindriska (Jindra) E. M. Hradeck&aacute;, an ophthalmic surgeon who had been a fellow student at medical school. She and their daughter Jana finally escaped in August, and the family lived initially on a grant from the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning. Their second daughter, Ivana, was born in 1943. Cambridge became the family's permanent home, and the Dunn Laboratory for thirty-four years the base for Kodicek's wide-ranging work. Vitamins and hormones formed the core of his research, and he developed methods of analysis of their often minute concentrations in tissues. Kodicek's measurements of vitamin C, riboflavin, and nicotinic acid helped government assessments of the nutritional value of wartime diets. His shrewd applications of new physical techniques, notably isotopic labelling, fluorimetry, ultracentrifugation, and chromatography, promoted recognition of nutritional research as a respected science.<br>
<br>Kodicek declined offers from the USA, and in 1947 the family became naturalized British subjects. He continued investigations on nicotinic acid (later named niacin). This compound is responsible for the prevention of pellagra, a serious disease associated with diets based on maize. Kodicek found that much of the niacin in cereals was bound in a macromolecular matrix, and was nutritionally unavailable. Severe deficiency of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) was known to impair healing of wounds, and Kodicek explored this effect extensively at the Dunn Laboratory, demonstrating abnormalities in connective tissue proteins and carbohydrates; but the biochemical complexities were beyond the scope of existing techniques.<br>
<br>Kodicek's frustrations on the vitamin C front were compensated by manifold achievements in research on the steroidal vitamin D (calciferol), which is essential for the control of calcium absorption and metabolism; serious deficiency leads to the soft bones characteristic of rickets. The term vitamin D comprises two compounds of very similar structure, vitamin D<sub>2</sub>, derived from yeast, and vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, derived from cholesterol. The vitamins are produced (both in nature and commercially) by the action of ultraviolet light on precursor sterols. Studies of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol), in which hydrogen atoms in certain C-H bonds had been partly replaced by radioactive tritium, indicated loss of tritium&#151;and correspondingly of hydrogen&#151;from two sites during metabolism. It transpired that C-H was being converted into C-OH, yielding hydroxy-vitamins responsible for bioactivity. H. F. DeLuca at Wisconsin identified 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, while 1&#945;,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol), discovered in Kodicek's laboratory in 1969, proved to be the hormone, metabolically elaborated from the vitamin, that stimulated calcium uptake by the intestine. Kodicek's magnificent contribution to the elucidation of the action of vitamin D was his crowning achievement, and a vindication of his appointment in 1963 as director of his laboratory. After retirement in 1973, he continued research, until overtaken by ill health, at the Strangeways Research Laboratory, Cambridge, investigating his hypothesis (which few accepted) that vitamin D was directly active in bone formation. After his death, it was shown that the bone-forming cells were indeed targets for the action of 1&#945;,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol.<br>
<br>By virtue of his experience, wisdom, and encyclopaedic knowledge&#151;leavened by beamish geniality&#151;Kodicek chaired innumerable national and international committees. His many awards included the British Nutrition Foundation prize, and (jointly with DeLuca) the 1974 Roussel prize. A long-standing Biochemical Society member, and Ciba medallist, he also became an honorary member of the Nutrition Society, after being president from 1971 to 1974. He was elected FRS in 1973 and appointed CBE in 1974.<br>
<br>Kodicek's lifelong enthusiasm was an inspiration to his students, and to attenders at meetings who experienced his warm avuncularity (gently spiked with incisive criticism). He died at his home, 11 Bulstrode Gardens, Cambridge, on 27 July 1982.<br>
