<span class="headword">Orme,  Daniel</span>  (1766&#150;1837), <span class="occ">painter and engraver</span>, was born in Manchester on 25 August 1766, the son of Aaron Orme (1707&#150;1782), a fustian manufacturer, and his third wife, Margaret Walmsley (<i>bap</i>. 1739, <i>d</i>. 1808). He was an older brother of the artist and publisher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37824/', "Edward Orme")</script> and also of the painter William Orme (1771&#150;1854). He entered the Royal Academy Schools on 7 March 1785 and was noted as being &#145;18 years old, 25th last August&#146;  (Hutchison, 148). In 1787 he married Ann Barr, and the following year he reputedly competed for the Royal Academy's gold medal. He continued to live in London, where he practised as a portrait painter in oil and in miniature and also as an engraver, working closely in particular with the American-born artist Mather Brown (1761&#150;1831). From 1792 to about 1797 Brown and Orme formed a partnership to exhibit large history paintings as a loss-leader for the sale of subscription prints after Brown's paintings. The pair concentrated on scenes from contemporary history&#151;similar to those popularized by the American artist John Singleton Copley (1737&#150;1815)&#151;especially recent naval events. One instance of such collaboration between painter and engraver centred on the painting by Mather (now in the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich) of Lord Howe on the quarter-deck of the <i>Queen Charlotte</i> with &#145;the affecting death of the amiable Captain Neville of the queen's regiment&#146;. The picture was advertised as being nautically accurate and also &#145;entirely novel&#146;, as, it was claimed, it was the first naval and portrait subject painted for this type of exhibition. It was exhibited&#151;apparently without charge&#151;in Orme's premises at 14 Old Bond Street from January to April 1795. Orme's large print (943 cm &times; 58 cm), for which the oil was effectively the advance publicity, was issued on 1 October 1795, at 1 guinea to subscribers. Interestingly, Orme also produced separate small prints of individual portraits from the scene, as well as an informative key to the whole identifying the ships and the personnel shown (copies of the large print and of the key are also in the National Maritime Museum). Another of Orme's naval subjects has been immortalized on Sunderland pottery; the moment when John (Jack) Crawford, a sailor, &#145;heroically nailed Admiral Duncan's flag to the main top gallant mast of the Venerable after it had been shot away by Admiral de Winter in the glorious action off Camperdown Oct. 11<sup>th</sup> 1797&#146;  (inscription on pottery cited in Baker, cat. no. 51). Orme's engraving is after a sketch he is said to have made on board the flagship <i>Venerable</i> and was published on 21 November 1797. It is notable that Orme exhibited at the Royal Academy only for five years, from 1797 to 1801; he showed nearly forty miniatures, many with a marked naval association, such as his portrait of Lady Nelson exhibited in 1799.<br>
<br>Orme also engraved his own works&#151;subject pictures such as <span class="italic">Alexander and Thais</span>&#151;as well as portraits after other artists, such as <span class="italic">Admiral the Earl of St Vincent</span> after Daniel Gardner. He was appointed engraver to George III, and in 1814 he styled himself artist to his majesty and the prince regent. In October 1814 he returned to Manchester and resided at 40 Piccadilly, where he gave lessons in oil painting, drawing, and etching and continued his portrait painting both in oil and in miniature. He was represented in the first exhibition of the Royal Manchester Institution in 1827 by one portrait, <span class="italic">William Butterworth, the Oldham Hermit</span>. He died at Buxton, Derbyshire, in 1837. There is a small drawing, slightly washed in colour&#151;<span class="italic">New Pier, Margate</span>&#151;in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. A self-portrait in oil by Orme showing him with his sketchbook is still in the collection at Althorp, Northamptonshire. Other paintings and prints by him are in the National Maritime Museum.<br>
