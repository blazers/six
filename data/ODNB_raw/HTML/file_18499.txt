<span class="headword">Medley,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1747), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the son of Robert Medley (1650&#150;1708), lawyer, and Dorothy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Grimston (<i>d</i>. 1691). He married Anne Gooch (<i>d</i>. 1733). Medley entered the navy in 1703 and three years later was a midshipman of the <i>Somerset</i> with Captain Price at the relief of Barcelona. He passed his examination on 8 February 1710, was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Fame</i> by Sir John Norris on 5 September, and was moved into the <i>Stirling Castle</i> a few months later. In 1717 he was a lieutenant of the <i>Barfleur</i>, flagship of Sir George Byng in the Baltic. Early in 1720 he was promoted to the command of the fireship <i>Poole</i>, and on 17 February 1721 he was posted into the <i>York</i>. In 1722, while commanding the <i>Leopard</i> in the Mediterranean, he seized a ship named the <i>Revolution</i>, lying within the mole of Genoa, on information that she was in the service of James Francis Edward Stuart, the Old Pretender. Medley afterwards commanded the <i>Leopard</i> on the coast of Portugal and in the channel until the end of 1728. On 5 May 1730 he was given command of the <i>Diamond</i>; on 19 May 1731 he moved to the <i>Romney</i>, and on 12 May 1732 he was appointed captain of the <i>Gibraltar</i> which he took to Virginia and Maryland. On 8 August 1734 he arrived back at Spithead; he was then sent cruising, and during this period retook a British brigantine from Barbary corsairs. On 8 November 1734 Medley assumed command of the <i>Dreadnought</i>. He served in Sir John Norris's squadron at Lisbon from 1735, becoming at one point after Norris's departure in 1737 the senior officer of the force. In September 1737 the <i>Dreadnought</i> was ordered to be paid off. Medley was then moved to the <i>Romney</i>. During 1739 and 1740 he convoyed the Newfoundland fishing fleet to the fishing grounds and to the Lisbon market. On 29 January 1741 he took command of the <i>Nassau</i> in the Channel Fleet under Norris, and in 1742&#150;4 he was with Norris as captain of the fleet. On 19 June 1744 he was promoted rear-admiral of the white, and in the following winter he commanded a squadron cruising in the Soundings for the protection of trade. On 23 April 1745 he was promoted vice-admiral of the blue, and sent out as commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean. The service was one of blockade and co-operation with the Austro-Sardinian armies which, in the winter of 1746&#150;7, drove the French out of Italy, and then invaded Provence. Medley's squadron closely supported the invading armies but, after an unsuccessful attack on Antibes, the Austro-Sardinians were obliged to retire. Medley continued to maintain support to the allied armies. On 15 July 1747, he was advanced to vice-admiral of the red, but he died of fever at Vado on 5 August 1747, probably in ignorance of his last promotion. His body was taken back to England and buried at St Michael-le-Belfrey church in York on 10 December. A monument to Medley was placed in the north choir aisle of York Minster.<br>
