<span class="headword">Blague,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1545&#150;1611), <span class="occ">dean of Rochester</span>, was a native of Gloucester. He was admitted pensioner at Queens' College, Cambridge, at Easter 1568, seemingly after proceeding BA at Oxford the previous year. While at Queens' he compiled an anthology of classical aphorisms in translation, <span class="italic">A Schoole of Wise Conceytes</span> (1572). On 18 June 1574 he supplicated at Oxford for the degree of BTh as a bachelor of seven years' standing and proceeded DTh on 2 April 1582. The higher degree was incorporated at Cambridge in 1589.<br>
<br>His successive clerical appointments suggest that Blague was a man not much given to residency. He was instituted rector of Great Braxted, Essex, on 9 September 1570 at the presentation of George Talbot, sixth earl of Shrewsbury, and collated rector of St Vedast, Foster Lane, in the city of London by Archbishop Matthew Parker on 2 September 1571. Appointed one of Parker's household chaplains, he was collated rector of Lambeth by his successor, Edmund Grindal, in 1577, thereafter resigning St Vedast. As chaplain to Grindal he assisted at the consecration of John Aylmer, bishop of London, on 24 March 1577. On 20 July 1580 he was instituted to the rectory of Ewelme, Oxfordshire, on the crown's presentation and (probably in 1582) was appointed a chaplain-in-ordinary to Elizabeth. Presented to the deanery of Rochester by the crown on 14 January 1592, he was installed on 1 February. He resigned Ewelme in 1596 but became rector of Crayford, Kent, in 1599 and in 1604 succeeded Richard Vaughan, newly promoted bishop of London, as rector of Bangor Is-coed, Flintshire.<br>
<br>Blague remained a royal chaplain after the accession of James I, serving a monthly turn in May alongside Anthony Rudd, bishop of St David's, and Henry Hooke, later archdeacon of the West Riding. In this capacity he greeted James I during his progress south to London and preached the Tuesday court sermon in the chapel of the London Charterhouse on 10 May 1603, when the new king, consciously retracing the entry into London of his predecessor in November 1558, stayed there as a guest of Thomas, Lord Howard de Walden, who was to be created earl of Suffolk only weeks later. One of those present&#151;perhaps Henry Hooke or else a member of the Howard family (the epistle dedicatory is signed &#145;H. H.&#146;)&#151;had the sermon (on <span class="roman">Psalms</span> 1: 1&#150;2) published, but without submitting the text to Blague himself for correction, &#145;supposing it to be comfortable a doctrine to others, as he found it delightfull to himselfe&#146; and commending &#145;the grave and methodicall delivery thereof&#146;  (Blague, <span class="italic">Sermon</span>, epistle dedicatory). The sermon is a felicitous rather than admonitory piece, in which Blague offers advice to his new monarch&#151;the <i>beatus vir</i> of the psalm&#151;cautioning him not to take ungodly counsel nor associate with sinners or scorners. Rather he is to delight in and meditate upon the law. Like other royal chaplains that year Blague was at pains to emphasize the new king's obligations as a righteous lawgiver who would exercise justice and mercy.<br>
<br>In 1604&#151;as dean of Rochester, rector of Great Braxted, rector of Lambeth, and rector of Crayford&#151;Blague was blacklisted in a puritan survey of the Essex clergy: he had not come to Great Braxted &#145;paste once or twice this eighte yeres laste paste&#146;; it was claimed that he derived an annual income of &pound;70 from Great Braxted, &pound;160 from Lambeth, and &pound;120 from Crayford  (<span class="italic">A Viewe</span>, 10). As rector of Lambeth he was responsible for the interment of Archbishop Richard Bancroft in November 1610, and died in possession of all his preferments except St Vedast and Ewelme.<br>
<br>Blague married twice. His first wife, Mary Holborne, whom he married in 1572, died without children, and in 1575 or 1576 he married Alice Brock (<i>b</i>. 1560), who, at fifteen, was half her husband's age. The Blagues make frequent appearances in the papers of the doctor and astrologer Simon Forman, whom they consulted many times, in both his capacities. In 1597, for instance, Blague was hoping for the see of Salisbury and asked Forman for a prognostication of his chances of success. His wife, who appears in the astrologer's notebooks as extravagant and promiscuous, wanted advice over her health but more especially about her love affairs, which included a prolonged liaison with Owen Wood, dean of Armagh, as well as a brief involvement with Forman himself. Nevertheless Blague saluted Alice in his will, drawn up on 4 October 1611, a week before he died, for &#145;her wisdome and fidelitie&#146;, and made her his sole executor. Blague died at Lambeth on 11 October 1611 and was buried at the parish church. He was survived by his wife and three sons, John (who became a fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, and to whom Blague bequeathed his sermon notes &#145;if he will use them right&#146;), Cornwallis, and Edmund. Their daughter Frances, wife of John Dove, had died in 1604, leaving a daughter whom Blague remembered in his will. About a year after her husband's death Alice married Walter Meysey, keeper of a portion of the Gatehouse prison at Westminster, but they soon separated, largely owing to debts which she brought with her from her first marriage and which she had herself principally incurred. It is not known when she died.<br>
