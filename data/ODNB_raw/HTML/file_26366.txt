<span class="headword">Whitby,  Stephen  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1112?), <span class="occ">abbot of Whitby and of St Mary's, York</span>, was one of the leading figures in the revival of monastic life in the north after the Norman conquest. Almost all that is known of him derives from a narrative account which allegedly came from his own hand. The authenticity of this has been much debated, but scholarly opinion now tends to favour acceptance of the narrative as the genuine tradition preserved at St Mary's. Stephen was probably of noble birth, but his first recorded appearance was as a monk at the newly revived monastery at Whitby (<i>c</i>.1078), and shortly afterwards he was elected abbot, taking control of the community from the hermit Reinfrid. However, within a few years hostility from Whitby's lay patron, William de Percy (<i>d</i>. 1096), forced Stephen and a section of the community to move to the former monastery at Lastingham, granted by William I at Stephen's request as a secure retreat from pirate attacks. By 1086 they had moved again, to the outskirts of the city of York. Stephen had taken the advice of Count Alan, of Brittany and Richmond&#151;a man who had been well known to him before his conversion&#151;that an urban location would be advantageous for attracting endowments, and had accepted his offer of the church of St Olave in Marygate. <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> records the abbot of York, unnamed, as a Yorkshire landholder. Two years later, in 1088 or 1089, Stephen secured an even greater success when William II took the community into royal patronage, and provided a larger site adjacent to St Olave's, where the king himself is said to have cut the first turf in preparation for the building of St Mary's Abbey.<br>
<br>The creation of a powerful monastic corporation close to the city brought Stephen into conflict with Archbishop Thomas (I) of York (<i>d</i>. 1100), and William II stepped in to resolve the dispute and compensate the archbishop for losses that he claimed to have sustained as a result of the foundation of St Mary's. Other sources attest a close relationship between Stephen and his royal patron. William entrusted Stephen with the task of arresting Abbot Benedict of Selby, and during the primacy dispute with Canterbury Archbishop Thomas (II) (<i>d</i>. 1114) requested Stephen to use his influence with Henry I to favour York's cause. Stephen took a leading role in ecclesiastical affairs, and with Abbot Hugh of Selby and other prominent churchmen attended the translation of the relics of St Cuthbert at Durham in 1104. Stephen probably died in 1112, and was certainly dead by 1113, when he had been succeeded by Abbot Richard.<br>
<br>A key figure in the formative years of what was to become the premier religious house in the north, during his lifetime Stephen was described by Simeon of Durham as an energetic and efficient abbot of his monastery. He maintained excellent relations with successive kings, and charter evidence attests to the success which St Mary's enjoyed during his abbacy in attracting endowments from all the major barons of the region.<br>
