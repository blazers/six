<span class="headword">Spencer,  John</span>, first Earl Spencer  (1734&#150;1783), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 19 December 1734, the only son of John Spencer (1708&#150;1746), a landowner, and his first wife, Georgiana Caroline (1716&#150;1780), the third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4804/', "John Carteret, second Earl Granville (1690&#150;1763)")</script>. Since he had not been expected to survive infancy he was educated at home by tutors. His younger sister Diana died aged only eight.<br>
<br>Spencer was just eleven and a half when in the summer of 1746 his father died and he succeeded to the considerable family estates. He also inherited the bulk of the property, including the new house and park at Wimbledon, left by the will of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5405/', "Sarah Churchill, duchess of Marlborough")</script>, but with the strict proviso that if he accepted any office or pension from the crown this inheritance was to pass to the next heir. Until he came of age, however, he could not take control of this fortune. His estates and finances were managed by trustees, while he went on a grand tour of France and Italy and gained a lifelong interest in art and architecture.<br>
<br>On 20 December 1755, the day after his twenty-first birthday, Spencer married Margaret Georgiana Poyntz (1737&#150;1814) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39563/', "Spencer, (Margaret) Georgiana")</script>], the eighteen-year-old daughter of a leading diplomatist, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22694/', "Stephen Poyntz")</script>, of Midgham House, Berkshire, and his wife, Anna Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mordaunt. The marriage ceremony, unusually, took place in private. While five hundred guests were being entertained at a ball at Althorp, those privy to the secret withdrew to a large upstairs room for the marriage. Not until Christmas was the news made public. In the new year husband and wife drove to London and were presented at court, where they became close friends of the royal family. They soon had a growing family of their own: Georgiana (1757&#150;1806), later duchess of Devonshire [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4934/', "Cavendish, Georgiana")</script>], <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26125/', "George John Spencer (1758&#150;1834)")</script>, who succeeded his father as the second earl, and Henrietta, known as Harriet (1761&#150;1821) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38506/', "Ponsonby, Henrietta Frances")</script>], who married Viscount Duncannon, heir to the earl of Bessborough.<br>
<br>Although his political prospects were rendered nugatory by the terms of Sarah Churchill's will, Spencer, after an expensive by-election defeat at Bristol in 1756, entered the House of Commons later that year as MP for Warwick. He was a member of the old whig corps, and the duke of Newcastle secured him a viscountcy in 1761. He followed Newcastle into opposition in 1762, and when the former Newcastle party returned to office in 1765 was rewarded with an earldom. He rarely attended the House of Lords on account of his poor state of health.<br>
<br>By this time Spencer was the owner of a magnificent London house. Designed by John Vardy, this Palladian mansion overlooked Green Park, and took ten years, from 1756 to 1765, to build. Its beautiful rooms, some the work of Vardy's rival James &#145;Athenian&#146; Stuart, became the centre for great entertainments and the home of a fine collection of Italian paintings and family portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough. Spencer and his wife, however, preferred life at the family home, Althorp. There, looked after by eighty servants, he built up a fine library, especially strong in history, literature, and classical mythology. But his chief passion was hunting. As master of the Pytchley hunt, he spent more on the sport and his stables than on the day-to-day running of his houses. Despite all this considerable expenditure on top of an excessive love of gambling, Spencer still found the resources to improve his main inheritance from Sarah Churchill, the house and park at Wimbledon. In 1760 he commissioned Capability Brown to transform the park into a place described in one newspaper of 1785 as &#145;perhaps as beautiful as anything near London&#146;. He held garden parties on the lawns, and enjoyed himself shooting, as well as fishing in the new lake. He also employed Stuart to redecorate the house in the latest neo-classical style. Wimbledon thus became the perfect country retreat from the noise, dirt, and disease of London, especially in the spring and at midsummer. Lady Spencer, writing to her son in the spring of 1781, expressed her delight in &#145;the beauty of the scene, the birds, the flowers, the verdure and every other charms the country abounds with&#146;  (BL, Althorp MSS, G275).<br>
<br>Throughout the 1760s and the 1770s Spencer suffered from a series of illnesses&#151;crippling chest and stomach pains, gout, and various fevers and nervous palpitations. To restore his health he paid frequent visits to Bath to drink the waters and to Scarborough to bathe and take the sea air. He often crossed the channel to stay at Spa or to go on grand tours with his family. In all these troubles he was supported by his strong Anglican faith and the devotion of his wife. During the summer of 1783, however, even Georgiana confessed in a letter to her son that she became &#145;quite discouraged&#146; as &#145;all his old complaints returned&#146;  (BL, Althorp MSS, G276). She took him to Margate and finally in late September back to Bath. Spencer seemed no better for taking the waters, but managed to ride every day. Then on 25 October Georgiana, &#145;sadly alarmed&#146;, wrote to her son that his father &#145;now wanders when he wakes and is not sure where he is&#146;  (BL, Althorp MSS, G276). Six days later, on 31 October 1783, he died in Bath. He was only forty-eight years old. He was buried on 9 November in the family vault at St Mary's Church, Great Brington, just outside the gates of Althorp Park. &#145;Handsome with dark romantic looks&#146;  (Friedman, 38), Spencer was said to be &#145;generous and amiable&#146;  (Le Marchant), although very extravagant and at times bad-tempered because of almost continuous ill health. He left his son massive debts, yet greatly increased his family estates and also its prestige by being the employer of leading architects, the collector of Italian paintings, and the friend and patron of Sir Joshua Reynolds, Laurence Sterne, David Garrick, and Thomas Linley. His widow died in St Albans on 18 March 1814 and was buried in St Mary's Church, Great Brington, on 30 March.<br>
