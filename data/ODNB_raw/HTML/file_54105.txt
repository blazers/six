<span class="headword">Morris,  Ivan Ira Esme</span>  (1925&#150;1976), <span class="occ">Japanologist</span>, was born on 29 November 1925 at 45 Cromwell Road, London, the son of Ira Victor Morris and Edit Dagmar Emilia (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Toll). His father, an American, was a member of a well-to-do family related to the Guggenheims; his mother the daughter of a Swedish general. His father was a journalist and both parents were successful novelists. Morris's childhood language was Swedish, and when he first attended school in Britain he was taunted because of his Swedish accent. His elementary and secondary schooling were in Britain (at some point he attended Gordonstoun School), and he struck everyone who met him as being English, but he had American as well as British citizenship, and during the Second World War studied at the Japanese language school of the United States navy. After the war, in 1946, he obtained his bachelor's degree at Harvard University.<br>
<br>Morris subsequently returned to Britain and continued his study of Japanese at the School of Oriental and African Languages of the University of London. While writing his thesis on <span class="italic">The Tale of Genji</span> (he received the degree of PhD in 1951) he became acquainted with Arthur Waley. He would later acknowledge his indebtedness to Waley, his teacher and model, by editing <span class="italic">Madly Singing in the Mountains</span> (1970), a collection of remembrances of Waley written by friends. In the elegance of the English prose into which he rendered the Japanese classics, Morris was Waley's only successor.<br>
<br>Morris entered the Foreign Office as senior research assistant after receiving his doctorate, then went on to Japan with a grant from the Royal Institute of International Affairs. His <span class="italic">Nationalism and the Right Wing in Japan</span> (1960) reflects his early interest in Japanese politics. He and his students also translated <span class="italic">Thought and Behaviour in Modern Japanese Politics</span> (1963), a collection of essays by the political scientist Masao Maruyama. His name, however, is most frequently associated with the works of Japanese literature, both classical and modern, that he translated and discussed. Perhaps his most beautiful translations are <span class="italic">The Pillow Book of Sei Sh&#333;nagon</span> (1961) and the diary he called <span class="italic">As I Crossed a Bridge of Dreams</span> (1971), both works by court ladies of the eleventh century. His English was that of a virtuoso; the translation, into an idiom reminiscent of Defoe, of the seventeenth-century novelist Saikaku's <span class="italic">The Life of an Amorous Woman</span> (1963) is nothing short of dazzling. It was typical of his scholarship that he verified each word in his translation to be sure it was used in the eighteenth century. Although he intended his books for non-specialists and was at pains to make his writings not only scholarly but a delight to read, no Western scholar of Japanese literature has given more attention to small details; there is a whole volume of footnotes accompanying <span class="italic">The Pillow Book</span>. He loved research into minutiae, and could make the smallest item of information of interest by his witty presentation; but his original works, such as <span class="italic">The World of the Shining Prince</span> (1964), a study of the Japanese aristocracy in the eleventh century, and <span class="italic">The Nobility of Failure</span> (1975), were conceived on a grand scale. The latter work uses examples chosen from as far back as ancient Japanese legend and as recently as the kamikaze attacks of the Second World War to illustrate Morris's belief that the typical Japanese hero is a man who, having known glory, finally suffers defeat. Of his translations of modern Japanese literature, the best-known is <span class="italic">The Temple of the Golden Pavilion</span> (1959) by Yukio Mishima.<br>
<br>In 1960 Morris joined the department of east Asian languages and cultures at Columbia University, New York, where he taught Japanese literature and history and served as chairman of the department from 1966 to 1969. Apart from his teaching and scholarship, he wrote theatrical criticism, compiled puzzle books, and was an enthusiastic chess player. He was the founder of the United States section of Amnesty International and spent innumerable hours on behalf of prisoners of conscience. He was president of the American affiliate at the time of his death. His three marriages (the second to Ayako Ogawa, the third to Nobuko Uenishi) all ended in divorce. He died in Bologna of a heart attack on 19 July 1976, and was buried at Nesle, near Rozay-en-Brie, Seine et Marne, France, where he had a home.<br>
