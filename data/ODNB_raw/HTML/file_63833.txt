<span class="headword">Schonell, Sir  Fred Joyce</span>  (1900&#150;1969), <span class="occ">educationist and university administrator</span>, was born on 3 August 1900 in Perth, Western Australia, the son of Edward William Schonell, a headmaster, and his wife, Agnes Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mawer. His early education was at Perth modern school. Having taught between 1921 and 1922, he graduated BA in English from the University of Western Australia in 1925. In the following year he moved to London, where he returned to teaching. With a Hackett scholarship awarded by the University of Western Australia he was a research student under Cyril Burt and Percy Nunn at the Institute of Education and King's College, London, between 1929 and 1931, gaining a PhD in education in 1932. On 22 December 1926 he married Florence Eleanor Waterman, with whom he collaborated closely on a number of educational projects until her death in 1962; she was the daughter of William de Bracey Waterman of Perth, Western Australia. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Partly in step with his postgraduate research, Schonell had taken additional courses in educational theory and teacher training at Cambridge and the Institute of Education in London, obtaining a teaching diploma from the latter in 1929, while still continuing to teach and to research into aspects of educational psychology. He evolved his diagnostic and remedial techniques in schools in London and Kent while a lecturer in education at Goldsmiths' College, University of London. He held that post from 1931 until 1942, when he was appointed professor of education at University College, Swansea, where he built up a major department. In 1946 he succeeded Charles Wilfrid Valentine as professor of education at the University of Birmingham, where he was closely concerned with setting up a new institute of education, a research department, and a remedial education centre. He was awarded a DLit from London in 1943 and an MA from Birmingham in 1947.<br>
<br>Schonell returned to Australia in 1950 to become professor of education at the University of Queensland where he built up the education faculty and established a remedial centre on similar lines to that in Birmingham. In 1960 he became the first vice-chancellor of the university to be appointed from the academic community (a position previously held by prominent lay figures in an honorary capacity), playing a prominent role in promoting and developing the university during his nine-year tenure from 1960 until his death.<br>
<br>Schonell was a considerable researcher and a prolific author with a particular interest in children who would be diagnosed today as having learning difficulties. Between 1932 and 1962, for instance, he published over fifteen books, including <span class="italic">Backwardness in the Basic Subjects</span> (1942), <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Attainment Tests</span> (1949), and <span class="italic">Diagnosis and Remedial Teaching in Arithmetic</span> (1957). His major long-term interest was in the problems that such children encountered with reading, spelling, and simple arithmetic. This concern took in both the detection and the improvement of deficiencies in such key skills. His widely utilized diagnostic tests for arithmetic and intelligence can be seen as directly expressing this interest, as can his series of elementary books designed to improve performance in English and arithmetic. His <span class="roman">Happy Venture</span> series of reading books sold in millions to primary schools in Britain and the Commonwealth. The regime that his books for use in schools promoted was that the material should be arranged in strictly increasing order of difficulty, and that progression from the easier to the more demanding material should be based on a rigorous grading scheme.<br>
<br>Schonell served on numerous committees and professional bodies. He was at various times honorary secretary of the education section, president of the midland branch, and council member of the British Psychological Society (BPS). He was made an honorary fellow of the BPS in 1966. After 1950 he was equally active in the Australian branch of the BPS, later becoming a fellow of the newly autonomous Australian Psychological Society. In 1959 he was elected a fellow of the Australian College of Education. He was president of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science from 1965 to 1966 and national chairman of the Winston Churchill Fellowship selection committee from 1966, as well as serving on the council of the Association of Commonwealth Universities. Outside his academic life, his main interests were in art, music, and, especially, Elizabethan theatre.<br>
<br>Schonell was made a knight bachelor in 1962 and received honorary doctorates from the universities of Western Australia (1963) and Sydney (1965). He died of lymphatic cancer on 22 February 1969 at his home in Rutledge Street, Indooroopilly, Brisbane, a few months before his intended retirement date. After a funeral service at St John's Anglican Cathedral in Brisbane he was cremated at the Mount Thompson crematorium, Brisbane, on 26 February.<br>
