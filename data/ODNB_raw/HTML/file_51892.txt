<span class="headword">Barlow,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1669&#150;1730), <span class="occ">builder and estate surveyor</span>, played a significant part in the expansion of the West End of London which took place in the first three decades of the eighteenth century. Nothing is known about his origins and early life. In a deposition sworn in April 1721 he gave his age as about fifty-two, which would suggest that he was born in the late 1660s, and he was probably the Thomas Barlow who married Ann Kinsey at St Giles Cripplegate on 18 November 1689. His first wife's name was certainly Ann, and by the late 1690s they were living in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, where they had numerous children, only one of whom, a son, Richard, born in 1709, survived infancy. Ann Barlow died in 1713, and on 14 August 1715 at St Martin-in-the-Fields Barlow married Bridget Scarlett as his second wife.<br>
<br>Barlow worked as a carpenter in Covent Garden, undertaking substantial repairs to the roof of St Paul's Church in 1714&#150;15 and erecting a flagpole in the piazza to celebrate the accession of George I in 1714. He played a prominent part in the life of the parish, acting as churchwarden in 1712&#150;14. He also undertook speculative house building, both in Covent Garden and elsewhere. In 1701 he was building in Albemarle Street, and shortly afterwards erected a large house in New Bond Street for the duke of Grafton. He built other houses in this area, including one in New Bond Street in which he and his second wife lived after moving from Maiden Lane. Barlow Place, off Bruton Street, is named after him. He was also building in Queen Square, Holborn, in 1709&#150;11.<br>
<br>In 1715 Barlow appeared in a new capacity as agent for Lord Scarbrough, the landowner, in negotiations over the site of the future church of St George, Hanover Square. He may thus have been responsible for the layout of the Hanover Square area. He undoubtedly built several of the large, Germanic style houses in Hanover Square and St George Street. Letters from him about the fitting out of one of the latter for its first occupant, Earl Cowper, are preserved in the Hertfordshire Record Office (Herts. ALS).<br>
<br>On 10 August 1720 Barlow, who had by then a well-established reputation as a master builder, was given his most important commission when Sir Richard Grosvenor appointed him to oversee the development of his family's hundred-acre estate in Mayfair. The work was to be carried out according to &#145;a Scheme or Plann of the Said Intended Building &hellip; Drawn by the said Barlow&#146;  (Grosvenor archives, Eaton Hall, fourth baronet's personal MSS). With such a large area at his disposal Barlow could plan on a lavish scale, and his grid of wide, straight streets centred on Grosvenor Square, which itself covers some 8 acres and is the largest square in London apart from Lincoln's Inn Fields, is an outstanding example of early Georgian town planning.<br>
<br>Barlow took a long lease of a large area in the south-east corner of the estate, doubtless to encourage other builders to follow suit, and erected the first building on the estate, the Mount Coffee House in Grosvenor Street (now demolished), where much of his business was apparently conducted. In general, however, he built little on the estate, concentrating instead on his duties as estate surveyor in drawing up building agreements and arranging for leases to be granted to other builders.<br>
<br>Barlow was one of the founder directors of the Westminster Fire Office, a commissioner of sewers for Westminster, and one of the initial members of the select vestry of the new parish of St George, Hanover Square. When he died on 17 January 1730 he was described as &#145;a very noted Master-Builder&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Post</span>, 22 Jan 1730). His funeral took place on 21 January at St Paul's, Covent Garden, where his first wife and several of his children were buried. He was said to have left a leasehold estate worth &pound;600 per annum in ground rents, &pound;500 in improved rents, and &pound;400 in rack rents, besides a personal estate of upwards of &pound;1000. His widow, Bridget, died in 1733, and his son, Richard, in 1740, &#145;haveing greatly wasted and outrun his fortune&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C12/2201/2).<br>
