<span class="headword">D&iacute;cuil</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>795&#150;825), <span class="occ">scholar and teacher</span>, of Irish descent, went to the continent some time between 795 and 814 as one of an international constellation of Anglo-Saxon, Visigothic, Italian, and Irish scholars attracted to the court of Charlemagne (<i>r</i>. 768&#150;814). The palatine scholars provided impetus and direction to the Carolingian reform of education and learning.<br>
<br>D&iacute;cuil wrote in prose and in poetry for an emperor and for schoolboys. His talents ranged over Latin grammar, astronomy, calendar reckoning, and geography. A careful schoolmaster, he often outlined the contents of his works, recorded the dates of their composition, and noted his own literary output. While his works lack style and polish, they are remarkable for their originality and keen critical sense.<br>
<br>In 814, probably while teaching at the palace school, D&iacute;cuil began work on his <span class="italic">Liber de astronomia et computo</span>, which he dedicated in four yearly instalments to the emperor Louis the Pious (<i>r</i>. 814&#150;40). The work, which alternates prose with poetry, enabled D&iacute;cuil to display his erudition and virtuosity in two fields, metrics and time reckoning (computus). The extensive use of poetry served to honour the emperor and to encourage his continued patronage. D&iacute;cuil's verses also served a mnemonic function when they conveyed difficult computistical rules. Verse could also be used to entertain. &#145;In these verses I playfully spin puzzles&#146;  (&#145;Astronomical treatise&#146;, ed. Esposito, 392), D&iacute;cuil announced when he showed the emperor how the four verse endings of four hexameters could be manipulated to produce seventy-two hexameters. He repeated the ingenious exercise in the second book of his treatise where he worked the permutation to produce 166 verses based on the same limited vocabulary. His model was Optatianus Porfyrius, court poet to Constantine the Great. Porfyrian verse, especially acrostic and figure poems, enjoyed great vogue among Carolingian court poets.<br>
<br>Computus, one of the few disciplines specifically emphasized in Carolingian educational reform legislation, also attracted considerable attention among scholars and royal patrons. Proper observance of the liturgical cycle required delicate calculations between solar and lunar calendar systems and knowledge of astronomical phenomena. The variety of calculations and rules inherited from earlier centuries and cultures proved difficult for Carolingian computists when they tried to devise an efficient and uniform method of time reckoning. Charlemagne was deeply interested in calendar and astronomical problems and in 809 charged a committee of computus experts to resolve disagreements. In 811, D&uacute;ngal, another Irish scholar, replied with a wide-ranging letter to Charlemagne's request for information on solar eclipses. D&iacute;cuil's <span class="italic">Liber de astronomia et computo</span> is a product of this intense interest in astronomical and calendar issues.<br>
<br>D&iacute;cuil's treatise had no impact in the ninth century. The author himself acknowledged that even Louis the Pious turned a deaf ear to its metrical passages and did not reward the scholar for his efforts. D&iacute;cuil's misfortune was to write on computus for the wrong emperor; Louis did not share his father's enthusiasm for the subject. Nevertheless, D&iacute;cuil's treatise remains significant on its own merits. Unlike the more widely copied <span class="italic">De computo</span> of Hrabanus Maurus (<i>c</i>.780&#150;856), D&iacute;cuil's work is that of an experienced computist thinking through the theoretical problems that vexed his colleagues. Hrabanus Maurus's compilation provided a polished, general overview of its subject, better fitted for non-specialists than D&iacute;cuil's technical and terse, but more critical and innovative, treatise. D&iacute;cuil's computus opens with a set of calculations for determining that if one begins the year in April, April will be the first month of the year 814. Modern commentators have not appreciated the force of D&iacute;cuil's example. Medieval calendars were lunisolar. Since the lunar year is approximately eleven days shorter than the solar year, the lunar and solar months diverge after three years. To correct this discrepancy, computists inserted a periodic <i>saltus lunae</i> (&#145;moon's leap&#146;) into their calculations. D&iacute;cuil's formula, based on the pedagogically astute strategy of proceeding from the familiar and the particular (the example of the current year) to general principles, attempted to provide a simple calculation to reconcile easily the lunar and solar cycles. Although D&iacute;cuil drew on Pliny and Isidore of Seville, he critically appraised his sources. He refrained from discussing the effect of the moon on the ocean since, writing far from the ocean's shores, he could not verify the sources. He challenged received tradition regarding the south polar star and planetary orbits. When his own ingenuity failed him, he encouraged his readers to improve upon the unsatisfactory explanations found in his sources and expressed his readiness to follow his colleagues' solutions to obscure questions rather than those of earlier authorities.<br>
<br>D&iacute;cuil's critical spirit also animated his second major work, the <span class="italic">De mensura orbis terrae</span>, completed in 825. Its nine chapters treat in order Europe, Asia, Africa, Egypt, and Ethiopia, the longitude and latitude of the earth, rivers, islands, the latitude and longitude of the Tyrrhenian Sea, and the six principal mountains. D&iacute;cuil began his book, the first medieval geography, with an evaluation of the merits of his authorities. He preferred the Theodosian <span class="italic">Divisio orbis</span> to Pliny the Elder's more ancient and authoritative <span class="italic">Naturalis historia</span> because he believed that the envoys of the Roman emperor Theodosius II (<i>r</i>. 408&#150;50) actually measured the distances they recorded. D&iacute;cuil also noted that scribal mistakes sometimes falsified the distances reported in manuscripts of Pliny's work. In these cases, he left spaces blank which readers with access to better manuscripts could complete with correct numbers. D&iacute;cuil's attitude toward texts prefigures that of the noted bibliophile, Abbot Lupus of Ferri&egrave;res (<i>c</i>.805&#150;<i>c</i>.862). Although much of D&iacute;cuil's text derives from his sources, he approached these not as a mere compiler, but as a scholar. He challenged Solinus's statement that elephants could not lie down on the basis of the evidence provided by Abul Abaz, the elephant Caliph Harun-al-Rashid presented to Charlemagne. He reported at length the experiences of Irish monks who had visited remote islands in the north Atlantic and used their information again to challenge Solinus. He described his own voyages among the islands north of Britain: &#145;I have never found these islands mentioned in the authorities&#146;  (vii, 15, ed. Tierney and Bieler). The sources likewise were silent on the canal that joined the Nile to the Red Sea. Young D&iacute;cuil, however, had overheard Fidelis (a pilgrim and presumably a fellow Irishman) report on the canal and other Egyptian wonders to Suibne, D&iacute;cuil's teacher. In addition to preferring the authority of contemporaries over traditional textual sources, D&iacute;cuil maintained a healthy scepticism towards claims made for exotic places. He doubted Solinus's account of the eating habits of the people who dwell on the Ganges, as well as his description of the crocodile. He questioned Isidore of Seville's figures for the circumference of Sicily. He again took Solinus to task for describing Mount Atlas both as snow-covered and as rising above the clouds. Experience indicates that snow falls from clouds, thus the mountain's snow-covered peaks cannot rise above the clouds.<br>
<br>D&iacute;cuil noted in the preface to the <span class="italic">De mensura orbis terrae</span> that he had just completed an <span class="italic">Epistula de quaestionibus decem artis grammaticae</span>. This work is lost, but three other minor works emanating from D&iacute;cuil's teaching survive: the <span class="italic">De prima syllaba</span> was also written in 825, as a guide to Latin prosody for &#145;little boys&#146;; his <span class="italic">Epistula censuum</span> (unpublished), composed in 818, begins with 225 verses on weights and measures and includes a glossary of homonyms and synonyms; and the twenty-seven hexameters he wrote to accompany the text of Priscian's <span class="italic">Partitiones duodecim versuum Aeneidos principalium</span>, a fundamental Carolingian schoolbook, summarized the contents of Priscian's work for D&iacute;cuil's pupils. It is not known when D&iacute;cuil died.<br>
