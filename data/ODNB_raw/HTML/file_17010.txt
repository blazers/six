<span class="headword">Lopes, Sir  Manasseh Masseh</span>, first baronet  (1755&#150;1831), <span class="occ">landowner and politician</span>, was born Manasseh Lopes in Jamaica on 27 January 1755, only son of Mordecai Rodriguez Lopes (<i>d</i>. 1796), plantation owner, and Rebecca, daughter of Manasseh Pereira of Jamaica. He came from a family of Sephardic Jews who had become very wealthy as sugar planters in Jamaica and he inherited a substantial fortune on the death of his father in 1796, who had settled in Clapham, Surrey. Lopes was believed to have spent &pound;100,000 buying the Heywood estates at Maristow, Devon, in 1798 and he continued to buy land around Plymouth, so that by 1820 he was one of the largest landowners in Devon. He also invested heavily in the East India Company and gave &pound;5000 to the loyalty loan of 1797. On 19 October 1795 he married Charlotte Yeates, daughter of John Yeates of Monmouthshire; they had one child, Esther, who died on 1 July 1819. In 1802 Lopes was baptized in the Church of England and the same year was returned to parliament for New Romney, Kent. He became a firm supporter of Pitt and for his loyalty received a baronetcy on 1 November 1805; he also obtained a royal licence to add Masseh to his name. He was not a candidate at the 1806 general election and his election as MP for Evesham, Worcester, in 1807 was declared void on the grounds that some of his votes had been illegal. In 1810 he purchased the borough of Westbury from Montagu Bertie, fifth earl of Abingdon, at a cost of some &pound;75,000 with the intention of ensuring his electoral success, although he decided to contest Barnstaple in Devon at a by-election in January 1812. Defeated by the opposition candidate, William Busk, he succeeded at the general election later that year, as did the two government candidates at Westbury, but he found himself considerably out of pocket as a result. After failing to receive compensatory patronage from Lord Melbourne, he voiced his dismay to Lord Liverpool and claimed that he had been treated with &#145;total neglect and disregard&#146; by those he had so faithfully supported  (Fisher, 456).<br>
<br>It is possible that Lopes's discontent, coupled with his political ambition, tempted him into using corrupt practices to win votes. With the assistance of a contingent of electors, his agent secured Lopes's return for Grampound in Cornwall by bribing forty voters with &pound;35 apiece. This bribery became known only after a petition was lodged against Lopes following his 1818 election in Barnstaple, in which he was accused of making payments to voters. For his first offence he was brought to trial at Exeter assizes before Mr Justice Holroyd and a special jury on 18 March 1819 and he was convicted. He then stood trial for the allegations made at Barnstaple where it was found he had spent &pound;3000 in bribes, and had bribed 63 of the 300 resident electors at &pound;5 each. Although the house saw fit to unseat him, he was acquitted &#145;from defect of proof&#146; at Devon assizes in August 1819  (Fisher, 457). On 13 November he was sentenced to two years' imprisonment and a fine of &pound;10,000 by the court of king's bench. In the eyes of a number of MPs, such as Lord John Russell and even Lopes's counsel, James Scarlett, his sentence was seen as a necessary measure against electoral corruption. Brougham and the Holland House set, however, thought that he had been unfairly singled out for a crime of which many MPs were guilty. On his release from prison Lopes continued in public life and was returned in 1823 for his pocket borough of Westbury. Despite his unpopularity he successfully stood again in 1826, but later resigned his seat to provide for Peel on his rejection by Oxford University in 1829. Lopes, who served as a magistrate for Devon and Wiltshire, and from 1810 was recorder of Westbury, died at his seat, Maristow House, on 26 March 1831 and was buried at Bickleigh, Devon. He left a fortune of &pound;800,000, principally in government and East India stock, but also in land. His nephew and heir, Ralph Franco, assumed the surname Lopes on succeeding to the baronetcy.<br>
