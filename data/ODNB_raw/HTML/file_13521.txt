<span class="headword">Holland,  Henry</span>  (1555/6&#150;1603), <span class="occ">writer on witchcraft</span>, was educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge, and graduated BA in 1579 or 1580. In 1580, aged twenty-four, he was ordained priest in the diocese of Ely and appointed vicar of Orwell, Cambridgeshire. In 1594 he moved to St Bride's, London.<br>
<br>Holland's theology was Calvinist. He was a firm predestinarian and placed a heavy emphasis on the active role of divine providence. Like many contemporary divines he was troubled by the failure of the bulk of the laity to comprehend the essential truths of Calvinism. Despite sermons and treatises the &#145;poor sheep&#146;, the &#145;seelie men&#146;, continued to adhere to a semi-pelagian position that confused the &#145;righteousness of faith and the righteousness of men&#146;  (Holland, <span class="italic">David's Faith and Repentance</span>). They also refused to respond properly to providential affliction. Rather than accept in patience and turn to God, they met misfortune with the resources of traditional magic as purveyed by the &#145;cunning-folk&#146;. Holland shared other concerns with his clerical contemporaries. He was a sabbatarian, an opponent of dancing and of modern fashion&#151;&#145;misfiguring of head and face &hellip; following of strange attire&#146;  (Holland, <span class="italic">Christian Exercise of Fasting</span>, 192&#150;3). After settling in the City of London he expressed his loathing for the capital's theatre, &#145;the nurceries of whoredome and uncleanesse&#146;  (Holland, <span class="italic">Spirituall Preservatives</span>, dedication; <span class="italic">The Historie of Adam</span>, fol. 93<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Holland was a diligent parish minister; catechizing, expounding scripture, and preaching. Edward Topsell, the editor of his posthumous work <span class="italic">The Historie of Adam</span> (1606), attributed his death to his strenuous activity in his function. The bulk of his published works began as sermons: <span class="italic">David's Faith and Repentance</span> (1589), <span class="italic">The Christian Exercise of Fasting</span> (1596), and <span class="italic">Spirituall Preservatives Against the Pestilence</span> (1593, 1603). He was also a translator and an editor. His edition in 1599 and 1600 of the works of Richard Greenham (<i>d</i>. 1594), the great &#145;physician of the conscience&#146; and his near neighbour in Cambridgeshire, cost him a good deal of effort in collecting and collating the manuscripts in which Greenham's &#145;cases of conscience&#146; circulated. Holland's one scholarly treatise is his <span class="italic">Treatise of Witchcraft</span> (1590). This has a double inspiration. Like the related works of George Gifford and William Perkins, the <span class="italic">Treatise</span> was partly inspired by the &#145;brutish ignorance&#146; of the &#145;rude people&#146; that led them into &#145;a continuall trafficke and market&#146;  (Holland, <span class="italic">Witchcraft</span>, sig. A4) with the purveyors of folk magic. But Holland also sought to confute the sceptical arguments of Reginald Scot, and to do this he borrowed heavily from continental demonologists like Bodin, Daneau, and Hemmingsen: even the inquisitor authors of the <span class="italic">Malleus malificarum</span> receive favourable mention. In consequence Holland's tract, despite its populist intentions and solemn translations of all the Latin texts, has a curiously remote and academic flavour. The discussion of the diabolic covenant, sabbats, magical transformations, and transportations, sit as uneasily with the English popular beliefs and practices that he is ostensibly seeking to confute.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Holland was a conformist. He was not involved in any of the stirs instigated by many of the puritan ministers, his colleagues, in London in the 1590s. His works are dedicated to a variety of members of the Elizabethan lay establishment, from the court, legal, and civic hierarchies. He fulsomely praises Elizabeth's regime and, unlike Perkins, refuses to criticize overtly what he clearly viewed as the inadequacies of the legislation against witches and its enforcement. His unexpected death in London in August 1603 left his wife and children in some financial difficulties.<br>
