<span class="headword">Spence,  Benjamin Evans</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1823, <em>d.</em> 1866), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born probably in Liverpool and was baptized on 3 January 1823 at St Peter's, Church Street, Liverpool, the eldest son of William Spence (1792&#150;1849), sculptor, and his wife, Elizabeth. His father was a partner in Spence and Franceys (monumental masons) and was in the circle of the Liverpool art patron William Roscoe. In 1838 Benjamin attended the Liverpool Academy Schools, exhibiting busts there from 1838 to 1841 and in 1843. In 1844 he showed, at the Westminster Hall exhibition in London as well, <span class="italic">The Death of the Duke of York at the Battle of Agincourt</span>, which was awarded the Heywood silver medal by the Royal Manchester Institution in 1846. In that year he went to Rome and entered the studio of his father's friend John Gibson, who observed that &#145;he is sadly behind in art&#146;  (23 June 1846, Crouchley papers). Sensing that Gibson's strict neo-classical style was not his m&eacute;tier, Spence joined the studio of Richard James Wyatt, the sculptor of serene nymphs, after whose death in 1850 he completed the works sold at Christies in London on 22 June 1861.<br>
<br>Spence's initial exhibit at the Royal Academy in 1848, <span class="italic">Lavinia</span> (on the London art market 1990), from James Thomson's <span class="italic">Seasons</span> (commissioned by the Liverpool builder Samuel Holme), displays the tranquillity characteristic of Wyatt's work. Subjects taken from favourite authors of the day, such as Robert Burns, Shakespeare, or Sir Walter Scott, became a hallmark of Spence's sculpture. <span class="italic">Highland Mary</span>, a sculpture of Burns's early love, first carved around 1852 for Charles Meigh of Grove House, Shelton, was his most popular work in this vein. Often repeated, a version was given as a birthday present by Prince Albert to Queen Victoria in 1853 (Royal Collection). Similar works include <span class="italic">The Angel's Whisper</span> (version <i>c</i>.1857, Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay, Paris), illustrating a lyric by Samuel Laver, and <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span> (1861, Royal Collection), from Scott's poem, commissioned by Victoria and Albert as a companion to <span class="italic">Highland Mary</span> and <span class="italic">Oberon and Titania</span> (1866, Victoria and Albert Museum, London). These figures, while recognizably within Wyatt's classical style, are given precise identity by the addition of realistic details such as a plaid or thistle&#151;in &#145;a new and popular character&#146;, according to William Bell Scott  (Scott, 132). Although Spence showed at the RA six times, most sales came through contacts made in Rome: he did &#145;a good trade&#146;, commented Alfred Gatley, a fellow sculptor, as a result of his &#145;evening parties&#146;  (Gatley MSS). The Liverpool banker Richard Naylor, his most loyal patron, owned a version of <span class="italic">Highland Mary</span>, <span class="italic">Dora and Margaret Naylor</span>, <span class="italic">Mrs Naylor with Rowland and Christopher</span>, and <span class="italic">The Finding of Moses</span> (all Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), the last of which was shown at the 1862 International Exhibition in London, and <span class="italic">The Seasons</span>. His only public commission, for St George's Hall in Liverpool, was <span class="italic">Reverend Jonathan Brooks (1775&#150;1855), Rector of Liverpool</span> (<i>in situ</i>, St George's Hall); it was delivered in 1858 for &pound;1200. For the Crystal Palace at Sydenham, Kent, he appropriately carved a monumental figure <span class="italic">Liverpool</span>.<br>
<br>After Spence's death from consumption and pulmonary disease at his father-in-law's house in Leghorn, Italy, on 28 October 1866, his widow, Rosina, daughter of G. H. Gower, the British consul there, gave twelve plasters from his studio to Liverpool (three survive in Picton Library, Liverpool). The remaining marbles were sold at Christies on 4 June 1870. Spence was among the last of the British artists who made a living in Rome by selling primarily to their visiting countrymen. His career represents the final phase of Rome's dominance on the visual arts in Britain.<br>
