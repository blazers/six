<span class="headword">Docwra <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Waldegrave]</span>,  Anne</span>  (<em>c.</em>1624&#150;1710), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, was the eldest daughter of Sir William Waldegrave of Bures, Suffolk, of a leading gentry family and a justice under Charles I. When she was about fifteen her father stimulated what became her considerable study of the law by directing her to read the statutes of the realm, since women &#145;must live under [the laws] as well as men&#146;  (Mack, 316). Her antecedents were Anglican and her political views remained basically royalist; the date of her Quaker &#145;convincement&#146; is not known, but she married a member of a well-established landed family, James Docwra (1617&#150;1672), who became a Quaker before 1655, in which year he left lands in trust for the benefit of Friends. Following her husband's death in 1672 she moved into Cambridge, where she made her home available for Friends' meetings and the accommodation of travelling ministers.<br>
<br>Because, as she claimed, Christ died &#145;to end shadows and typical forms&#146;  (Mack, 317), she regretted the growing formalism of the Friends' post-Restoration administrative and disciplinary structures, and opposed separate women's meetings on the grounds that St Paul had debarred women from having authority over men; women, however, could prophesy and guide men Friends in the administration of charity funds. Her first published work, partly in verse, <span class="italic">A looking-glass for the recorder and justices of the peace and grand juries for the town and county of Cambridge</span> (1682) forms an eloquent plea for toleration&#151;&#145;Force makes Hypocrites&#146;  (Phillipson, &#145;Quakerism in Cambridge before the Act of Toleration&#146;, 23). In the following year she visited George Fox (1626&#150;1691) and other Quaker leaders in London to discuss disagreements over Friends' church government, and, invoking her royalist credentials, wrote a defence of women's ministry, <span class="italic">An epistle of love and good advice to my old friends and fellow-sufferers in the late times, the old royalists</span>. In the same year her <span class="italic">A Brief Discovery of the Work of the Enemy of Sion's Peace</span> commented on expulsions of dissidents from the society. <span class="italic">True Intelligence to be Read and Considered in the Light</span> (1683) opposed administrative &#145;Formalities and Directories&#146;  (ibid., 22).<br>
<br>Anne Docwra was, apparently, immune from persecution throughout the post-Restoration period, perhaps, as she claimed, as a result of her knowledge of the law and also, probably, because of her rank and background, and maybe in return for the clear royalist standpoint she and some local Friends professed in 1680. In 1687 her <span class="italic">Spiritual Community Vindicated amongst People of Different Perswasions in some Things</span> fully supported James II's pursuit of toleration. In 1699, in <span class="italic">An Apostate Conscience Exposed</span>, she attacked her nephew, the Quaker renegade <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3890/', "Francis Bugg (1640&#150;1727)")</script>: the work also contains a vivid defence of Fox's simplicity of life against Bugg's charges of luxury against the Quaker leader. In the following year, in <span class="italic">The Second Part of an Apostate Conscience Exposed</span>, Docwra countered Bugg's riposte, <span class="italic">Jezebel Withstood</span>.<br>
<br>Docwra's enduring gift to Cambridge Friends came in a two-part legacy in 1700 and 1710, in which she gave an estate in Jesus Lane to the society with a 1000 year lease; in her will, dated 4 and 6 May 1710, by now living in reduced circumstances, she made further bequests to several Friends, confirmed her husband's earlier gifts of lands, and added a gift of &pound;20 for a graveyard. She died the same year in Cambridge, where she was buried.<br>
<br>Criticized both by Bugg and by voices of mainstream Quakerism in her day, an individualist difficult to contain within an organization acquiring structural coherence, Anne Docwra was a spirited, intelligent, articulate, educated, and wise lady, one who preferred &#145;rational argument to visionary insight&#146;  (Mack, 316) and who yet held to a deep spiritual sense of the Quaker &#145;glad tidings of the Light&#146;  (ibid., 318).<br>
