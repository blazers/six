<span class="headword">Cazalet,  Peter Victor Ferdinand</span>  (1907&#150;1973), <span class="occ">racehorse trainer</span>, was born on 15 January 1907 at Fairlawne, near Tonbridge in Kent, the fourth and youngest child and third son of William Marshall Cazalet (1865&#150;1932) of Fairlawne and his wife, Maud Lucia Heron, daughter of Sir John Robert Heron-Maxwell, seventh baronet, of Springkell, Dumfriesshire. The Cazalets were a Basque family who came to England as Huguenot refugees. Peter Cazalet was educated at Eton College, where he developed as an excellent all-round player of ball games and made a century in the cricket match against Harrow at Lord's, and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he obtained a third-class degree in chemistry in 1930, a cricket blue, and half-blues for rackets, real tennis, and squash.<br>
<br>It was during his three years at Christ Church that the young man, who as a child used to hide whenever a pony was produced, suddenly took to riding. Determined, fearless, and superbly co-ordinated, he soon became a proficient amateur rider over fences and hurdles. After a brief unproductive flirtation with industrial chemistry, he spent two years improving his jockeyship and learning stable management with the successful Berkshire trainer Sonny Hall.<br>
<br>In 1932 Peter Cazalet inherited Fairlawne, a large William and Mary house, his eldest brother having been killed in the First World War and the second brother wishing to live elsewhere. He began to build up his own small string of jumpers with H. E. (Harry) Whiteman holding the trainer's licence. It was then, in the early thirties, that Anthony Mildmay, who had been in Cazalet's house at Eton, asked whether he could come and ride out in the mornings on his way to work in the City. Thus was born a friendship and sporting partnership which flourished until Mildmay's untimely death by drowning in 1950. Its saddest and best known moment, at least before the war, was when Mildmay's reins came unbuckled in the 1936 Grand National, allowing his horse Davy Jones, who had a clear lead and looked a certain winner, to run off the course before the last fence. Cazalet rode in that and four other Nationals but a bad fall in 1939 compelled him to give up riding and take out his own trainer's licence.<br>
<br>Cazalet spent the Second World War first in the Royal Artillery (1939&#150;40) and then, with Mildmay as one of his platoon commanders, as a Welsh Guards company commander in the guards armoured division. The moment peace came the two friends returned to Fairlawne, determined to create a training stable run on the best possible lines and, above all, to win the Grand National, preferably with Mildmay in the saddle. That goal was thwarted for a second time when Mildmay finished a close third on Cromwell in 1948, having ridden blind over the last two fences with his head forced down on his chest by an attack of cramp (a similar attack almost certainly caused his death two years later). The friends never achieved a Grand National win but Mildmay&#151;M'Lord as a devoted racing public knew him&#151;was leading amateur in each of the post-war seasons leading up to his death, and did National Hunt racing a great service by communicating his enthusiasm to Queen Elizabeth and persuading her and her daughter Princess Elizabeth to have a horse in training with Cazalet. The partnership horse, Monaveen, won for the first time in 1949 but when Princess Elizabeth became queen she decided to concentrate on flat racing, so it was in the queen mother's blue and buff colours that Dick Francis went out from the Cazalet stable to ride Devon Loch in the 1956 Grand National. Fifty yards from the winning post, with victory in his grasp, Devon Loch collapsed. That bitter disappointment did not diminish the queen mother's support for National Hunt racing and, of the 1100 winners Cazalet trained at Fairlawne, more than 250 carried her colours. They were ridden by several great stable jockeys including Bryan Marshall, Dick Francis, Bill Rees, Arthur Freeman, and, perhaps the most stylish of all, David Mould.<br>
<br>Three times leading trainer, Cazalet sent out what was then a record total of eighty-two winners in 1964&#150;5. Fairlawne was run on old-fashioned lines but, though a strict disciplinarian with a merciless eye for detail, its master was also scrupulously fair. A high proportion of his stable lads stayed with him throughout their working lives and were both glad and proud to do so. They and the horses alike were always beautifully turned out and, even if some later trainers with all-weather gallops at their disposal might reckon the Fairlawne facilities barely adequate, the Cazalet horses were always as fit as horses can be made.<br>
<br>Himself rather shy and uninterested in what he considered pointless chit-chat, Cazalet was, by normal standards, a somewhat aloof figure on the racecourse. But, once formed, his friendships were very seldom broken and often a highly developed sense of humour warmed and brightened his attitude to life.<br>
<br>On 14 December 1932 Cazalet married Leonora, daughter of Leonard Rowley and stepdaughter of the author P. G. Wodehouse; they had a son and daughter. Their son, Edward, particularly delighted his father by becoming a first-rate amateur rider; having forsaken the turf for the bar, he later became a QC and a judge. Leonora Cazalet died in 1944 while undergoing a minor operation and in 1949 Cazalet married Zara Sophie Kathleen Mary, daughter of Sir Harry Stapleton Mainwaring, fifth baronet, and former wife of Major (Alexander) Ronald George Strutt, later fourth Baron Belper, with whom she had one son. She and Cazalet had three sons, one of whom died in 1956.<br>
<br>Cazalet died at Fairlawne on 29 May 1973. Each January, weather permitting, the Anthony Mildmay Peter Cazalet memorial steeplechase is run over 3 miles 5 furlongs at Sandown. When it was first run, called simply the Mildmay memorial, Cazalet won it with Cromwell, Mildmay's favourite horse, ridden by Bryan Marshall.<br>
