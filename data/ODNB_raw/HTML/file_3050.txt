<span class="headword">Bowes, Sir  George</span>  (1527&#150;1580), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was the eldest surviving son of Richard Bowes, esquire (<i>c</i>.1497&#150;1558), soldier, and his wife [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3048/', "Bowes, Elizabeth (bap. 1505, d. in or before 1572)")</script>], the coheir of William Aske of Aske in the North Riding of Yorkshire. In 1534 he was contracted to Dorothy (<i>d</i>. before 1558), the daughter of Sir William Mallory of Studley, near Ripon in Yorkshire. They had married by 1541 and had seven children, including Sir William Bowes, the heir. George Bowes became head of the Streatlam lordship in co. Durham upon the death of his father in October 1558. He was to prove himself a loyal servant of the crown throughout his career, the high point of which was, undoubtedly, his staunch defence of Barnard Castle, co. Durham, during the northern rising of 1569.<br>
<br>The Bowes family of Streatlam had long participated in the military defence and administration of the Anglo-Scottish border regions and George Bowes was to follow in this tradition. He first gained experience of border conflict during the Scottish wars of the 1540s, with his participation being noted in a raid upon Teviotdale in 1546. Like others of his family he showed particular aptitude in this sphere and he commanded 100 cavalry garrisoned at Douglass in Lothian in 1549. His military capabilities were commended in a dispatch to the privy council that year. During the years of truce, in the early 1550s, Bowes retained his connection with the borders and was named on the commission appointed to oversee the refurbishment of the border fortresses in 1555. Upon the outbreak of war with France in 1557, the government of Mary I took his experience and loyalty into account when considering the state of the once-more vulnerable frontier regions and in January 1558, Bowes was appointed marshal of Berwick. He was knighted there in April 1560.<br>
<br>Border service apart, Bowes's political career remained relatively quiet during the years of the Marian regime. In the summer of 1558 he, now a widower, did seek to advance his prospects through an advantageous marriage on 1 July with Jane Talbot, daughter of Sir John Talbot of Albrighton and Grafton, Worcestershire; they had eight children. She was a kinswoman of the earl of Shrewsbury, lord president of the council of the north. Despite this marriage, his family's close association with protestantism probably inhibited Bowes's political prospects at this time. His uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3058/', "Sir Robert Bowes (1493?&#150;1555)")</script>, had been a member of the extreme reformist administration led by John Dudley, duke of Northumberland, during the reign of Edward VI. Moreover, the Streatlam family's close relationship with the charismatic Scottish reformer John Knox (who had married Bowes's sister, Marjorie, probably in 1555), undoubtedly heightened, further, its identification with overt protestantism.<br>
<br>The accession of Elizabeth I, however, brought about an upturn in George Bowes's political fortunes. Indeed, the decision of the new regime to enforce a protestant settlement of religion, as enshrined in the statutes passed in 1559, provided the staunchly protestant Bowes with the opportunity to prove his indispensability in the administration of the north&#151;a region noted for its strong attachment to the &#145;old religion&#146;. From the early 1560s, his rise to the upper echelons of northern politics was remarkable. In 1561 he was appointed to the council of the north and the ecclesiastical high commission for the province of York. In the following year he was named JP and of the quorum for the bishopric of Durham and the North Riding of Yorkshire and was also appointed sheriff of Yorkshire (1562&#150;3). When, in 1568, Bowes was detailed to attend the &#145;conduction&#146; of Mary, queen of Scots, from Carlisle to Bolton Castle in the North Riding of Yorkshire, Sir Francis Knollys noted, in a letter to Sir William Cecil, the principal secretary, how Bowes, &#145;is also a good Protestant, and his brother [Robert] lykewyse, which is a rare matter in this country&#146;  (Sharp, 379).<br>
<br>The government's faith in Bowes was well placed, as his loyalty during the rising of the northern earls, which erupted in November 1569, was to demonstrate. Indeed, Bowes's heroic defence of Barnard Castle, of which he held the stewardship, did much to provide a focus for loyal northern sentiment in a region that was out of control for several weeks. Moreover, although he was forced to surrender the castle to the rebels after a siege lasting almost two weeks, Bowes's steadfast loyalty was in contrast to that of some of the other leading members of the Durham political &eacute;lite who fled the bishopric. At the outset of and during the rising Bowes was subjected to threats regarding his safety and it is clear that the rebels regarded him with great animosity. As a result they laid waste to several of his properties, including Streatlam Castle. The destruction was considerable and Bowes later complained that, in terms of goods, corn, and cattle, he had lost more than &pound;4000. In the wake of the rising he was appointed by Thomas Radcliffe, third earl of Sussex, as his deputy in co. Durham and Richmondshire and provost marshal. As provost marshal Bowes was responsible for the execution of those rebels condemned to die within the localities. The reputation for cruelty he acquired as a result of this was, largely, undeserved; he may in fact have mitigated the severity of the privy council's original orders. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that he carried out his duties with the diligence of a loyal servant of the crown.<br>
<br>Despite his loyalty, Bowes gained scant reward from the crown for his services. Moreover, the losses he incurred during the rising served only to exacerbate the increasing financial difficulties of his later years. Nevertheless, he continued his career in public life up until his death in 1580, retaining his membership of the council of the north and the northern high commission. He was elected to the parliaments of 1571 and 1572, sitting for the boroughs of Knaresborough, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and Morpeth, Northumberland, respectively, and in 1576 was appointed sheriff of co. Durham. He was added to the commissions of the peace of the East and West Riding of Yorkshire, Cumberland, Northumberland, and Westmorland in 1573. In 1579 he assumed temporary control of Berwick, thereby relieving his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3059/', "Robert Bowes (d. 1597)")</script>, who, as treasurer of the town, undertook day-to-day management of the garrison. However, once more George Bowes's dedication to duty was to cost him dearly, not only in terms of his financial interests but also in terms of his health for he seems to have been dogged by illness for much of his stay in Berwick. Bowes died at Streatlam on 20 August 1580, remaining to the last &#145;the surest pyllore the Quens Majestie had in these partes&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>addenda</i>, <i>1580&#150;1625</i>, 17). He was buried in the family vault of Barnard Castle church.<br>
