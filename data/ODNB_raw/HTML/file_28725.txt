<span class="headword">Wardle,  Gwyllym Lloyd</span>  (1761/2&#150;1833), <span class="occ">soldier and politician</span>, was born at Chester, where he was baptized at St John the Baptist's on 16 January 1762, the only son of Francis Wardle JP, of Hartsheath, near Mold in Flintshire, and his wife, Catherine, daughter and heir of Richard Lloyd Gwyllym of Hartsheath. He was at Harrow School in 1775, but left through ill health. He was afterwards educated in the school of George Henry Glasse at Greenford, near Ealing, Middlesex, and was admitted pensioner at St John's College, Cambridge, on 12 February 1780, but did not take a degree. After travelling on the continent, he settled at Hartsheath. In November 1792 he married Ellen Elizabeth Parry (1766/7&#150;1844), daughter of Love Parry of Madryn, Caernarvonshire, who brought him considerable estates in that county, and to whom he was frequently unfaithful, especially in London; they had seven children. Wardle became a partner of W. A. Madocks in the development of Porthmadog.<br>
<br>When Sir Watkin Williams Wynn raised a troop of dragoons, officially called &#145;the ancient British light dragoons&#146;, and popularly known as &#145;Wynn's lambs&#146;, Wardle served in the troop, accompanied it to Ireland, and is said to have fought at Vinegar Hill. At the Peace of Amiens the troop was disbanded, and Wardle, who desired in vain to be incorporated with the regular forces, retired with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>About 1804 Wardle rented Green Park Place, Bath, and is said by William Farquharson, in a pamphlet on him, to have been concerned in a gin distillery in Jersey. He was resident at Bath when he was elected for Okehampton in 1807; he was at the head of the poll with 113 votes, and is said to have been returned without the support of the borough's patron. He voted against the government in most of the divisions in 1808, and developed an interest in corruption in army contracts, naming Frederick, duke of York. The next year he took this further, introducing the name of the duke's former mistress, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5520/', "Mary Anne Clarke")</script>. His motion led to an investigation by the whole house on 1 February 1809, which lasted until 20 March, with huge public interest focused on the saucy and resourceful Mrs Clarke. With whig support, and despite initial setbacks, Wardle pressed his case and secured the duke's resignation as commander-in-chief, a remarkable achievement for a recently elected back-bencher. He followed up his triumph with a programme of retrenchment, presented in a three-hour speech on 19 June 1809; his resolutions were accepted by ministers who knew they were impractical.<br>
<br>This was the crowning point in Wardle's popularity. The freedom of the City of London was voted to him on 6 April 1809, and congratulatory addresses were presented to him by many corporations throughout the kingdom. A medallion with a striking likeness of him was published by Bisset of Birmingham, and portraits and engravings of him were widely sold. By the following summer his popularity was gone. An upholsterer, Francis Wright, brought an action against him on 3 July for alleged non-payment of a bill for furnishing Mrs Clarke's house. The attorney-general led the prosecution, making clear the government's intention to destroy Wardle. It emerged that he had had negotiations with Mrs Clarke about the duke before launching his parliamentary attack. She alleged he had bought her testimony with a promise to furnish her house. The jury found against him. Wardle brought, on 11 December, an action against the Wrights and Mrs Clarke for conspiracy, but this failed. In 1810 Mrs Clarke's <span class="italic">The Rival Princes</span> portrayed the whole affair as a conspiracy organized by the duke of Kent, with Wardle in his confidence. Charles Williams Wynn gave this assessment of Wardle in August 1810:<blockquote>until last year I had no doubt of his honour or integrity. He had lived certainly rather a debauched life but not more so than many others &hellip; Wardle may be a rogue but I am sure he is also an enthusiast and blinds himself to his own misconduct. (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>)</blockquote>Wardle voted against the duke of York's reinstatement on 11 June 1811, but was not re-elected at the dissolution in 1812 (a Westminster politician named Brooks is said to have raised a subscription of &pound;4000 for him). He withdrew to a farm between Tunbridge Wells and Rochester, taking, as Mrs Clarke said, &#145;to selling milk about Tunbridge&#146;. About 1815, in severe financial difficulties, he went abroad, and settled in Florence. An address, <span class="italic">Colonel Wardle to his Countrymen</span>, arguing for Catholic emancipation, was circulated in 1828; it was dated &#145;Florence, 3 Nov 1827&#146;, and referred to the happy conditions of life in Catholic Tuscany. He died in Florence on 30 November 1833, aged seventy-one, and was buried in the protestant cemetery there.<br>
