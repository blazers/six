<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kelly,  Margaret</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Bluebell]</span>  (1910&#150;2004), <span class="occ">dancer and businesswoman</span>, was born on 24 June 1910 at the Rotunda Hospital, Parnell Street, Dublin, the daughter of James Kelly and Margaret O'Brien. Three weeks after her birth her mother handed her over to a priest, saying she would be going abroad for three months; the baby was put into the care of Mary Murphy, an unmarried dressmaker, and the parents were never seen again. She was a frail child, with spindly legs, who did not walk until after her third birthday; her doctor, struck by her clear blue eyes, called her his little &#145;bluebell&#146;, and that was how she was known for the rest of her life. In 1916 Mary Murphy, who had adopted the child, moved with her to Liverpool, and she grew up in the suburb of West Derby. She attended Leyfield convent school, and at the age of eight started Saturday morning dancing lessons with Mme Cummings in Liverpool, in order to strengthen her legs. She showed such talent that Mme Cummings chose her to be one of the &#145;six little darlings&#146; to perform in the Christmas pantomime <span class="italic">Babes in the Wood</span> in Newquay, Cornwall, when she was twelve. She helped to pay for her dancing lessons by working as a caddy at a golf club, picking potatoes, and delivering milk, and after two years at St Paul's, a local co-educational Catholic school, she left at fourteen to join the Hot Jocks, a Scottish touring company recruiting young dancers to do tap dance routines between performances of traditional ballads. She toured Scotland with the Hot Jocks for nine months, performing in music halls, village halls, and church halls.<br>
<br>In 1925 Kelly was auditioned by Alfred Jackson, a dance company manager, and joined the Jackson Girls, his troupe of thirty chorus girls at the Scala theatre in Berlin, doing high kicks to the beat of a tambourine. The girls performed in Berlin for five months of the year, and she was also a member of his group that toured Europe for the rest of the year. Jackson also had a troupe at the Folies Berg&egrave;re, the first and most famous of the Paris music halls, at a time when music-hall entertainment was at its peak, with spectacular revues featuring exotic stage sets, tableaux of nude showgirls, and lines of chorus girls in lavish costumes with feathers, sequins, and rhinestones, wearing high heels and elaborate headdresses. In the summer of 1930 Bluebell was sent to the Folies Berg&egrave;re as a holiday replacement for a month, and again in 1931, when she was asked to remain permanently as captain of the troupe. A few months after the Alfred Jackson Girls were dismissed, later that year, because the management could no longer afford to pay them, Kelly was invited by Paul Derval, director of the Folies Berg&egrave;re, to form her own troupe of twelve dancers for a new show, <span class="italic">Nuits de folies</span>. The d&eacute;but of the Bluebell Girls, billed on the poster as &#145;The Blue Bell's Girls&#146;, took place on 5 November 1932. Engaged for the following season to perform in <span class="italic">Folies en folies</span>, the Bluebell Girls were sacked after a disagreement with the star, Mistinguett (Jeanne Bourgeois), but were invited back for the 1934&#150;5 season to dance in <span class="italic">Femmes en folie</span>, and appeared in every show, including <span class="italic">En super folies</span> with Josephine Baker in 1936&#150;7, until the Folies Berg&egrave;re closed in 1939 at the beginning of the Second World War.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, after the row with Mistinguett, the Bluebell Girls were offered a job by Jacques-Charles at the new Paramount Cinema in the boulevard des Italiens: &#145;Les Blue Belles Paramount Girls&#146; performed between the film shows. Bluebell managed a troupe there for three years as well as forming her new troupe at the Folies Berg&egrave;re, and in 1935 started a new troupe to tour Italy, and later other European countries, though not Nazi Germany. It was at this point that she decided to engage tall dancers, and made 5 feet 9 inches the minimum height; the average became 5 feet 11 inches. She also decided to recruit mainly English girls, because she thought they were better dancers and would work better as a team. She liked to take sixteen-year-olds, often girls who had been classically trained but had grown too tall for ballet. Although she no longer danced with the girls, concentrating on managing and choreographing the three troupes, she did take part with the Paramount and Folies troupes in a number of musicals filmed in the 1930s, including <span class="italic">D&eacute;d&eacute;</span> (1934), <span class="italic">Avec le sourire</span> (1936) with Maurice Chevalier, and <span class="italic">Barnab&eacute;</span> (1938) with Fernandel.<br>
<br>Kelly married Marcel Leibovici (1904&#150;1961), a Rumanian Jewish musician, leader of the orchestra at the Folies Berg&egrave;re, on 1 March 1939; they had three sons and one daughter. After the outbreak of war, as the Germans advanced on Paris, they attempted to leave France from Bordeaux, but the boats were full and they returned to Paris where in November 1940 she was arrested as an enemy alien and interned in Besan&ccedil;on. She was released on the grounds that although she held a British passport she was born in Ireland, a neutral country, after her husband had persuaded the Irish ambassador to intercede on her behalf. But Leibovici was later arrested himself, as a foreign Jew, and sent to Gurs, a transit camp in the Pyrenees: he escaped, and for two and a half years hid in an attic in Paris, supplied with food by his wife, who bribed the concierge not to betray him. Although the Folies Berg&egrave;re reopened during the German occupation, she refused to perform before a German audience, and survived by managing a troupe of French dancers at the Chantilly theatre in Montmartre, remaining there until 1947.<br>
<br>Although she had returned briefly to the Folies Berg&egrave;re after the liberation of Paris in 1944, Kelly and her Bluebell Girls became permanently associated with the Lido nightclub in the Champs Elys&eacute;es from 1948, when the manager, Pierre Louis-Gu&eacute;rin, invited her to form a troupe. In partnership with Donn Arden, an American choreographer from Las Vegas, she created the spectacular &#145;Paris by Night&#146; dinner shows. The first of these, <span class="italic">Confetti</span>, opened in April 1948, with the Bluebell Girls and the Kelly Boys, a troupe of male dancers (who had to be at least 6 feet 2 inches tall). With her husband acting as business and finance manager, Kelly began to send troupes on tour, extending her organization to Las Vegas, where in 1958 she and Arden opened a version of the Paris Lido show at the Stardust Hotel. By the end of the 1950s they were running a worldwide organization from their headquarters in their flat in Paris, with permanent troupes in Paris and Las Vegas, and other troupes touring all over the world.<br>
<br>After her husband was killed in a car accident in 1961, Kelly took control of the business. When the MGM Grand Hotel opened in Las Vegas in 1974 she was put in charge of over 100 dancers and showgirls in the <span class="italic">Hallelujah Hollywood</span> show, created by Arden. When the hotel reopened in 1981 after having burned down, she and Arden put on <span class="italic">Jubilee</span>, with a cast of 135. The show at the MGM Grand Hotel in Reno, <span class="italic">Hello, Hollywood, Hello</span>, was even more lavish. In Paris the Lido had moved to a former cinema on the Champs Elys&eacute;es and reopened in 1981 with a new show with four groups of Bluebell Dancers, including the topless Bluebell Nude Dancers and the Kelly Boys: Kelly had relaxed her views on nudity and allowed those who wanted to dance topless to do so. She had always been very strict with her girls and worked them very hard, determined that they should be the &eacute;lite among dancers, with an unimpeachable reputation: she vetoed the suggestion in Las Vegas that the girls should mingle with the clientele after the show. According to the ballet dancer Anton Dolin &#145;the Bluebell girls have a quality of their own. They are dignified. You can tell a Bluebell girl just as you can tell a Balanchine or an Ashton ballet&#146;  (Castle, 125). A tough businesswoman, Kelly preferred to work from home rather than have an office at the Lido, to make it clear that it was she who was the girls' employer: they worked for her, and not for the management of the Lido. A perfectionist, she watched both performances of the show at the Lido every evening until her retirement in 1989 and continued to dine once a week at the Lido for many years. She lived in a flat off the Champs Elys&eacute;es and became part of Parisian society.<br>
<br>A television drama series, <span class="italic">Bluebell</span>, based on Kelly's life, was screened in 1986. She took French citizenship in 1948 and was elected a chevalier des arts et des lettres and a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur: she also received a <i>m&eacute;daille d'honneur</i> from the city of Paris. She was appointed OBE in 1996. She died on 11 September 2004 in Paris; she was survived by two sons and a daughter, one son having predeceased her.<br>
