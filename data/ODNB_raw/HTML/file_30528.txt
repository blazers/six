<span class="headword">Bailey <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Westenra]</span>, Dame  Mary</span>, Lady Bailey  (1890&#150;1960), <span class="occ">aviator</span>, was born in London on 1 December 1890, the only daughter and the eldest of three children of Derrick Warner William Westenra, fifth Baron Rossmore (1853&#150;1921), and his wife, Mittie Naylor (<i>d</i>. 1953). On 5 September 1911 she married, as his second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30521/', "Sir Abe Bailey, first baronet (1864&#150;1940)")</script>, a South African mining magnate, financier, and politician. They had three daughters and two sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73847/', "James Richard Abe Bailey (1919&#150;2000)")</script>; the eldest son eventually succeeded his father as third baronet. Lady Bailey took an early interest in aviation and she trained as a pilot with the London aviation club at Stag Lane in 1926, gaining her Royal Aero Club certificate on 26 January 1927. Despite her inexperience, in July 1927 she broke the women's altitude record in a light aircraft by climbing to 17,283 feet in a D. H. Gipsy Moth, taking Mrs Geoffrey de Havilland as a passenger, and she was the first woman to fly across the Irish Sea. She also took a course in navigation. Her almost casual approach to flying showed the benefits of light aircraft for personal travel, and the increasing independence of women, even those with children, was highlighted by her exploits.<br>
<br>On 9 March 1928 she set off from Croydon for a solo flight to South Africa, using a de Havilland Cirrus Moth that had been fitted with additional fuel tanks. Her course lay via Malta, Tripoli, Cairo, and along the Nile to Khartoum, before heading for Tabora in Tanganyika. Unable to find Tabora, she landed to ask the way, and wrecked her machine beyond repair by attempting to leave in gusty conditions. She telegraphed her husband to order another aircraft, which was delivered to her by the South African Air Force twelve days later. She resumed her journey and arrived at Cape Town on 30 April 1928. Contrary to the hopes of her husband, she then decided to make the return flight. Her aircraft was again damaged, and her departure was delayed until 21 September. Her return route was to take her across the Sahara Desert, via Kano in Nigeria, and Dakar in French West Africa. The route had not previously been used, and the Sudanese government forbade women to fly solo, so for that leg of the journey she was accompanied by Captain Bentley of the South African Air Force, who had made a record flight from London to the Cape in 1927. Thick fog delayed her crossing of the channel from France, and she finally arrived back in England on 16 January 1929, a bitterly cold day. &#145;I have just gone to see my husband&#146;, she told reporters at Croydon  (Cluett, 23). She had completed 18,000 miles in the air; for this, in 1930, she was awarded the Britannia trophy, presented for meritorious performance in the air. She was appointed DBE for services to aviation in the same year. Lady Bailey entered the king's cup air race in 1927, 1929, and 1930, and she flew in the international challenge competitions round Europe in 1929 and 1930. Lady Bailey continued to fly for many years, and she settled at Kenilworth, near Cape Town in South Africa after the death of her husband in 1940. She died there on 29 August 1960. A memorial service was held for her at St Clement Danes, Strand, London.<br>
