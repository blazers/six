<span class="headword">Marshall,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1540?), <span class="occ">printer and translator</span>, may have been the William Marshall who in 1527 was a clerk to the chief baron of the exchequer and a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Sir Thomas More. If so, he and his patron soon parted ideological company. By 1533 Marshall had developed an enthusiasm for evangelical religion, and was trying to persuade Thomas Cromwell to put his talents to use in the service of the regime. In that year he completed a translation into English (the first such) of Marsilio of Padua's early fourteenth-century political treatise, <span class="italic">Defensor pacis</span>. Cromwell promised to lend him &pound;20 towards the publication costs but the money was not forthcoming until 1534, and the edition did not eventually arrive until 1535. If Cromwell had misgivings about the project, they seem to have been justified. Two years later, Marshall was pleading his inability to repay the loan on the grounds that the <span class="italic">Defensor pacis</span>, although &#145;the best book in English&#146; against the papacy, had sold poorly  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 11, no. 1355).<br>
<br>This edition was the centrepiece of an array of continental reformist and antipapal propaganda which Marshall published in 1534&#150;5. He does not seem to have established himself firmly in the book trade: his premises in Wood Street are not recorded on any of his colophons, and he used a wide range of printers. His output was dominated by his own translations (notably of Lorenzo Valla's attack on the donation of Constantine) but also included translations by others, for instance one by William Turner of a Latin version of the Swiss reformer Joachim Vadianus's treatise <span class="italic">Vom alten und neuen Gott</span> (1534). He may also have been planning to write against religious conservatism in the University at Oxford, as he asked a correspondent for details of &#145;unreasonable&#146; statutes and the &#145;griefs&#146; with which students were encumbered  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 7, no. 308); both his sons were studying there at the time. His interests extended beyond narrowly religious matters: he produced an edition of the new poor-relief ordinance of Ypres in 1535, and may have been the author of a comprehensive and radical set of proposals for reforming poor relief drawn up for Cromwell at much the same time.<br>
<br>If the <span class="italic">Defensor pacis</span> failed to spark public interest, Marshall's 1535 translation of a Latin version of Martin Bucer's treatise against images, <span class="italic">Das einigerlei Bild</span>, faced the opposite problem. The book provoked an immediate reaction, perhaps because of the additions which Marshall made to the text, such as a call for images to be burnt. Cromwell's agent Thomas Broke and Lord Chancellor Audley both warned Cromwell that Marshall had gone too far, claiming that the book was already causing disquiet and urging that it be banned. Cromwell was more sanguine; the book was permitted to remain, and indeed was in such demand that it was reprinted later the same year. The Yorkshire rebels of 1536 paid Marshall the compliment of naming him as one of five English authors whose heresies should be stamped out.<br>
<br>Marshall's most influential publication, however, was a primer, printed in 1534 and 1535. It was not the first time this traditional devotional text had been recast for evangelical use (his text borrowed freely from George Joye and Martin Luther), but it was the first English primer to have official backing. The semi-official doctrinal formulary of 1537 (the so-called <span class="roman">Bishops' Book</span>) drew heavily on Marshall's text. More significantly, the litany which Marshall introduced in the 1535 edition was the model for Archbishop Cranmer's English litany of 1544, which passed over almost unchanged into the 1549 and 1552 prayer books.<br>
<br>Marshall's personal commitment to these projects is unmistakable. However, Cromwell at least encouraged him, and other scholars vying for government patronage saw Marshall as one of Cromwell's favoured clients. He may also have been connected with Anne Boleyn, to whom he dedicated one of his translations. After 1535 his publishing career petered out: he produced an anonymous translation of a tract by Luther in 1536, and a third edition of his primer in 1538. Perhaps Anne Boleyn's fall sidelined him, or Cromwell may have come to doubt the propaganda value of such heavyweight translations. Marshall did remain in Cromwell's circle; he continued to send reports to the minister, and in 1536 he was one of those sent to persuade the London Carthusians to accept the royal supremacy. He presented them with twenty-four of his unsold copies of the <span class="italic">Defensor pacis</span>; they burnt one copy and returned the rest unread.<br>
<br>Thereafter Marshall fell on hard times. By 1539 he could no longer afford to support his son Richard at Oxford. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18170/', "Richard Marshall")</script> was born in 1517, and there was another son, Thomas; nothing is known of the marriage or of any other children. He is likely to be the William Marshall of St Alban's Wood Street whose death and probate administration is recorded for 1540.<br>
