<span class="headword">Stewart,  Andrew</span>, Lord Avondale  (<em>c.</em>1420&#150;1488), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, appears to have been the eldest son of Walter Stewart (<i>c</i>.1392&#150;1425), second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26499/', "Murdoch Stewart, second duke of Albany (c.1362&#150;1425)")</script>, and Isabella, countess of Lennox (<i>d</i>. 1458/9). His mother's name is uncertain. She may have been a daughter of Sir Duncan Campbell of Loch Awe, but it seems that if the couple were married then their union was not completed according to law. Andrew, together with brothers Arthur and Walter, obtained letters of legitimation from James III in 1472, repeated in 1479. He and his brothers may have fled to Ireland with their mother or stepmother after his father's execution in 1425&#151;as the senior surviving member of the Albany Stewart line, he was not likely to be <i>persona grata</i> with James I. Stewart is first encountered in England in July 1437 with his brother Murdoch, by which time both had been knighted, and he had returned to Scotland by August 1440. In the 1440s, evidently, he was resident with his grandmother, the countess of Lennox, on her estates at or near Inchmurrin, Dunbartonshire.<br>
<br>Stewart chose to make a career at court, however, witnessing there for the first time in 1450. One of the members of the royal entourage who struck down William Douglas, eighth earl of Douglas, on 22 February 1452, he witnessed a number of crown charters in the following months. His absence from charters after the middle of 1452 may indicate that he was keeping a low profile during the period of apparent reconciliation between James II and the ninth earl of Douglas, which lasted until the spring of 1455, though it is also possible that the impression of absence is simply a result of the paucity of royal charters from those years. Shortly after the final defeat of the Black Douglases at Arkinholm on 1 May 1455 Stewart was certainly once more at court. By no later than October 1455 he was created Lord Avondale and thereafter appeared regularly as witness to crown charters. He was keeper of Lochmaben Castle, Dumfriesshire, from about mid-1455 to mid-1460 and warden of the west march from at latest mid-1456. By May 1458 he had become justiciar, a post he held until <i>c</i>.1461. His consolidation of authority culminated in his appointment as chancellor by 4 July 1460. Subsequently his daily activities were those of the king's court, where he was constantly present.<br>
<br>Avondale's role was substantially changed by the death of James II in August 1460, leaving the eight-year-old James III to succeed him. As head of the king's council Avondale inevitably had a senior position during the minority. The Boyd coup and abduction of the king in July 1466 caused particular difficulties. Although Avondale then became keeper of Stirling Castle (and continued to be so until early 1480), he remained loyal to the king and in due course the Boyds were ousted. He was one of the embassy which in 1468 negotiated James's marriage with Margaret, daughter of Christian I of Denmark&#150;Norway. An important part of the settlement was the pledge to Scotland of all Norwegian rights, lands, and revenues in Orkney.<br>
<br>Avondale's loss of office resulted from the crisis of July 1482, when, against the background of a massive English invasion of Scotland, James III was seized at Lauder by a small group of Scottish nobles, fearful of the consequences if the Scottish army met the English forces in battle. Avondale was one of the Scottish leaders who on 2 August negotiated a settlement with the invaders, but following the English withdrawal he was unable to maintain his position in the face of the ambitions of the king's captors, among whom James's half-uncles were prominent, and he was replaced as chancellor that summer. He failed to regain office either after the king was freed in September or when James III re-established control of government the next spring.<br>
<br>Avondale profited surprisingly little, so far as is recorded, from his close proximity to the crown. Apart from the barony of Avondale in Lanarkshire, he was given some lands in Stirlingshire and Perthshire in 1472. But his major benefit was a life-rent gift of the property of the earldom of Lennox, made to him by James III on 4 May 1471. The grant was controversial: the status in law of the earldom after the execution of Earl Duncan in 1425 had never been clearly defined; and in any case there were other claimants, most notably John Stewart, Lord Darnley, who asserted a better right to succeed to the title and most of the lands, and was indeed possessed of the title of earl of Lennox between 1473 and 1476. Avondale may have abused his position to forestall Darnley's claim, though it is worth noting that Avondale was himself a great-grandson of Earl Duncan. He was dead by July 1488, having apparently had no part in the battle of Sauchieburn on 11 June, the set-to between the king and his eldest son which resulted in the king's death. It seems that Avondale was unmarried, and his title became extinct. His nephew Alexander Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1489), son of his brother Walter Stewart of Morphie, inherited the lands of Avondale, and his son Andrew was created Lord Avondale <i>c</i>.1500.<br>
