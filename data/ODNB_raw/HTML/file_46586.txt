<span class="headword">Balfour,  Alexander</span>  (1824&#150;1886), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born on 2 September 1824 at Levenbank, Leven, Fife, Scotland, the eldest son of Henry Balfour, a foundry owner, and his wife, Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bisset. The family had a business background. Alexander was educated locally at Leven parish school, then at Dundee Academy and St Andrews University, and gained his first commercial experience with an uncle in Dundee. His career flourished when he moved to Liverpool, the great centre of nineteenth-century international trade, where he first became a clerk in a small firm which shipped goods to and from Mexico; later he took a job with the partnership of Graham, Kelly &amp; Co. By 1850 he had decided to go into business for himself, and in February 1851 he formed a partnership with two other young clerks from Fife, Stephen Williamson and David Duncan, who were also working for Liverpool merchant houses. The new firm did not have sufficient funds or reputation to trade immediately on its own account, but instead, using borrowed capital from one of Williamson's uncles, the partners shipped manufactures to Chile on consignment or joint account, generally for principals in the United Kingdom. This was a familiar nineteenth-century commercial pattern, which minimized risk (since the partners did not own the goods they shipped) but limited profit, since the firm would earn only a commission income.<br>
<br>Balfour Williamson, as the new firm was styled, was thus typical of many that sprang up in Liverpool to handle the growing volume of British and world trade. The firm was exceptional in the way that it flourished during the next three or four decades, despite a close call in 1857, when a financial crisis threatened its solvency. The partners soon diversified their business. Even when the firm shipped British manufactures on its own account, rather than merely on a commission basis, it was obvious that, given limited purchasing power on the west coast of South America, such a business would never yield a good living. Accordingly, the partners developed a return trade in local primary products. Soon Balfour Williamson owned land on the west coast, received in settlement of debt or purchased as a substitute for holding cash at a time of currency depreciation. The firm also contributed to the diversification and modernization of the Chilean economy. The partners managed local mines, arranged agencies, and floated companies to work concessions in high-risk/high-return infrastructural projects. Balfour Williamson promoted Chilean industrialization by processing primary products, especially in the grain trade, and filled gaps in the local market for complementary business services by investing in warehouses, shipping, and insurance agencies. By 1876 it was one of the largest shipowners on the west coast of South America, with a fleet of more than twenty vessels. Eventually, like many British trading houses, Balfour Williamson entered the world of financial services and merchant banking, supplying mortgages, banking facilities, and loans. The house also diversified geographically along the Pacific coast, developing business interests in Peru and California.<br>
<br>Balfour's contribution to the commercial success of the partnership derived from his prudence and a capacity for hard work typical of Victorian businessmen. His great strengths were attention to detail and careful consideration of issues. Of central importance, too, were his Victorian virtues of integrity and trust which underpinned the firm's reputation for fair dealing. But Balfour was not without his faults. Though he mellowed in later life, he had a hasty temper which frequently got the better of him, contributing in no small way to the dispute with Duncan which subsequently split the partnership. Duncan accused Balfour of mismanagement and left the firm in 1863 to join what became Duncan Fox, one of Balfour Williamson's main rivals in Chile. Williamson was also a scathing critic of his partner's business acumen. Balfour was unsuited to Chile, where flexibility and imagination were needed. He visited that country only on tours of duty between 1860 and 1868 and he left much of the overseas business to the more daring Williamson. Nevertheless, Williamson, increasingly regarded as the head of the firm, recognized his partner's solid qualities, since it was he who, in 1863, made the crucial choice between Balfour and Duncan&#151;in Balfour's favour.<br>
<br>Outside business Balfour used his accumulated wealth and reputation as a devout Christian and committed philanthropist to support the temperance cause, the welfare of children, and improved conditions for seamen. In 1864 he married Mary Jessie (<i>d</i>. 1923), the third daughter of the Revd Roxburgh, with whom he had at least four children. During the 1870s he represented St Peter's ward on Liverpool city council and served as a JP for Denbighshire but, unlike his partner, Williamson, would not stand for parliament. He bought a country estate, Mount Alyn, at Rossett&#151;south of Chester, but close enough for contact with Liverpool, since he did not retire&#151;and there he indulged his taste for painting and music. However, ill health, the untimely death of his eldest son, and depression seem to have troubled his later years, and he died at Mount Alyn on 16 April 1886, shortly after an unsuccessful operation to remove a cancerous growth.<br>
