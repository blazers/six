<span class="headword">Paschall,  Andrew</span>  (1631?&#150;1696), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and advocate for a universal language</span>, was born in Soper Lane, London. He matriculated at Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1647, proceeding BA in 1651, MA in 1654, and BD in 1661. A fellow of Queens' from 1653 to 1663, he was a university preacher from January 1658. He was obliged to demand readmittance to his fellowship at the Restoration, which was granted in August 1660. Three years later he resigned it when presented to the living of Chedzoy in Somerset, by Sir Francis Rolle. Here he remained until 1689 when he moved first to Bristol and thence to Wells as chancellor of the cathedral (25 March 1689), prebendary (25 December 1690), and canon residentiary (September 1693).<br>
<br>At Cambridge, Paschall had connections with the Cambridge Platonists through John Smith, fellow and later dean of Queens', or John Worthington. From them he derived an insistent rationality and a commitment to learning as a way of recovering true, pre-lapsarian knowledge which would heal religious schism and its resultant social disorder. Paschall was imbued with the idea that man's duty to God meant that he must labour for moral and social improvement. His favoured tool for effecting such social reform through learning was the universal language of John Wilkins in the mastering, improving, and propagation of which he spent several decades.<br>
<br>Paschall's research into a universal language was carried out in the context of group activity on the subject orchestrated by John Aubrey in a circle of correspondents that included Paschall himself, Francis Lodowick, Robert Hooke, John Ray, and Thomas Piggott. Inspired by this and by the Royal Society, Paschall, in association with Joseph Glanvill, tried to establish a &#145;Clubb for Philosophicall Correspondence&#146; in Somerset. Although this functioned only briefly, in 1669&#150;70, Paschall continued to pursue its twin aims of promoting a universal language and amassing observations for a general natural history. In the 1680s he proposed the writing of a natural history of Somerset modelled on the county natural histories produced by Robert Plot. Although nothing came of such projects, and Paschall himself published nothing, his career reveals the force of the intellectual, idealistic social reform movement of the century, in Paschall's case interestingly combined with a staunch church tory political position. Thanks to his influence Chedzoy, despite being close to the centre of the uprising sparked in the summer of 1685 by James Scott, duke of Monmouth, supplied few, if any, recruits to the duke's army. However, Paschall was sufficiently impressed by the momentous events in his neighbourhood to write two accounts of the battle of Sedgemoor. One of these, published in Samuel Heywood's <span class="italic">A Vindication of Mr Fox's History of the Reign of James II</span> (1811), is relatively well known; the second appeared in <span class="italic">Somerset and Dorset Notes and Queries</span> (vol. 28, 1961&#150;7). A plan of the battlefield that he drew (preserved in Bodl. Oxf., Ballard MSS) has been much reproduced. In August 1694 Paschall was appointed steward for two years at Wells, and he died soon after the term of this office, before November 1696.<br>
