<span class="headword">Morgan, Sir  Frederick Edgworth</span>  (1894&#150;1967), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Paddock Wood, near Tonbridge, Kent, on 5 February 1894, the eldest son in a family of nine children of Frederick Beverley Morgan (<i>d</i>. 1934), a timber importer and merchant from a line of timber merchants, of Mascalls, Paddock Wood, and West Pallant House, Chichester, and his wife, Clara Elizabeth, daughter of Edgworth Horrocks, squire of Paddock Wood, Kent. Morgan was educated at Hurstleigh private school, Tunbridge Wells (1902&#150;7), Clifton College (1907&#150;11)&#151;where he was a successful cricketer and cadet commander of the Officers' Training Corps&#151;and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich (1912&#150;13), before being commissioned second lieutenant, Royal Field Artillery, on 17 July 1913. He returned from India with the Lahore divisional artillery in 1914 and served in France and Belgium throughout the war, taking part in most of the major battles and being twice mentioned in dispatches and promoted captain in 1916. Early in the war he was blown up and suffered severe shell-shock, but he returned later to serve on the staff of the Canadian Corps. On 15 August 1917 he married Marjorie Cecile, daughter of Colonel Thomas du B&eacute;dat Whaite, of the Army Medical Service; they had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>From 1919 to early 1935 Morgan served with his regiment in India (major 1932, brevet lieutenant-colonel 1934), where he did much pigsticking and was a keen cricketer. He attended the Staff College, Quetta, in 1927&#150;8, and held staff appointments in India and at the War Office (general staff officer, grade 2 (GSO 2), Royal Artillery, India, 1931&#150;4; GSO 2, War Office, 1936&#150;8). He later described his term at Whitehall as a nightmare as there was so little sense of urgency to prepare for the impending war.<br>
<br>Promoted colonel in 1938 and temporary brigadier in 1939, Morgan was for a short period GSO 1 to the 3rd division (1938&#150;9); but he was then given command of the support group of the 1st armoured division, with which he went to France in 1940. During the retreat of the British expeditionary force he took part in the fighting south of the Somme, and escaped from Brest. Between 1940 and 1943 he held appointments at home culminating in the command of 1st corps (1942&#150;3), and in 1942 he was promoted acting lieutenant-general. In March 1943 he was appointed COSSAC (chief of staff to the supreme allied commander [designate]). He was faced with the gigantic task of planning the invasion of north-west Europe and a follow-up attack into the heart of Germany with an eventual force of 100 divisions, and also a deception scheme (Cockade) to keep the Germans alert for landings in 1943. He set up his headquarters at Norfolk House in St James's Square where he assembled an Anglo-American staff of all three services. Although a number of studies for a landing on the coast of Normandy had already been made, Morgan and his team faced enormous difficulties. The chief of the Imperial General Staff, Sir Alan Brooke, after outlining the problem is alleged to have remarked &#145;Well, there it is. It won't work, but you must bloody well make it.&#146; If in the end Morgan failed to provide a plan which satisfied the eventual executants, they could not have managed without it. He devoted himself tirelessly to the task, working seven days a week and sleeping beside his desk. The happy relations he fostered in his inter-allied staff was a remarkable achievement in view of the misunderstandings and differences of opinion sometimes prevalent between the allies on a higher level.<br>
<br>The inadequacies of COSSAC's planning in 1943 and early 1944 were principally due to two factors: the absence of a supreme commander and the shortage of means then available. Despite the representations made by Churchill and the British chiefs of staff at the Quebec conference in August 1943, it was not until after the appointment of General Eisenhower and his deputy commanders at the end of 1943 that the Americans fully grasped the size of the problem and began to make provision for it. The planners' most acute difficulty was undoubtedly the lack of a sufficient number of landing-craft (the Pacific theatre and to some extent the Mediterranean then enjoyed a higher priority), but there were many other serious deficiencies, including ships and aircraft for lifting airborne troops. When Churchill showed General Montgomery a draft of COSSAC's plan at Marrakesh at the end of December 1943, the latter submitted a trenchant memorandum arguing that in its present form it was impracticable. In particular Montgomery pointed out that the allocation of only three infantry divisions for the initial landing would entail far too narrow a front: &#145;By D + 12 a total of 16 divisions have been landed on the same beaches as were used for the initial landings. This would lead to the most appalling confusion on the beaches, and the smooth development of the land battle would be made extremely difficult&#151;if not impossible.&#146; Montgomery significantly extended the scope of the landings and also strengthened the command structure; his plan called for an attack by two armies side by side, British Second Army on the left with three divisions in line, and US First Army on the right with two divisions. Montgomery himself held the executive command of the twenty-first army group, under Eisenhower's supreme direction, until after the break-out was achieved.<br>
<br>Nevertheless the great expansion of the forces available for Overlord and the consequent modifications of the plan in the first five months of 1944 should not obscure the fact that COSSAC and his staff had laid the essential foundations for the greatest amphibious operation ever undertaken. Among the many novel features of Morgan's plan perhaps the most remarkable and successful was the provision for large-scale maintenance from artificial harbours (Mulberries). Montgomery later wrote that Morgan &#145;did a good job &hellip; and produced an outline plan for OVERLORD which served as a basis for future planning&#146;  (Montgomery, 219). Eisenhower later wrote that Morgan made D-day possible.<br>
<br>When, early in 1944, Morgan was relieved on the arrival of the British and American commanders with their own chiefs of staff, he was appointed deputy chief of staff at Eisenhower's headquarters (SHAEF). His advice to the supreme commander frequently conflicted with the views of Montgomery, who later wrote of Morgan in his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> that &#145;He considered Eisenhower was a god; since I had discarded many of his plans, he placed me at the other end of the celestial ladder&#146;  (Montgomery, 256).<br>
<br>In September 1945 Morgan took on probably the most difficult and ultimately most unhappy assignment of his career as chief of operations in Germany to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). During the next year he applied his qualities of drive, intelligence, and sympathy to the desperate problems presented by at least a million displaced persons. Although remarkably successful in some aspects of his work, he soon became disillusioned with UNRRA, which he believed was being exploited by sinister organizations. In January 1946 he created a furore by asserting at a press conference that a secret organization existed to further a mass movement of Jews out of Europe. Although his suspicion was possibly well founded, critics held that he should not have made a public statement while officially concerned with provision for numerous Jewish refugees. Six months later he was dismissed after alleging that UNRRA organizations were being used as a cover for Soviet agents who were fomenting trouble among displaced persons. This episode is related in full and strikes an uncharacteristically bitter note in Morgan's autobiography.<br>
<br>Freddie Morgan was a tall, cheerful soldier with a fresh complexion and blue eyes. Behind a somewhat untidy appearance and a droll sense of humour he concealed one of the sharpest minds of his generation in the army. His charm and courtesy were invaluable assets in a senior staff officer, yet he also had a strong personality and great courage in voicing unpopular views. Throughout his career he displayed ability and competence well above the average.<br>
<br>In 1946 Morgan retired from the army with the honorary rank of lieutenant-general. In 1951 he succeeded Lord Portal of Hungerford as controller of atomic energy, and witnessed Britain's first atomic tests at the Monte Bello Islands in October 1952; and in 1954&#150;6 he was controller of atomic weapons under the Atomic Energy Authority. He published his account of the work of the COSSAC team, <span class="italic">Overture to Overlord</span> (1950), and his autobiography <span class="italic">Peace and War, a Soldier's Life</span> (1961).<br>
<br>He was appointed CB in 1943 and promoted KCB in 1944, and received US and French honours. He was a colonel-commandant, Royal Artillery, from 1948 to 1958. Morgan died at Mount Vernon Hospital, Northwood, Middlesex, on 19 March 1967.<br>
