<span class="headword">Ingrams,  (William) Harold</span>  (1897&#150;1973), <span class="occ">colonial official</span>, was born on 3 February 1897, at The Schools, Kingsland, Shrewsbury, the son of the Revd William Smith Ingrams (1853&#150;1939), an assistant master at Shrewsbury School (1883&#150;1921), and his wife, Gertrude Mary Payne (1870/71&#150;1947). Ingrams was educated at Shrewsbury School (1910&#150;14) and in the First World War served as a subaltern in the King's Shropshire light infantry on the western front. In Belgium in 1916 he was wounded, and subsequently worked as a temporary civil servant at the Ministry of National Service. His wound left him permanently lame, though he made light of it and led an active life. He married, on 10 April 1918, Phyllis (1898&#150;1982), daughter of Frederick Lofthouse Mulgrave, merchant.<br>
<br>In 1919 Ingrams entered the colonial service and was appointed assistant district commissioner in Zanzibar: in 1925 he was promoted second assistant secretary. His varied tasks included organizing for the sultan a picnic for British naval officers and in 1924 accompanying the sultan to the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley. In 1927 he was awarded fourth class of the order of the Brilliant Star, Zanzibar. He enjoyed friendly relations with local Arabs and acquired a lasting interest in the Arab world.<br>
<br>From 1927 to 1933 Ingrams was assistant colonial secretary in Mauritius, where white ants ate his pictures, books, and furniture. His first marriage ended in divorce. On 3 June 1930 he married at the Savoy Chapel, London, Doreen Constance Shortt (1906&#150;1997) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67156/', "Ingrams, Doreen Constance")</script>], an actress, the youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36078/', "Edward Shortt (1862&#150;1935)")</script>, a lawyer and politician; they had one daughter and one adopted Arab daughter.<br>
<br>In 1934 Ingrams went to Aden as political officer. From 1934 he journeyed, partly by camel and donkey, in the Hadhramaut, the hinterland of Aden&#151;then little known to Europeans, and backward with slavery, armed feuding, and stinking insanitary villages&#151;and reported on conditions there. From 1937 to 1940 he was British resident adviser at Mukalla, capital of the Qa'iti sultanate, in the eastern Aden protectorate. Later described by James Lunt as &#145;a strong man, with a deep understanding of the Arab psychology&#146;  (Lunt, 103), he negotiated a truce, known as the Ingrams peace, by which the tribes agreed to end their internecine warfare. He became known as Al Muslahi, &#145;the settler [of disputes]&#146;, and numerous fathers offered him their daughters in marriage. He encouraged the sultan to modernize his state by road building among other measures, and the sultan bestowed on him the title Friend of Hadhramaut and made him a pasha. According to his wife, he had &#145;quite uncolonial ideas&#146;  (D. Ingrams, 69) on how the Hadhramaut should be developed, with minimal British personnel and intervention, and he wrote: &#145;It is an Arab country and Arab it must remain&#146;  (H. Ingrams, <span class="italic">Arabia and the Isles</span>, 354). In 1938 he visited Major Glubb's desert patrol of the Arab Legion in Transjordan, and modelled on it the Hadhrami Bedouin legion, with former Arab Legion NCOs and the red-and-white shamagh of the Arab Legion.<br>
<br>Ingrams wore quasi-Arab dress&#151;which he claimed was more comfortable and practical and was considered a compliment by the local people&#151;and insisted his British staff did likewise. This was a debatable practice, criticized by the Dutch traveller Colonel van der Meulen, who visited them, as &#145;disguised Englishmen &hellip; a masquerade&#146;  (van der Meulen, 239&#150;40), false to oneself and one's origins. <span class="italic">The Times</span> later commented that &#145;nothing could in fact have been more English than the burly figure and the quizzical blue eyes under a shock of white hair&#146;  (12 Dec 1973, 19). Ingrams was awarded an OBE in 1933 and a CMG in 1939. In 1939 he made a tour of Malaya to study the adviser system, and visited Hadhrami immigrants there and in Java and Hyderabad. He was acting governor of Aden in 1940, and continued to serve in various senior posts in Aden and the protectorate until 1945. In 1939 he and his wife were jointly awarded the Lawrence memorial medal of the Royal Central Asian Society, and in 1940 the founder's medal of the Royal Geographical Society. In 1942 he published his account of his life in Zanzibar, Mauritius, and south Arabia, <span class="italic">Arabia and the Isles</span>.<br>
<br>From 1945 to 1947 Ingrams was seconded as assistant secretary to the Allied Control Commission for Germany (British element). It was not untypical of the Colonial Office for Ingrams, an Arab expert with minimal African experience, to be transferred in 1947 from Arabia to sub-Saharan Africa, as chief commissioner of the northern territories of the Gold Coast. He drove there with his family and others, across the Sahara, and described their journey in <span class="italic">Seven across the Sahara</span> (1949), an unexciting travelogue praising French colonial officials and calling for Anglo-French co-operation in Africa. He was not entirely happy in his new post, and he retired from the colonial service in 1948. However, he continued to work for the Colonial Office in various advisory roles, finally retiring in 1968. He was a prolific writer, and his publications included a history of Zanzibar, official reports, textbooks, and pamphlets; he also broadcast. His second marriage was dissolved, and on 3 September 1960 he married Henrietta Kathleen (1904&#150;1983), whose marriage to William Box had been dissolved; she was the daughter of William Wise, analytical chemist.<br>
<br>Charming, genial, humorous, and a slightly eccentric &#145;character&#146;, Ingrams lived latterly at Uphousden, near Ash next Sandwich, Canterbury, Kent, and died on 9 December 1973 at the South Western Hospital, Stockwell, Lambeth.<br>
