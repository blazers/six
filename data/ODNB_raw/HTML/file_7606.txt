<span class="headword">Dickinson,  John</span>  (1815&#150;1876), <span class="occ">writer on India</span>, was the only surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94145/', "John Dickinson (1782&#150;1869)")</script>, an eminent paper maker of Nash Mills, Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire&#151;who with Henry Fourdrinier first patented a process for manufacturing paper of an indefinite length, and so met the increasing demands of the newspaper press&#151;and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Grover (1789&#150;1874). He was born on 28 December 1815 at Nash House, Apsley, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. He was educated at Eton College, and afterwards briefly worked in his father's business. He had, however, no taste either for accounts or for mechanical processes. Being in delicate health, he left England in 1839 to travel on the continent, where, with occasional visits to his friends at home, he spent several years studying languages, art, and foreign politics. His sympathies were entirely given to the struggling liberal party on the continent, on whose behalf he wrote desultory essays in periodicals of no great note. He was in Paris during the revolution of 1848, and wrote a series of letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> describing his experiences and analysing the events.<br>
<br>It was not until 1850 that Dickinson found his vocation as an independent Indian reformer. His uncle Colonel (later General) Thomas Dickinson, of the Bombay Engineers, and his cousin Sebastian Stewart Dickinson encouraged and assisted him in this enterprise. Dickinson criticized the Indian government's apathy in improving communications, thereby inhibiting the growth of commerce, and its excessive zeal under the administration of Lord Dalhousie in expanding British political control at the expense of the princely states. In these areas, he believed, reforms were needed. In 1850 and 1851 a series of letters appeared in <span class="italic">The Times</span> on the best means of increasing the produce and promoting the supply to English manufacturing towns of Indian cotton. These were from Dickinson's pen, and were afterwards published as <span class="italic">Letters on the Cotton and Roads of Western India</span> (1851). A public works commission was appointed by Lord Dalhousie the next year to inquire into the deficiencies of administration pointed out by Dickinson and his friends.<br>
<br>On 12 March 1853 a meeting was held in Dickinson's rooms in Charles Street, St James's Square, London, and a society was formed under the name of the India Reform Society. The debate in parliament that year on the renewal of the East India Company's charter gave the society and Dickinson, as its honorary secretary, constant occupation. Already in 1852 the publication of Dickinson's <span class="italic">India, its Government under a Bureaucracy</span>&#151;a small volume of 209 pages&#151;had produced a marked effect. It was reprinted in 1853 as one of a series of <span class="roman">India Reform Tracts</span>, and had a very large circulation. The maintenance of good faith and goodwill to the princely states was the substance of all these writings. Public attention was diverted from the subject for a time by the Crimean War, but was roused again in 1857 by the Indian mutiny. Dickinson worked incessantly throughout the two years of the uprising and pacification, and afterwards, when the transfer of the Indian government from the company to the crown was carried into effect. He attempted to moderate public excitement, and to prevent exclusive attention to penal and repressive measures. To this end he organized a series of well-attended public meetings. After 1859 the India Reform Society began to languish, and at a meeting in 1861 John Bright resigned the chairmanship, which he had assumed in 1855; a unanimous vote appointed Dickinson his successor. Dickinson married Alicia Martha Bicknell (<i>d</i>. 1875) in 1859 and family affairs occupied more of his time. In 1863 he began to study law and was called to the bar. But he retained his interest in the princely states. The publication in 1864&#150;5 of two pamphlets entitled <span class="italic">Dhar not Restored</span> roused in Calcutta a feeling of great indignation against the writer, Dickinson, who was stigmatized as a &#145;needy adventurer&#146;.<br>
<br>On the death of his father in 1869 Dickinson inherited a large fortune and was much occupied in the management of his property. By then the India Reform Society had become inactive. Still, despite being in weak health from heart disease, he kept alive to the last his interest in India, corresponding with Holkar, maharaja of Indore, with great regularity. He indignantly repelled the accusation made against Holkar, in the affair of Colonel Durand, namely, that the maharaja had acted equivocally towards the British during the uprising in 1857, when his troops mutinied, attacked the residency, and forced the resident, H. M. Durand, to retreat from Indore.<br>
<br>In 1872 Dickinson was deeply grieved by the death of his youngest son, and in 1875 felt still more deeply the loss of his wife, whom he did not long survive. On 23 November 1876 he was found dead in his study, at 1 Upper Grosvenor Street, London. From the papers lying on the table it was evident that he had been engaged in writing a reply to Holkar's assailants; this was afterwards completed and published by his friend Major Evans Bell under the title of <span class="italic">Last Counsels of an Unknown Counsellor</span> (1877). He was buried at Kings Langley, Hertfordshire. Dickinson was survived by two sons, John Ehret (1860&#150;1896) and Thomas Gordon (1862&#150;1908), and by the elder of his two sisters, Frances Elizabeth Pratt Barlow (1814&#150;1881).<br>
