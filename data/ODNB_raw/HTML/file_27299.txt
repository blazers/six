<span class="headword">Thomson,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1607, <em>d.</em> 1691), <span class="occ">merchant and politician</span>, was baptized on 12 April 1607 at Watton-at-Stone, Hertfordshire, the second son of Robert Thomson (1570&#150;<i>c</i>.1638), and his wife, Elizabeth Halfhead 
    (or Harsnett; <i>bap</i>. 1579, <i>d</i>. after 1622)
  , and younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38061/', "Maurice Thomson")</script>, colonial merchant. He emigrated to Virginia in 1623, was elected to the Virginia house of burgesses for Elizabeth county, and became a lieutenant and JP. He returned to London and traded with St Kitts, Montserrat, and New England, and with Virginia, where he sent emigrants and accumulated land. In the 1640s he helped intrude the radical John Simpson as lecturer in St Dunstan's parish, and was appointed a lay trier and a member of the tenth London classis, for St Olave's parish, Southwark. A captain of horse under the earl of Bedford during the first civil war, he rose to command a London regiment of horse. He served under Waller at Basing House and lost a leg at the battle of Cheriton (29 March 1644), replacing it with a wooden one. In October 1644 he supported a petition in favour of Colonel Sam Jones retaining his command at Farnham, an act subsequently voted a breach of privilege. Recruited MP for Southwark in 1645, the following year he was accused of outspoken words against Lord Mayor Adams for the latter's reception of a letter from the king.<br>
<br>Thomson was a witness to the battle of Maidstone in 1648, and sat on the militia and assessment committees for a number of south-eastern counties. As an MP in the Rump Parliament he dealt with the planter petitions from the Caribbean. He served as chairman of the Rump's navy committee and as such was to the fore in reporting to parliament on the financial reorganization of the navy, and reported the act for imposing customs duties on tobacco imported through New England. Appointed to the council of state in 1651, he was one of the six-strong commission to reorganize the navy during the First Anglo-Dutch War and travelled to the Downs to supervise the fleet. He protested at the dissolution of the Rump Parliament and was later imprisoned for conspiracy against Cromwell. In 1659 he returned to the council of state, his local committee roles, and his position as a naval commissioner, in which role he put pressure on the East India Company for a loan to the restored republic.<br>
<br>Thomson lived at Lee in Kent, purchased 4000 acres of Irish land, and married thrice, with Elizabeth Brickland of Thorncliffe, Cheshire, Elizabeth Humphries of Surrey, and Abigail Barnes of Barking, Essex. He was the father of George, Elizabeth, and Mary. In 1661 he was under suspicion of involvement with the Fifth Monarchists and of supporting seditious sermons at Lee, and was briefly arrested. In 1667 he was nominated to the 1668&#150;9 committee named by parliament to investigate the commissioners of the navy for failure in the Second Anglo-Dutch War, and in January 1670 accused Pepys of insufficient eagerness in the purchase of English plank. He died in Clerkenwell in January 1691 and was buried at St Olave's, Southwark.<br>
<br>George Thomson's youngest brother, <a name="cosubject_65805"></a><span class="headword">Robert Thomson</span>  (1622&#150;1694), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, had emigrated to Massachusetts in the 1630s, where he purchased the old Boston meeting-house. He returned to England and became a major in a London regiment, serving as rear-admiral in the 1642 &#145;sea adventure&#146; expedition to Ireland. Apparently a presbyterian, he was purged from the London militia committee in 1648 though &#145;a valiant and faithful commander&#146;  (Liu, 60). In 1649 he was appointed a commissioner to regulate the navy and the customs, and to the commission for propagating the gospel in New England. In the 1640s he was engaged in the East Indies trade and was active in his brother Maurice's Assada adventure. He acted as a commissioner in disputes between patentees for Connecticut and Rhode Island and was reputed to have offered &pound;13,000 for New York. In 1663 Pepys said he talked &#145;very highly of liberty of conscience, which now he hopes for by the King's declaration&#146;  (Pepys, 4, 5). He represented the East India Company at the 1667 treaty of Breda and in negotiations for the purchase of Bombay. Elected deputy governor, he was involved in secret discussions with the crown over trade to Japan and the East, and was a supporter of Increase Mather's plans for New England. With his wife, Frances, he had six children, and he died at Stoke Newington in 1694.<br>
