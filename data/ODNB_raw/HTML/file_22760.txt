<span class="headword">Price,  Owen</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1671), <span class="occ">schoolmaster</span>, was born in Montgomeryshire. He was made a scholar of Jesus College, Oxford, by the parliamentary visitors in October 1648, and he matriculated on 12 March 1649. He remained at the university for four years before taking a job as a schoolmaster in Wales, where &#145;he advanced his scholars much in presbyterian principles&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.942). He eventually returned to Oxford to finish his education, graduating BA, and proceeding MA by accumulation from Christ Church on 6 May 1656. In 1657 he succeeded William Wroth as master of Magdalen College School, &#145;where by his industry and good way of teaching, he drew many youths of the city, whose parents were fanatically given, to be his scholars&#146;  (ibid.). He apparently supplemented his income by teaching out-college boys as well as his regular pupils.<br>
<br>On 21 June 1658 Price sent a letter to Henry Scobell, secretary of Oliver Cromwell's council, to complain about the delay in making him master of Westminster School in succession to Richard Busby. The delay &#145;has disswaded several persons from sending their children to me&#146;, he writes, and &#145;I fear that I shall suffer by it very much&#146;  (Peck, 502). He challenges his detractors to &#145;let any scholars in Oxon be appointed to make a tryall of my boyes here [Magdalen]&#146;  (ibid.). His candidacy for Busby's position does not appear to have been successful. At the Restoration Price was ejected from his position at Magdalen for nonconformity, and he taught subsequently in Devon and Besselsleigh, Oxfordshire, where he became &#145;useful among the brethren, and a noted professor in the art of pedagogy&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.942).<br>
<br>Price's first book, <span class="italic">The Vocal Organ</span> (1665), comprises a 35-page primer and a 29-page praxis, as well as brief sections on calligraphy, punctuation, and arithmetic. In the primer Price adapts the phonetic system of John Wallis, author of <span class="italic">Grammatica linguae Anglicanae</span> (1653), to the teaching of spelling. Price's method is to have students master the pronunciation of letters before they are introduced to fifty-six spelling rules. The praxis is a collection of alphabetically arranged verses &#145;to difference the words of like sound&#146;  (p. 47), such as <i>ant</i>-<i>aunt</i>, <i>earn</i>-<i>yarn</i>, and <i>sought</i>-<i>soft</i>. In his preface Price claims that he was not &#145;guided by our vulgar pronunciation, but by that of London and our Universities&#146;, but it has been suggested that some of Price's pronunciations betray the time he spent in Devon. <span class="italic">The Vocal Organ</span> contains the first illustration of the organs of speech (lips, teeth, palate, tongue, throat) in an English book.<br>
<br>Price's second book, <span class="italic">English Orthography</span> (1668), is a major revision of <span class="italic">The Vocal Organ</span>. Price abandons Wallis's phonetic system and presents his spelling rules in a question and answer format; he replaces the verses in the praxis with a table of homophones, or near homophones, and their definitions. In a second edition (1670) he adds a list of frequently misspelt words. His lists are derived largely from earlier spelling books, such as Richard Hodges's <span class="italic">A Special Help to Orthographie</span> (1643) and Jeremiah Wharton's <span class="italic">The English Grammar</span> (1654), and they were, in turn, included in many later spelling books, such as George Fox and Ellis Hookes's <span class="italic">Instructions for Right Spelling</span> (1670).<br>
<br>On 2 July 1657 Price was married in Oxford to Lydia, daughter of John Blagrave of Merton College. Their children included John (<i>b</i>. 1659), Samuel (<i>b</i>. 1664), and possibly Martha (<i>b</i>. 1669). Joseph Foster mentions another son, Thomas, who graduated BA in 1693 and MA in 1695 at Oxford. These dates seem rather late for a son of Price's; however, the register of St Peter-in-the-East does record the baptism of a Thomas Price on 21 May 1672, approximately six months after Owen's death. According to Wood, Price died in his house near Magdalen on 25 November 1671 and was buried two days later in &#145;the church of S. Peter, in the East, near to the door leading into the belfry&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.943). On 4 December 1671 an Oxford court ordered that no action should be taken on Price's goods, mentioning the name of a possible creditor, Henry Hodges. The administration of Price's effects did not take place until 13 December 1676; his widow Lydia was still living at the time. An inventory of his goods and chattels, dated 15 February 1677, shows his wealth to have been a little more than &pound;298, most of which was derived from a lease granted by the president and fellows of Magdalen College.<br>
