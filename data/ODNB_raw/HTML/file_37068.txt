<span class="headword">Yorke,  Warrington</span>  (1883&#150;1943), <span class="occ">parasitologist</span>, was born at Lancaster on 11 April 1883, the eldest of the six children of the Revd Henry Lefroy Yorke, a Wesleyan Methodist minister, and his wife, Margaret Warrington. He attended University School, Southport, and Epworth College, Rhyl, before studying medicine at Liverpool University. Here he was awarded the Senior Lyon Jones scholarship and the Derby exhibition in clinical medicine. He qualified MB ChB in 1905, MD in 1907, and MRCP in 1929; he was elected FRCP in 1934. In 1906 he was elected to the Holt fellowship in physiology and worked under Charles Scott Sherrington, at whose suggestion he joined the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in 1907. Two years later he was sent with Wakelin Barratt to Nyasaland to investigate twenty cases of blackwater fever. On his return in 1909 he was appointed research assistant to Anton Breinl at the Liverpool school's Runcorn laboratory, and he became its director a few months later.<br>
<br>During 1911 and 1912 Yorke was in Northern Rhodesia on the British South Africa Company's sleeping sickness commission. He showed that the tsetse fly, <i>Glossina morsitans</i>, was the transmitter of Rhodesian sleeping sickness, and that wild animals formed a reservoir of the infection. This work was carried out almost simultaneously with the researches of Sir David Bruce in Nyasaland. From 1914 until 1929 Yorke was Walter Myers professor of parasitology and from 1929 until his death he was the Alfred Jones professor of tropical medicine at Liverpool. He was honorary assistant physician for tropical diseases in the Liverpool Royal Infirmary from 1920 to 1929 and full honorary physician from 1929 to 1943. In 1916 he married Elizabeth Annie Greening; they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Yorke's work on the trypanosomes and nematodes, and his later work on the chemotherapy of parasitic diseases, earned him an international reputation. He was very active in societies and committees, twice serving as vice-president of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. In 1927 he served on the chemotherapy committee of the Medical Research Council, and in 1935 he was on the malaria commission of the League of Nations. He was awarded the Chalmers memorial gold medal of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in 1925 for his services to tropical medicine, and he was elected FRS in 1932.<br>
<br>In the Second World War, Yorke served in the Royal Army Medical Corps and was stationed in Malta, where he conducted courses for service medical officers going abroad to tropical countries. Yorke was the author of a monograph on <span class="italic">The Nematode Parasites of Vertebrates</span> (1926) in collaboration with Philip Alan Maplestone, and of some 165 reports and papers, the majority of which appeared in the <span class="italic">Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology</span>. His researches contributed greatly to a better understanding of tropical diseases.<br>
<br>Yorke was vivacious, direct, and questioning. Casual observers found him coldly analytical, but friends and colleagues knew him as kind and helpful. The <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> described him as the &#145;fountain-head and moving spirit&#146; of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 585). Yorke died at his home, 4 Bryanston Road, Prenton, Birkenhead, on 24 April 1943 and was survived by his wife.<br>
