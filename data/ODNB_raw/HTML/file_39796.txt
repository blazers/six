</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ayer, Sir  Alfred Jules <span class="st"> [Freddie]</span></span>  (1910&#150;1989), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born on 29 October 1910 at Neville Court, Abbey Road, north-west London, the only child of Jules Louis Cyprien Ayer, financier, later in the timber trade, who came from a Swiss Calvinist family, and his wife, Reine Citro&euml;n, who came from a Dutch Jewish family, associated with the Citro&euml;n car manufacturer. He had no religious upbringing, and his childhood years, which he described as solitary, were spent in London. At the age of seven he was sent to Ascham, at Eastbourne, and from there went on, first to Eton College as a scholar, and then, in 1929, with an open scholarship in classics, to Christ Church, Oxford. Choosing not to read classical honour moderations, he obtained in 1932 a first in <i>literae humaniores</i>, which, so out of sympathy was he with the prevailing tone of Oxford philosophy, he owed entirely to his marks in ancient history.<br>
<br>On the advice of his tutor, Gilbert Ryle, who had already introduced him to the ideas of Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein&#151;and to the latter personally&#151;Ayer spent the winter of 1932&#150;3 in Vienna, attending Moritz Schlick's lectures and the meetings of the Vienna circle, and then returned to a lectureship at Christ Church, to which he had been elected while still an undergraduate, and which he held until 1939.<br>
<br>In 1936 Ayer published his most famous book, <span class="italic">Language, Truth and Logic</span>, written at the age at which (as he liked to recall) David Hume had written his <span class="italic">Treatise of Human Nature</span> (1739). It was his version of Viennese logical positivism, though he also saw it as a recasting of the traditional theses of British empiricism into linguistic terms. The book is full of passionate iconoclasm, expressed in a fine cadenced prose. Its central thesis is the verification principle, which divided all statements into the verifiable or the unverifiable. Verifiable statements were either, like everyday beliefs or science, reducible to observation statements, or, like mathematics or logic, transformable by means of definitions into tautologies, and only they were meaningful. Unverifiable statements (metaphysics, ethics, religion) were literally nonsense. Difficulties found in formulating the principle were treated as comparatively insubstantial, though, when the book was reissued in 1946, the new thirty-six-page introduction, itself a model of philosophical frankness, gave them much greater weight.<br>
<br>Ayer's ideas scandalized established philosophy (notably H. W. B. Joseph, H. A. Prichard, and Harold Joachim), not least through their self-assurance, and they infiltrated pre-war Oxford mainly through a discussion group of younger dons who met in Isaiah Berlin's rooms in All Souls College. The young J. L. Austin was an early convert, but only briefly, and was then, for more than twenty-five years, Ayer's relentless critic. The more open-minded of the older philosophers, such as William Kneale and H. H. Price, regarded Ayer's impact on Oxford philosophy as salutary.<br>
<br>Ayer's next book, <span class="italic">The Foundations of Empirical Knowledge</span> (1940), philosophically his most refined work, supplemented the earlier attempt to set the limits of human knowledge with an account, based on sense-data, of how we attain this knowledge. By the time of its publication Ayer was in the army. He was commissioned in the Welsh Guards, but mostly served in the Special Operations Executive. He ended the war as a captain, attached to the British embassy in Paris.<br>
<br>In 1945 Ayer went to Wadham College, Oxford, as philosophy tutor, a post to which he had been elected in 1944, but in 1946 he obtained the Grote chair of the philosophy of mind and logic at University College, London. Here Ayer's charismatic powers as a teacher, enhanced by his swiftness in discussion, and his broad and growing fame as the author of <span class="italic">Language, Truth and Logic</span>, came into their own, and he converted a run-down department into the rival of Oxford and Cambridge. This was the happiest period of his career. In 1956 he published <span class="italic">The Problem of Knowledge</span>, in which, abandoning reductionism, he justified our everyday beliefs by their power to explain our sense-experience. This line of argument was developed in such later works as <span class="italic">The Origins of Pragmatism</span> (1968) and <span class="italic">Russell and Moore</span> (1971), in which the history of philosophy was deftly blended with philosophical argument, and <span class="italic">The Central Questions of Philosophy</span> (1973), which aimed at updating Russell's <span class="italic">The Problems of Philosophy</span> (1912).<br>
<br>In 1959 Ayer had accepted the Wykeham chair of logic at Oxford, which was held at New College, partly to continue his polemic with Austin, who died the following year. Ayer always held that philosophy, to be worthwhile, must aim at generality: Austin saw no reason to believe this. In <span class="italic">Sense and Sensibilia</span>, a very influential work in the late 1940s and 1950s, Austin had tried to show how Ayer's phenomenalism had grown out of a refusal to pay attention to the detail of the way in which we report our perceptual experience.<br>
<br>Though perhaps no longer at the epicentre of debate, Ayer fought with immense skill and undiminished speed and agility against such developments as ordinary-language philosophy, Wittgensteinianism, and the new essentialism. He liked philosophy to be high-spirited as well as serious. He remained a great and generous teacher, and a prolific writer, with twenty-six books to his name before his death (including two volumes of rather unrevelatory autobiography) and one after. He shone at international conferences. He retired in 1978 and was a fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford, from 1978 to 1983.<br>
<br>Like his friend and hero, Bertrand Russell, Ayer did not treat philosophy as a cloistered enterprise. In the post-war years he reached a wide audience through the BBC's <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/57624', "The Brains Trust")</script>, and later was active against anti-homosexual legislation. Immediately after the war he helped to familiarize British readers with the leading ideas of such French philosophers as Jean-Paul Sartre, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Albert Camus. But it was their role in the world of letters, of which there was no equivalent in Britain, that appealed to him, and in due course what he saw as their indifference to clarity exasperated him.<br>
<br>Freddie, as Ayer was known, was highly gregarious, elegant, and an animated conversationalist. He was short, with large, dark brown eyes, and a sudden smile which irradiated his fine, somewhat pensive features. He spoke very fast, and to the accompaniment of quick, fluent gestures. His friends included writers, painters, politicians, and journalists. He hated religion, and followed competitive sport, particularly football, avidly. He loved the company of women, and was much loved in turn. Vanity was in his nature, but he combined this with great charm and total loyalty to his friends.<br>
<br>Ayer was made FBA in 1952, and a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963: he was knighted in 1970, and became a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1977. He received honorary degrees from Brussels (1962), East Anglia (1972), London (1978), Trent, Canada (1980), Bard, USA (1983), and Durham (1986). He became an honorary fellow of New College, Oxford (1980).<br>
<br>Ayer was married four times: first, in 1932 to (Grace Isabel) Ren&eacute;e (1909&#150;1980), daughter of Colonel Thomas Orde Lees, explorer, of the Royal Marines (she subsequently married Ayer's friend and colleague the philosopher Stuart Hampshire). The marriage was dissolved in 1941 and on 18 July 1960 he married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/92278/', "Alberta Constance (Dee) Wells (1925&#150;2003)")</script>, former wife of Alfred Wells, American diplomat, and daughter of John Chapman, business executive, from the local newspaper-owning family in Providence, Rhode Island: they had one son. The marriage was dissolved in 1983 and in the same year he married Vanessa Mary Addison, former wife of Nigel Lawson MP and daughter of Felix Salmon, businessman. She died in 1985 and on 26 April 1989 he married again Dee Wells, who survived him. Ayer also had a daughter with Sheilah Graham, the Hollywood columnist (see W. W. Fairey, <span class="italic">One of the Family</span>, 1993). When Ayer died in University College Hospital, London, on 27 June 1989, the event received much publicity in the press, serious and popular, and it was seen as bringing to an end a long line of outspoken arbiters of liberal or secular opinion.<br>
