<span class="headword">Townson,  Thomas</span>  (1715&#150;1792), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious writer</span>, was born at Much Lees, Essex, where he was baptized on 17 April 1715. He was the eldest son of John Townson (<i>d</i>. 1734), rector of Much Lees, and his wife, Lucretia (1683&#150;1760), daughter of Edward Wiltshire, rector of Kirk Andrews upon Esk. He was educated first by Henry Nott, vicar of Terling in Essex, and then at Felsted School. He matriculated as a commoner at Christ Church, Oxford, on 13 March 1733. He was elected a demy of Magdalen College, Oxford, in July 1735, and a probationary fellow in 1737. During his time at Magdalen he wrote several hexameters. He graduated BA on 20 October 1736 and MA on 20 June 1739. He was ordained deacon on 20 December 1741 and priest on 19 September 1742; three days later he embarked on a tour of France, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands in the company of William Francis Drake and Edward Holdsworth, and on his return in 1745 resumed tutorial work in Oxford. On 25 August 1746 he was instituted to the vicarage of Hatfield Peverel in Essex. He was junior dean of arts in 1748 and 1749, and in the latter year resigned the living of Hatfield. On 6 June 1749 he became senior proctor of the university, and on 29 August he was presented to the rectory of Blithfield in Staffordshire. On 15 June 1750, soon after the end of his term as proctor, he graduated BD, and served as bursar of Magdalen.<br>
<br>Townson was said to be second only to Robert Lowth in scholarship at Oxford. Though he was reluctant to leave the university he did so on 9 December 1751, preparatory to his institution to the lower mediety of Malpas, Cheshire. He took up residence there on 2 January 1752, resigning his fellowship at about the same time, and lived there until his death. He turned down an exchange of livings in Whitechapel in 1756, and after spending some years dividing his time between his two parishes, he resigned Blithfield in February 1759, on receiving a bequest of &pound;8000 from an old friend, William Barcroft, rector of Fairstead and vicar of Kelvedon, Essex. Townson then applied himself more especially to literary pursuits, publishing, in 1767, two works on Francis Blackburne's <span class="italic">The Confessional</span>. In September 1768 he virtually repeated his European tour of 1742, returning in October 1769 to a joyful welcome from his parishioners.<br>
<br>Townson subsequently published numerous articles in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. In 1778 his <span class="italic">Discourses on the Four Gospels</span> appeared, which Lowth called a &#145;capital performance&#146; and which was translated into German  (Allibone, <span class="italic">Dict.</span>, 3.2442). On 30 October 1781 he was collated to the archdeaconry of Richmond in Yorkshire, a position to which was attached a prebendal stall in Chester. In 1783 he was offered the regius professorship of divinity at Oxford, which he declined on account of his age, yet, at seventy-five, he was still capable of writing Latin poetry for his friend William Drake. In 1790, however, he began to suffer a painful disease of the lungs, which eventually killed him. He died, unmarried, at Malpas on 15 April 1792, with his friend and biographer archdeacon Ralph Churton present, and was buried near the north wall of the churchyard on 23 April. His younger brother John Townson, of Gray's Inn, erected a tablet to his memory in the chancel.<br>
<br>In 1793 Townson's <span class="italic">Discourse on Evangelical History</span> appeared, edited by the Revd Thomas Bagshaw; Ralph Churton published a memoir of Townson, together with his <span class="italic">Works</span>, in 1810. Bishop John Jebb edited Townson's <span class="italic">Practical Discourses</span> (1830), which he says &#145;were admired and valued by the brightest ornaments of the last age&#146;  (Allibone, <span class="italic">Dict.</span>, 3.2442).<br>
