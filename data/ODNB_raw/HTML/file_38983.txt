<span class="headword">Cash,  John</span>  (1822&#150;1880), <span class="occ">ribbon manufacturer</span>, was born on 16 February 1822 at Sherbourne House, Coventry, the eldest son of Joseph Cash, a Quaker stuff merchant and leading businessman. John's younger brother <a name="cosubject_38983"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Cash</span>  (1826&#150;1880), <span class="occ">ribbon manufacturer</span>, was born on 28 October 1826 at the same address. After serving seven-year apprenticeships with stuff merchants and so becoming entitled to become freemen of the city, the brothers operated a silk ribbon-making business from a warehouse in Hertford Street, Coventry, in the early 1840s.<br>
<br>In 1846 John and Joseph Cash built a factory at West Orchard, Coventry, equipping it mainly with steam-powered Jacquard looms and taking on French designers to create their ribbons. In 1852 John Cash married Mary Sibree, the daughter of an Independent minister. Joseph married Sarah Iliffe in 1851, and, like his brother, raised a large family. By 1856, they employed 200 weavers in the factory, and expressed their Quaker ideals by operating a sickness benefit club and organizing outings for their employees' holidays. The brothers paid some of the highest wages in the local ribbon trade until 1857, when they were obliged to adopt the lower wage standard imposed by Coventry masters.<br>
<br>Following wage disputes among the outworkers, however, and under the guidance of their philosopher friend Charles Bray, as well as being prompted by their Quaker principles, the Cash brothers drew up plans to build a factory which combined the old outwork method of weaving with modern factory organization. They bought a 7 acre field a mile from the city centre and planned to build 100 &#145;top shops&#146;, or cottage factories, arranged round a square. Capital for their project came mainly from relatives and fellow Quaker businessmen. In the event, only forty-eight houses were built at Kingfield, starting in 1857. Even so, the Cashes set up a dramatic society, sports clubs, and evening classes for their workers.<br>
<br>In 1860 the Anglo-French trade treaty brought an influx of high-quality, low-priced ribbons, and many Coventry firms collapsed, unable to compete. J. and J. Cash, as it now was, suffered severe losses, and the brothers were obliged radically to restructure their partnership. They reorganized the top shops on factory lines and set up a departmental structure to embark on diversification. Their first new line was narrow frillings, for which they took out a patent in September 1860. Thanks to the Cash brothers' prudent management, as well as the guarantee of capital from relatively safe sources, the business survived, with diversification into other fabric lines an important factor in its continuing viability.<br>
<br>The brothers preserved their reputation as benevolent employers, and during a strike in 1860 refused to lock out their employees. By 1862, however, the general collapse of trade appears to have made them somewhat more exacting and harsher.<br>
<br>John and Joseph Cash were known throughout Coventry for their philanthropy, and Joseph founded St Thomas's infant school. Both brothers made handsome contributions to local charities. Additionally, John served as a Liberal on Coventry city council, 1868&#150;76. John Cash became increasingly drawn to the Independent nonconformists, and established an Independent chapel in Vicar Lane. His work for the Independents caused him to be disowned by the Quakers in 1844.<br>
<br>John Cash was in poor health for the last two years of his life, but kept up his daily routine and his regular visits to business acquaintances. On one occasion he injured his leg at Cheltenham railway station, but was determined to fulfil his day's engagement. On returning home, he had to have the boot cut off the swollen limb, which was found to be broken.<br>
<br>John Cash was reserved in character, but inclined to be abrupt in manner in business discussions, as a result of which he was sometimes misunderstood. Although keen to support local causes dear to his heart, such as education, he was never one to court popularity. In private life, among family and friends, he was generally frank and genial, and eager to hear the views of others as well as (sometimes forcibly) express his own.<br>
<br>Both brothers died in 1880, John on 9 September at Rosehill, his Coventry residence, leaving a personal estate of less than &pound;60,000, and Joseph on 14 October at his home, Bird Grove, Coventry, leaving an estate of under &pound;45,000. John was buried at Coventry cemetery on 14 September; the chief mourners included his five sons and three nephews. The partnership was taken over by John's eldest son, Sidney (1856&#150;1931), and his cousin Joseph (1853&#150;1927). The well-known Cash's name-tapes were introduced only in the early twentieth century, originally as labels for manufacturers who wished to identify their products.<br>
