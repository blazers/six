<span class="headword">Davenport,  Robert</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1624&#150;1640), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, is one of the most obscure dramatists of the Caroline era. In 1639 he dedicated a poem to two actors, and so he may have been the Robert Davenport, gentleman of St Botolph, London, who was arrested in 1612 along with William Stratford of Prince Henry's men for wounding Henry Saunders at Hoxton.<br>
<br>The first certain record of Davenport comes on 10 April 1624, when <span class="italic">The Historye of Henry the First, Written by Damport</span> was licensed for the King's Men by the master of the revels. This play is lost but it was entered in the Stationers' register in 1653 along with another lost play, <span class="italic">Henry the 2nd</span>, as a work of &#145;Shakespeare, &amp; Davenport&#146; and it also appears in William Warburton's eighteenth-century list of play manuscripts burnt by his cook. The attribution to Shakespeare has been generally dismissed by scholars. On 14 October 1624 another play of Davenport's, <span class="italic">The City Night-Cap</span>, was licensed for Lady Elizabeth's men at the Cockpit, and this work was eventually printed in 1661. This moral comedy contains contrasting plots of a virtuous wife and a jealous husband (taken from Robert Greene's <span class="italic">Philomela</span>), and a faithless but witty wife and a foolish husband (taken from Boccaccio's <span class="italic">Decameron</span>).<br>
<br>Davenport's next known play, <span class="italic">King John and Matilda</span>, is a reworking of Chettle and Munday's <span class="italic">Death of Robert Earl of Huntington</span> (1598); although it was first mentioned in 1639 and not printed until 1655 it can be dated 1628&#150;34 from the cast list provided in the quarto. In 1630 &#145;A Comedy called The Pedler by R: Davenport&#146; was entered in the Stationers' register, which may be either a lost play or a misattribution of Thomas Randolph's <span class="italic">Conceited Pedlar</span>. About 1634 Davenport wrote a manuscript, &#145;Dialogue between Policy and Piety&#146;, dedicated to John Bramhall, bishop of Derry, and containing veiled commentary on Irish affairs. Since Davenport signed the dedication &#145;a servant and poore neighboure&#146;  (Folger Shakespeare Library, Washington, Folger MS V.a.313) he may have been living in Ireland at the time. Another manuscript of the &#145;Dialogue&#146;, dedicated to Sir John Kaye, was noted by Hunter in <span class="italic">Chorus vatum Anglicanorum</span> as belonging to John Wittern of Broomhead. Davenport's manuscript poem &#145;A Survey of the Sciences&#146; (now at Cambridge) was probably written about the same time; it is dedicated in similar terms to Dr John Oldesworth, contains a nearly identical exhortation &#145;To the Booke&#146;, and has the same closing line. A third manuscript by Davenport, datable to 1629&#150;43 and dedicated to William Cavendish, earl of Newcastle, contains a prose character and four poems expressing conventional moral sentiments.<br>
<br>In 1639 Davenport published a volume containing two religious poems in dialogue form, <span class="italic">A Crowne for a Conqueror and Too Late to Call Back Yesterday</span>. It was dedicated to two actors of the King's Men, Richard Robinson and Michael Bowyer, and in the dedication Davenport calls the poems &#145;some expence of my time at Sea&#146;  (Bullen, 311). The same year saw the publication of a moral comedy attributed to Davenport, <span class="italic">A New Trick to Cheat the Devil</span>, in which the Devil appears dressed as a gentleman. However, Lake has cast doubt on Davenport's authorship on stylistic grounds; furthermore, the address from the publisher calls the play &#145;an Orphant, and wanting the Father which first begot it&#146;  (Bentley, 235), even though the following year Davenport prefixed commendatory verses to Nathaniel Richards's <span class="italic">Tragedy of Messalina</span> and to Thomas Rawlins's <span class="italic">The Rebellion</span>.<br>
<br>In 1651 Samuel Shepard addressed an epigram &#145;To Mr. Davenport on his Play called the Pirate&#146;  (Monie, vii) and the address to the reader in the 1655 quarto of <span class="italic">King John and Matilda</span> is signed R. D., both further suggesting that Davenport was still alive. In 1653 <span class="italic">The Woman's Mistake</span> (now lost) was attributed to Davenport and Drew in the Stationers' register, and in 1660 <span class="italic">The Fatal Brothers</span> and <span class="italic">The Politic Queen</span> (also lost) were attributed to Davenport alone. Several extant anonymous plays have been attributed to him on dubious grounds.<br>
