<span class="headword">Maxwell,  James, of Kirkconnel</span>  (1708&#150;1762), <span class="occ">Jacobite army officer and writer</span>, was the son of William Maxwell of Kirkconnel (<i>c</i>.1675&#150;1746) and Janet (<i>c</i>.1675&#150;1755), eldest daughter and heir of George Maxwell of Carnsalloch, and widow of Colonel John Douglas of Stenhouse. His family is one of the oldest in Scotland, the site of Kirkconnel House having been occupied since the days of Malcolm III Cean M&oacute;r (<i>r</i>. 1057&#150;93), and the Maxwells there figuring prominently in the history of Scotland since the thirteenth century. At the Reformation the Maxwells remained Catholic, and James, like many of his family, was educated at Douai (1721&#150;8). In 1758 he married Mary, daughter of Thomas Riddell of Swinburne Castle, and they had three sons, James (later of Kirkconnel), William&#151;a republican who commanded &#145;the guard escorting Louis XVI to the guillotine&#146;  (Lenman, 89), and Thomas.<br>
<br>Maxwell, acting with the support of his father, joined Prince Charles (Charles Edward Stuart) at Edinburgh on 18 October 1745, and was commissioned in Lord Elcho's Lifeguard squadron, then newly formed. His exact rank and position in the Jacobite forces remains in doubt: various sources describe him as lieutenant, captain, major, and even lieutenant-colonel. Whatever his military position (captain subsequently promoted major is most likely, probably combined with some unrecorded aide-de-camp role on the general staff), he appears to have had privileged access to the innermost counsels of the Jacobite leadership, being &#145;in the council, though not a member of it&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). As a result, he was able to leave, in his <span class="italic">Narrative of Charles Prince of Wales' Expedition to Scotland</span>, one of the most useful primary sources on the Jacobite rising of 1745. In hiding after the battle of Culloden, he subsequently escaped to France, where he resided at St Germain: it was here that he composed his <span class="italic">Narrative</span> between 1746 and 1750. Its literary style and quality are noteworthy. He succeeded his father as laird of Kirkconnel in 1746, and was able to return to Scotland in 1750; subsequently he built the modern portion of Kirkconnel House in brick. After his mother's death in 1755, he sold the estate of Carnsalloch, which he had inherited from her, to Alexander Johnstone, a London merchant. He died on 23 July 1762, survived by his wife.<br>
