<span class="headword">Kem,  Joseph <span class="st"> [Teddy]</span></span>  (<em>bap. </em>1700, <em>d.</em> 1780), <span class="occ">miser and farmer-weaver</span>, was baptized on 14 May 1700 at Wolvey, Warwickshire, the younger son of Joseph Kem (<i>c</i>.1680&#150;<i>c</i>.1730), butcher, and his wife, Frances (<i>c</i>.1680&#150;1731). He was the great-great-grandson of Samuel Keme, the puritan divine and spy. Joseph's elder brother, Daniel, became a yeoman farmer at Smockington, Leicestershire, a few miles distant from Wolvey. Joseph remained in the Wolvey&#150;Monks Kirby area of Warwickshire until he married Mary Butler on 10 April 1722 at St Mary de Castro Church in Leicester. Within a year mother and child had died during childbirth, and were interred at the parish church of St Margaret, Leicester.<br>
<br>Kem's early career was that of both a &#145;customer-weaver&#146;, with independent status in the village and making up customers' orders, and a &#145;smallholder weaver&#146;, working part-time at the loom. In his later life the erratic nature of the local weaving industry may have given him the status of a superior artisan, self-employed and working by the &#145;piece&#146; for a choice of masters. By 1763 Kem was proprietor and farmer at Sinney Fields (valued at &pound;3 17<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>.), Burton Hastings, near Attleborough. He had probably moved by 1767 and was then associated with Daniel Leigh (who managed Lord Pagett's Attleborough lands).<br>
<br>In 1772 and 1773 Kem was brought before the local court for failing to clean ditches and cut hedges, which was part of his tenancy agreement. This was a serious offence because the local rivers rose seasonally and the ditches were essential to flood relief. The punishments varied from public humiliation to fining. Kem was threatened twice with fines of &pound;1 10<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>., a sum which no tenant farmer could have paid unless he earned extra income. The fine was not paid but Kem relented and thereafter undertook his specified duties. It was believed that he made a great deal of money, but that he hid the coins in the walls or chimney of his house while continuing to maintain a frugal lifestyle.<br>
<br>In 1774 Kem voted in the Warwickshire elections, giving his place of abode as Nuneaton. His voting status implied he was a &#145;forty-shilling freeholder&#146;, or yeoman, farming his own land and enjoying parliamentary franchise. He voted for Skipwith the whig and Mordaunt the tory. He died in February 1780 and on Tuesday 29 February was buried at St Nicolas parish church, Nuneaton, in an unmarked grave, leaving no will or descendants.<br>
<br>Kem's life history became well known in the nineteenth century and historians made references to this miserly character. Such austere behaviour was influenced by the <span class="italic">Whole Duty of Man</span> (1658). By 1861 George Eliot had developed the story into <span class="italic">Silas Marner</span>, with the help of her father, Robert Evans. Alfred Scrivener, a local historian and journalist, drew on literary and historical sources for his article in the <span class="italic">Nuneaton Observer</span>, on 27 December 1878. The story was reprinted in 1909 emphasizing the gold hoarding of the hermit. The local public reaction was unexpected; many people then scoured the site, looking for gold coins. Kem's farm was cited on Ordnance Survey maps from 1887 to 1966 as Teddy Kem's Heaven. The name Teddy was a local corruption of &#145;tedder&#146;, a person who cut grass and laid it out to dry. The farm was demolished about 1970, and the site was later developed for housing. In 2002 the local authority agreed to place a commemorative tablet there, marking the site.<br>
