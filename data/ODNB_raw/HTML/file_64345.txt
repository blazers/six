<span class="headword">Hallam,  Lewis</span>  (1714?&#150;1756?), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was the son of the actor, singer, and dancer Thomas Hallam (<i>d</i>. 1735) and his wife, whose name is unknown. Thomas, who was killed by the hot-tempered Charles Macklin when he dared to try on Macklin's wig in Macklin's dressing room at the Drury Lane Theatre, acted at the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin from at least 1707 until 1724; it may be that his son Lewis was born in Dublin. One of Lewis's brothers was an admiral; the other three brothers and a sister were performers. <a name="cosubject_64343"></a><span class="headword">William Hallam</span>  (1712?&#150;1758?), Lewis's elder and most theatrically significant brother, was a <span class="occ">strolling player</span> in the British provinces and acted in Dublin. He also ran a booth at Bartholomew fair in London, and acted at Covent Garden, the Haymarket, and Lincoln's Inn Fields theatres before opening in 1740 his own playhouse, the New Wells (a &#145;drinking theatre&#146;, at which singing, tumbling, rope-dancing, and pantomimes were performed) in Lemon Street in Goodman's Fields. William Hallam, although apparently a mediocre performer, enjoyed a modest success by offering variety entertainments so that he and his company would not violate the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span> of 1737, which restricted &#145;legitimate&#146; drama in London to the two patent houses, Drury Lane and Covent Garden. Although he did begin to present &#145;legitimate&#146; plays in 1744, he remained technically within the law by advertising his entertainment as a &#145;concert&#146; in two parts, the first part to be followed by a play, offered, according to the advertisement, at no charge to the audience.<h2>
<a name="TheprospectofAmerica"></a>The prospect of America</h2>Lewis Hallam, who gained experience with his family acting in the British provinces, later performed at London's fairs (and perhaps at the minor theatres, including the Haymarket) before working with William's company at the New Wells from 1745 until 1748, and again in 1750. Lewis was possibly a somewhat more accomplished performer than William, but he was clearly unable to achieve success on the London stage.<br>
<br>The Hallam brothers apparently saw that their best chance for theatrical success was to lead a troupe to America, where few professional actors had ventured. They had almost surely heard of&#151;and were perhaps inspired by&#151;the success of John Moody, an Irish actor who had recruited English performers to form a spectacularly successful repertory company in the West Indies. In October 1750 the Hallams dispatched Robert Upton, an actor, to the colonies as an advance scout for the London company. Meanwhile, William's ruse to circumvent the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span> eventually stimulated a grievance, and in 1751, after complaints had been filed, the lord chamberlain closed the Wells in Lemon Street, causing William to seek another method of securing his livelihood in the theatre.<br>
<br>William and Lewis patiently awaited word from Upton. The brothers agreed that Lewis would accompany the troupe to America and William would remain in London. The profits from their colonial company, to be known as the London Company of Comedians, would be divided equally between them. Months passed, however, with no word from Upton. As Lewis later complained, &#145;On his arrival Upton found &hellip; that sett of pretenders with whom he joined and, unhappily for us, quite neglected the business he was sent about from England. For we never heard of him after&#146;  (Hornblow, 1.67). The group in question was a short-lived, evidently barely competent acting company, &#145;composed of stage-struck tradesmen and their wives&#146;  (Rankin, 42), headed by Walter Murray and Thomas Kean; Upton later formed his own troupe, which, like the Murray&#150;Kean company, did not last long. The performances of both companies were probably on the most amateurish level. Indeed, until the arrival of the London Company of Comedians, theatrical presentations in America were almost certainly inept, as attested by the failure of the early companies to find audiences loyal and numerous enough to ensure their theatrical survival.<br>
<br>After waiting to hear from Upton for more than a year, the Hallams determined to delay no longer. The troupe, consisting of William and Lewis Hallam (who was to play comic roles and serious old men), the latter's wife, <a name="cosubject_64345"></a><span class="headword">Sarah Hallam</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Mrs Lewis Hallam]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1774)<span class="occ"></span>&#151;her maiden name is unknown but her first name is given in the baptismal record of her daughter Isabella&#151;who was to play female leads, William Rigby, who was assigned the male leads, and nine other adults, plus three of Hallam's four children, sailed for the colonies in early May 1752, on the <i>Charming Sally</i>. Hallam's daughter Isabella remained behind to live with her aunt; she later became famous as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18350/', "Isabella Mattocks (1746&#150;1826)")</script>, a leading performer at Covent Garden. Aboard ship, the actors rehearsed on the quarterdeck when the weather permitted.<h2>
<a name="Thecolonialstage"></a>The colonial stage</h2>The Hallams' company arrived in Yorktown, Virginia, on 2 June and travelled by land to Williamsburg. On 12 June Lewis Hallam placed an advertisement in the <span class="italic">Virginia Gazette</span>, announcing that his:<blockquote>select company of Comedians, [with] Scenes, Cloaths and Decorations &hellip; all entirely new, extremely rich, and finished in the highest Taste, the Scenes being painted by the best Hands in London &hellip; the company being perfected in all the best Plays, Opera's, Farces, and Pantomimes</blockquote>was ready to perform. The colonial governor initially disapproved Hallam's application to present plays, for the now disbanded Murray&#150;Kean troupe's rowdy behaviour in Williamsburg had inflamed opposition to all theatrical endeavours. Hallam persisted, however, running his advertisement on two more occasions. One of the troupe's actors advertised that he would offer violin lessons to the inhabitants of Williamsburg and surrounding towns, perhaps helping to persuade the governor of the good character of the Hallam company. At any rate, the governor eventually agreed to grant Hallam a licence. Hallam purchased a building in Williamsburg that Murray and Kean had used to present their plays and refurbished it. The theatre opened on 15 September 1752 with Lord Lansdowne's <span class="italic">The Jew of Venice</span>, which Hallam billed as <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, &#145;Written by Shakespear&#146;, adding that this was &#145;the first play performed in America by a regular company of [British] comedians&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). Mrs Hallam appeared as Portia, Patrick Malone played Shylock, Rigby was featured as Bassanio, while Lewis Hallam performed the comparatively small role of Launcelot. Playing a servant to Portia was twelve-year-old <a name="cosubject_64344"></a><span class="headword">Lewis Hallam the younger</span>  (1740&#150;1808)<span class="occ"></span>, who eventually became one of the leading performers in America, but on this occasion, never having acted before, burst into tears and ran off the stage. Still, the production, given by experienced professional actors&#151;albeit actors who had found only modest success in the competitive theatrical environment of London&#151;was undoubtedly the finest yet seen in America, and it inaugurated an eleven-month stay in Williamsburg, during which the company played three nights a week to large houses. Although several of the actors wound up in debtors' prison and had to be bailed out by Hallam, the first engagement of the London Company could reasonably be described as successful. From Williamsburg Hallam led the company to New York, where they opened on 17 September 1753.<br>
<br>The Hallam brothers' agreement to split whatever profits their company might bring held until 1754, when William, evidently in dire financial straits, sold his interest in the company to Lewis and returned to London. He played at Bartholomew fair and received a benefit at Sadler's Wells in 1756 before he died, presumably in 1758.<br>
<br>From 1753 to 1755 the London Company of Comedians, led by Lewis Hallam, played in New York, where it once again had to overcome opposition based on the misbehaviour of the Murray&#150;Kean troupe; in Philadelphia, where religious opposition to the theatre was particularly strong; and in Charles Town, South Carolina. Hallam built new theatres in New York and Charles Town and remodelled a warehouse into &#145;the New Theatre in Water-Street&#146; in Philadelphia. In February 1755 the Hallams repaired to Jamaica, perhaps hoping to duplicate John Moody's success. Moody had earlier sailed to England to join David Garrick's company at Drury Lane, but the core of his organization was still intact, now led by <a name="cosubject_64346"></a><span class="headword">David Douglass</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1789), an <span class="occ">actor</span> originally recruited from England by Moody. Douglass, who was preparing to return to England to enlist new actors, realized that the arrival of Hallam's troupe made his trip unnecessary. Instead, he and Hallam joined forces.<h2>
<a name="DouglassandtheyoungerHallam"></a>Douglass and the younger Hallam</h2>Lewis Hallam died of yellow fever shortly after this time (the exact date is unknown), but the combined company remained united under Douglass's leadership. Still, the credit for having established the first fully professional theatre in colonial America belongs to Lewis Hallam the elder and to his brother William.<br>
<br>In 1758 Douglass married Lewis Hallam's widow and led the troupe back to the colonies. Lewis Hallam the younger, then eighteen, became the company's leading actor, often appearing opposite his mother, on several occasions playing Romeo to her Juliet. William Dunlap, the first historian of the American theatre, described the mature Hallam as &#145;of middle stature or above&#146; (another account says he was 5 feet 7 inches), &#145;thin, straight, and well taught as a dancer and fencer&#146;  (Dunlap, 1.155). In later years he vied with several others for the title of America's foremost actor. Rivals included John Palmer, who began performing with the London Company in 1759 and later became a leading actor in London. Another was John Henry, like Palmer an actor from England, who joined the company in 1767, and was generally recognized as more gifted than Hallam; he soon began to play many of the leading roles for the American Company, beginning a feud with the younger Hallam that was to last for nearly thirty years.<br>
<br>However, Hallam had his loyal adherents. Alexander Graydon, who expressed early scepticism about Hallam's abilities, later said:<blockquote>He was &hellip; at Philadelphia, as much the soul of the Southwark Theatre, as ever Garrick was of Drury lane; and if, as Doctor Johnson allows, popularity in matters of taste is unquestionable evidence of merit, we cannot withhold a considerable portion of it from Mr. Hallam, notwithstanding his faults. (Graydon, 87&#150;8)</blockquote>Douglass and his company invariably faced hostility&#151;economic, religious, political, or moral&#151;to the theatre wherever they played in colonial America, but they shrewdly wore down the opposition by behaving irreproachably offstage, offering performances for charity, and deleting any potentially offensive scenes or lines from the plays they performed. Furthermore, Douglass continued the tradition established by Lewis Hallam the elder of building theatres (or converting existing buildings into playhouses) at many stops, for colonial America lacked theatre structures. Douglass's company offered the first professional production of an American play, Thomas Godfrey's <span class="italic">The Prince of Parthia</span>, in 1767, and produced Shakespeare's plays (albeit generally in their eighteenth-century versions) and new British plays (Goldsmith's <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span> was given in 1773, the same year it had its first performance in London).<br>
<br>Despite the rigours of offering performances where, in many cases, plays had never been seen before, the company appeared in cities and small towns in New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, South Carolina, Maryland, and elsewhere, winning influential adherents such as George Washington. Despite periodic defections from the company, Douglass persisted, succeeding more often than not. The company's once-tenuous reputation had improved so greatly by 1761 that the governor and council of Virginia gave Douglass the following letter of reference:<blockquote>The company of comedians under the direction of David Douglass has performed in this colony for near twelve-month; during which time they have made it their constant practice to behave with prudence and discretion in their private character, and to use their utmost endeavours to give general satisfaction in their public capacity. We have therefore thought proper to recommend them as a company whose behaviour merits the favour of the public and who are capable of entertaining a sensible and polite audience. (<span class="italic">Newport Mercury</span>, 11 Aug 1761)</blockquote>Perhaps Douglass's shrewdest stroke was to rename his troupe the American Company of Comedians in 1763, thereby attracting American audiences by aligning his company with the colonists in their struggle against Great Britain. While for the most part the company's personnel continued to come from England (Douglass made periodic trips there to recruit new actors and seek out new plays), a few American-born performers also joined the troupe.<br>
<br>Mrs Douglass (the former Mrs Hallam) died in Philadelphia in 1774 of &#145;a hurt received in the theatre&#146;, according to a contemporary report  (Rankin, 187). Later that year the Continental Congress passed a resolution condemning all theatrical performances and other &#145;diversions&#146; until the conflict against the British was resolved. The American Company, preparing to begin a new season, recognized that attempting to defy the congress's direct order would be futile; it immediately closed its theatres and set sail for the British West Indies, where it remained for the next ten years, but under new leadership. Douglass soon retired from the stage, founded the <span class="italic">Jamaica Mercury and Kingston Advertiser</span> (later called the <span class="italic">New Royal Gazette</span>), and amassed a considerable fortune. He died in 1789.<br>
<br>Lewis Hallam the younger returned to England in 1775 and gave one performance (and endured a merciless review in the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>) as Hamlet at Covent Garden. By 1779 he was again in Jamaica, where he acted under the direction of John Henry, who had taken over the management of the American Company after Douglass's retirement. In 1785 Henry took his troupe to Maryland, then New York. Meanwhile, Hallam, in conjunction with a Mr Allen, had assembled &#145;a feeble company&#146;  (Seilhamer, 2.165) that played in Philadelphia and New York.<h2>
<a name="TheOldAmericanCompany"></a>The Old American Company</h2>In New York in 1785, Henry recommended to Hallam that their companies join forces, to which Hallam agreed. Their troupe, now known as the Old American Company, dominated the American theatre until 1792, when one of their actors, Thomas Wignell, formed his own company in Philadelphia.<br>
<br>During the years of its dominance, the Old American Company performed principally in New York and Philadelphia. According to the nineteenth-century historian George O. Seilhamer, the company under the joint leadership of Hallam and Henry:<blockquote>was superior to any that had as yet been seen in America. &hellip; The pieces produced [by the company] would have been creditable to any of the London theatres. New productions followed each other in rapid succession, and for the first time in the history of the American stage successful plays had what might be called a run. This was notably the case with the &#145;School for Scandal&#146; and &#145;The Poor Soldier,&#146; the former being played seven and the latter eighteen times during the season. &hellip; The long exile of ten years in [Jamaica] had kept the organization together, strengthened it by the addition of new members, and enabled it to keep pace with dramatic progress in England. (Seilhamer, 2.177&#150;9)</blockquote>The Old American Company was plagued with managerial disputes, no doubt because Henry and Hallam were equally duplicitous. In 1794 Henry was displaced by John Hodgkinson, who, motivated by ambition and an intense dislike for Hallam, began taking all the best roles for himself and his wife, permitting Hallam and his second wife, the former Eliza Tuke, only roles of lesser importance. Mrs Hallam cannot be said to have been blameless, however, as she not infrequently arrived at the theatre in a drunken state. On one occasion, in 1795, she was unable to complete a performance. According to William Dunlap, &#145;Mr. Hallam attributed the very strange exhibition to opium. The audience were shocked and disgusted&#146;  (Dunlap, 1.266).<br>
<br>Two years later in New York, having been deprived of all her roles by Hodgkinson and Dunlap (who had joined Hallam and Hodgkinson in the management of the Old American Company in 1796), Mrs Hallam burst onto the stage during a performance, joined by her husband. She announced that Hodgkinson had engaged in a plot to deprive her of her livelihood. Hallam supported her, and, despite Hodgkinson's appeal to the audience, a near-riot ensued. Later that year Hodgkinson published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Narrative of his Connection with the Old American Company</span>, which consisted almost entirely of his account of his grievances against the Hallams.<br>
<br>On 25 May 1797 Hallam quit as co-manager, selling his interest to Dunlap and Hodgkinson, but remained with the company as a salaried actor, as did Mrs Hallam. In 1806, however, Thomas Abthorpe Cooper, the new manager of the company, refused to renew Hallam's contract. Hallam, the last survivor in the group of actors who went to America as members of the London Company of Comedians, died in Philadelphia on 1 November 1808.<br>
<br>Hallam had two children by his first wife, Sarah, a young Jamaican girl he married when he was about eighteen (in or before 1758). Sarah Hallam, who seems to have appeared on stage only once, separated from her husband at some time around 1763. Perhaps as early as 1770, but surely by 1775, she was running a dancing-school in Williamsburg. Lewis and Sarah's son Mirvan (whose date of birth is unknown) became an actor and played in his father's company in 1793. His abilities seem to have been small, for he never became anything but a minor actor. Lewis D. Hallam, the other son of Lewis and Sarah, was a medical student when he died at the age of nineteen in 1780.<br>
