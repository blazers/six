<span class="headword">Treveris,  Peter</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1525&#150;1532), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was perhaps a foreigner, as many early London printers were, though nothing is known of his birth, early years, private life, or death. According to <span class="italic">The Grete Herball</span> printed on 27 July 1526 he lived in Southwark at the house called Wodows (wild people). He probably lived here while in London, since he always refers to Southwark whenever he includes his location in an edition. His device, a shield hanging from a tree supported by a wild man and woman, was common at this time. His first dated book is Hieronymus Braunschweig's <span class="italic">Noble Handiwork of Surgery</span>, printed on 26 March 1525 at Southwark, to which his edition of <span class="italic">The Grete Herball</span> refers: &#145;it geveth understandynge of the booke lately prentyd by me&#146;  (title-page). Two undated and unsigned volumes, <span class="italic">Arnold's Chronicle</span> and William Lily's <span class="italic">Rudimenta</span>, may have been printed by Treveris in 1525.<br>
<br>Treveris's output consisted mainly of small grammatical treatises, which had usually been printed by others before him. His most significant publications were the <span class="italic">Noble Handiwork of Surgery</span>, possibly translated by the printer and bookseller Lawrence Andrewe, <span class="italic">The Grete Herball</span>, a reprint of the <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span> in black letter &#145;at the expences of J. Reynes&#146; (1527), and John Skelton's <span class="italic">Magnyfycence</span>, printed for John Rastell (1530). He printed other works for Rastell, including <span class="italic">A C Mery Talys</span> (1526). He co-operated with other printers: some copies of <span class="italic">The Grete Herball</span> contain Andrewe's device, and book 4 of Robert Wyer's 1531 edition of Richard Whitford's translation of Thomas &agrave; Kempis's <span class="italic">De imitatione Christi</span> was apparently printed by Treveris. He copied an ornamental compartment used by Thierry Martens of Louvain for his edition of <span class="italic">Magnyfycence</span> and at least two other editions. A book with the title <span class="italic">This horryble monster is cast of a sowe in a vyllage which is called lebe[n]hayn M.CCCCC &amp; xxxi</span>, originally printed in Germany, had its original title substituted by Treveris. Two school texts without printer's name from perhaps 1526&#150;7 were said to be for sale at John Thorne's shop (&#145;ap. J. Thorne&#146;) in Oxford, though there is no evidence that Treveris ever worked there  (<span class="italic">STC, 1475&#150;1640</span>, 15574, 18833a).<br>
<br>Some of Treveris's grammatical texts were printed with or for Rastell, and others probably for Wynkyn de Worde, as Treveris's border pieces are found in them. Rastell's editions of <span class="italic">Sir Eglamour</span> (1528?) and <span class="italic">A Dialog of the Poete Lucyan</span> (1530?) may have been printed by Treveris. The other English works Treveris printed include an edition of <span class="italic">Christmas Carols</span> (1528?), the verse <span class="italic">A Merry Jest of an Old Fool with a Young Wife</span> (1530?), and <span class="italic">A Lytell Treatyse agaynst Mahumet and his Cursed Secte</span> (1530?). Treveris claimed that some of his later editions of grammatical works by John Stanbridge and Robert Whittinton had been carefully emended (for example, &#145;impressum diligenterque correctum&#146;; <span class="italic">Declinationes nominum</span>, 1531, title-page), though how far this is true has not been researched.<br>
<br>Treveris seems to have been printing until 1532. Because his material was used by Thomas Raynald from <i>c</i>.1539, Treveris probably died in the mid-1530s. Some of his books, especially the <span class="italic">Handiwork of Surgery</span> and <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span>, are notable for their woodcuts. Although the latter is neatly printed, most of his work is less attractive.<br>
