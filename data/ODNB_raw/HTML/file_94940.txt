<span class="headword">Browne,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1489), <span class="occ">merchant and benefactor</span>, was the son of John Browne (<i>d</i>. 1442), a Stamford draper and Calais stapler, and his wife, Margery (<i>d</i>. 1460). He was born into a family that can be traced in Stamford back to the mid-fourteenth century. His date of birth is uncertain, though it seems likely that he was born during the decade following 1410. It is possible that he was the William Browne who was alderman (that is mayor) of Stamford in 1435, in which case he must have been born no later than about 1415, and probably considerably earlier. But the identification cannot be regarded as established, and the earliest date at which he is certainly named is 1437, when as William Browne, draper, he took over his father's business.<br>
<br>William Browne substantially expanded the business that he had inherited, until John Leland could describe him as &#145;a marchant of a very wonderfulle richeness&#146;  (Toulmin Smith, 5.89). His wealth came from a variety of sources. First, he was engaged in the wool and cloth trades both as middleman and exporter, ranging as far afield as Coventry (where he, his brother, and his sister had interests). He was a member of the Calais staple from at least 1449, serving as its mayor in 1478, and with a number of trading partners he exported wool and cloth through Boston, Bishop's Lynn, Ipswich, and London. Second, he built up a large portfolio of properties in Stamford and in the counties of Lincolnshire, Rutland, and Northamptonshire; if his enemies are to be believed, he used ruthless methods to obtain some of them. But despite his acquisition of rural estates he never moved out of Stamford. Third, he engaged in systematic moneylending, against pledges of both property and plate, recording his dealings, in the words of his brother-in-law, &#145;in my brothers own hand in his rede boke&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/10, fols. 28<i>v</i>&#150;29<i>r</i>); when he refounded the Guild of St Katherine in Stamford in 1480 and became its alderman for life, it ran as a money-making enterprise. His loans to successive kings obtained for him grants of forfeited properties, licences to export wool free from customs, and at least five general pardons. His purchase of the Northamptonshire manor of Lilford from the seventh Baron Welles, executed for treason in 1470 and subsequently attainted, was twice specifically exempted from forfeiture to the crown. Fourth, he served in a number of potentially profitable offices, mostly in Stamford. Following his putative aldermanship of 1435, Browne was elected alderman of the town in 1444, 1449, 1460, 1466, and 1470. In two of these years his tenure coincided with political crisis; early in 1461 the town was ransacked by Queen Margaret's army, and shortly afterwards negotiations started for a new charter, granted the following year, while in 1470 Stamford was again affected by warfare, this time the revolt of the Nevilles and their allies (who included Lord Welles) against Edward IV. Browne also became alderman of the town's guilds of Corpus Christi and St Mary, and of the Holy Trinity, as well as that of St Katherine. Moreover he and his family became members of the Guild of Corpus Christi at Boston, of which he served as alderman in 1481.<br>
<br>In 1439 Browne obtained a comprehensive exemption from crown service. He was probably the William Browne appointed in 1446 to an embassy to the duke of Burgundy on behalf of the merchants of Holland, Zeeland, and Flanders, but was otherwise named to very few commissions. Instead his attention was given mostly to Stamford and its neighbourhood. He dominated the town council from at least 1465 until his death in 1489; intervening in a local dispute, he locked up the town seal. He also gave implements to the town gaol. As a justice of the peace he personally heard and recorded cases in the town, including one heard in the bishop of Lincoln's consistory court. Outside Stamford, notwithstanding his exemption, he was elector of the Lincolnshire MPs in 1450 and sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1477&#150;8, both a JP for Rutland and four times sheriff of that county, and appointed to assess the lay subsidy in Kesteven in 1442 and in Rutland in 1483. That he was acceptable to all sides in the troubled period between 1483 and 1485 is shown by his having been confirmed as sheriff of Rutland by the governments of Edward V and Richard III, after being initially appointed by that of Edward IV, and by his ability to obtain confirmations of the foundation deeds for his hospital in Stamford from both Richard III and Henry VII.<br>
<br>By the late 1430s William Browne had married Margaret Stokes (<i>d</i>. 1489) of Warmington, Northamptonshire, where his own family had owned land for many years; she was a member of a close-knit group of like-minded people, clergy and laity, that centred on the Fairfax family of Deeping Gate, Northamptonshire, and enjoyed the patronage of Margaret Beauchamp, dowager duchess of Somerset, and the latter's daughter, Lady Margaret Beaufort, who sometimes resided at Maxey nearby. She is not known to have had any political affiliation, but became active in business with her husband, as her will reveals, and herself acted as executor for a prominent Stamford mercer, Thomas Philip, a former alderman of the borough. With William she had a daughter, Elizabeth, born about 1441, who married John Elmes of Henley-on-Thames, a Calais stapler. While William Browne was generous to his daughter's family, his wealth was mainly used to finance works of charity in Stamford&#151;a new hall for the Guild of St Katherine, the extensive rebuilding of the parish church of All Saints in the Market, and the building and endowment between 1475 and 1492 of the foundation that he instructed should be called &#145;the hospital of William Browne&#146;, an almshouse that still survives, as a fitting monument to one of Stamford's most important residents.<br>
<br>William Browne never bore a coat of arms, though arms were attributed to him soon after his death. Indeed, far from claiming gentility he was careful always to style himself &#145;merchant of Staunford&#146;, or stapler of Calais, and to identify himself either by his family's trading mark or his wife's rebus, a stork. He provided himself and members of his family with memorial brasses, some of which survive in the parish church of All Saints in the Market, where he had adopted the north aisle as &#145;his proper chapel&#146;  (Butcher, 71). He maintained his own chaplain, who possessed an English version of <span class="italic">Advice for Recluses</span>  (BL, Harley MS 2372), and also supported an anchoress in St Paul's Church, Stamford. William died on 14 April 1489, leaving Browne's Hospital to be completed by his executors and trustees, who included his grandson William Elmes. Margaret died six months later, on 28 October 1489. Her brother Thomas Stokes, a canon of York and rector of Easton on the Hill, near Stamford, was her executor and oversaw the continuation of work on the hospital, work that was completed after Stokes's death in 1494 by William Elmes, who put his own arms on the hospital seal. Almost certainly through William Browne's trading interests, his sister Alice was married first to Richard Botoner, fishmonger of Coventry, and second to Robert Bradmeydew, a draper who was mayor of Coventry in 1457, with whom she had a son, John. William and <a href="#cosubject_94941">John Browne [<i>see below</i>]</a> acted as feoffees in the settlements accompanying both her marriages. After the death of her second husband Alice returned to Stamford, where she died on 10 February 1491; her memorial brass in All Saints' Church commemorates her as &#145;Alice Bradmeydew sister of William Browne of Staunford&#146;.<br>
<br>Both in the wool trade and in the government of Stamford William was assisted by his brother <a name="cosubject_94941"></a><span class="headword">John Browne</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1476)<span class="occ"></span>, with the latter always appearing in a supporting role&#151;it is doubtless significant that the two men used the same merchant's mark, and that John should have married Agnes Stokes (<i>d</i>. 1484), the sister of William's wife, Margaret. John Browne was alderman of Stamford in 1448, 1453, and 1462, but is unlikely to have been the man of that name who was a JP in the Holland division of Lincolnshire and served on a number of royal commissions. In November 1450, as John Browne of Stamford, he was accused of engaging in treasonable acts in that town in support of the duke of York. He is reputed to have joined his brother in the rebuilding of All Saints' Church, but not in the founding of Browne's Hospital. However, he left significant memorials of a different kind. He commissioned a fine Flemish book of hours (now Free Library of Philadelphia, Widener MS 3) that is notable not only for containing a miniature of himself and his wife kneeling at the mass of St Gregory, but also for having preserved its original calf binding, the work of Anthonis van Gavere of Bruges, with silver-gilt clasps and John's name and merchant's mark engraved on the back.<br>
<br>John and Agnes Browne are also commemorated by a memorial brass in All Saints' Church. As well as recording the date of John's death (13 February 1476) and the fact that he practised the same craft as his father, its inscription adjures Agnes to become the bride of Christ after her husband's decease. She did not remarry and died in 1484. She and John had a son, Christopher, and two daughters. Christopher Browne (<i>d</i>. 1516) became a merchant of the Calais staple, and in 1480 obtained a grant of arms, thereafter styling himself esquire. It may have been through his links with Calais that he came to throw in his lot with Henry Tudor, whom he joined in exile and with whom he invaded England in 1485. He subsequently joined the court that the new king's mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort, held at Collyweston, just outside Stamford, and himself moved to Tolethorpe nearby. Although he was three times sheriff of Rutland, a JP in three counties, and mayor of the Boston staple in 1500, he did not sever his links with Stamford, serving both as alderman and MP for the borough on three separate occasions. He was married twice, to Grace, daughter of the lawyer John Pinchbeck, and to Agnes Bedingfeld, a member of a leading Norfolk gentry family. His numerous descendants included the religious separatist Robert Browne.<br>
