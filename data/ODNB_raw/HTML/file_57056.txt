<span class="headword">Kingston,  Gertrude</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Gertrude Angela Kohnstamm]</span>  (1862&#150;1937), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born at Durham House, Highbury New Park, Islington, London, on 24 September 1862, the daughter of Heiman Kohnstamm, merchant, and his wife, Teresina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Friedmann. Edwin Max Kohnstamm 
    (later Konstam; 1870&#150;1956)
  , a county court judge, was her brother. She was educated at home for the first years of her life, and travelled widely with her mother and governess. When her artistic talents became obvious, she was sent abroad to study painting in Berlin and Paris, under Carolus-Duran, Henner, and Goussot, afterwards publishing three illustrated books. She began her stage career as an amateur while still a child, imitating popular actors such as Irving and Berhardt. At the age of fifteen she was chosen by W. S. Gilbert to play the lead in an amateur production of his <span class="italic">Broken Hearts</span>. However, painting remained her first love, and it was not until her marriage that she considered pursuing a career as an actress.<br>
<br>On 31 July 1889, in the parish of St George, Hanover Square, she married George Silver (1858/9&#150;1899), a captain in the East Surrey regiment and the son of James Silver of the Madras civil service. She decided to take to the stage as a means of supporting them both, Silver's income being insufficient. At the recommendation of Ellen Terry she became a pupil of Miss Sarah Thorne at Margate, adopting the name Kingston for stage purposes, and appearing in a number of roles including Ophelia in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> and Emilia in <span class="italic">Othello</span>. Shortly afterwards she was invited by Beerbohm Tree to appear as Mrs Harkaway in <span class="italic">Partners</span>, although she later regretted accepting the role, feeling that she was unable to return to tragic acting, having become typecast as &#145;clever&#146; at comedy. Yet after this first appearance she achieved considerable success on the London stage. She became well known and in demand for a variety of roles, including that of Clara Dexter in <span class="italic">The Woodbarrow</span>, which she also produced, and that of Mrs Graves in <span class="italic">A Matchmaker</span>, which she co-wrote with Clotilde Graves and which was criticized for its equation of marriage with prostitution.<br>
<br>In 1899 Kingston was widowed, her husband dying of heart failure just as war broke out in South Africa. By then she was sufficiently influential to raise subscriptions for the actors' and actresses' hospital hut to be set up in Cape Town for soldiers fighting in the South African War. In her autobiography she wrote of her regret that she was dissuaded from volunteering to nurse there herself, feeling that this would have been a valuable opportunity to gain medical training to be put to use in the First World War. However, several accounts of her life suggest that she did serve there, and was mentioned in dispatches. For the next ten years she remained active on the stage, most notably appearing in Euripides' <span class="italic">The Trojan Women</span> as Helen, at the suggestion of George Bernard Shaw. Many felt that this was her finest performance.<br>
<br>In 1910 Kingston became the lessee of the Little Theatre in the Adelphi, London, which was built largely to her specification and was the first British theatre to adopt certain lighting techniques, including &#145;dimmer&#146; lights, which had been invented in the United States. Her season at the Little was inspired by the Royal Court's introduction of highbrow and classical drama to a commercial audience, and thus opened with Aristophanes' <span class="italic">Lysistrata</span>, in which she played the title role. Lillah Macarthy took over the management of the Little Theatre in 1911, yet in 1912 Kingston returned to play Madame Arcadina in <span class="italic">The Seagull</span>. Later that year she appeared as Lady Cecily Waynflete in <span class="italic">Captain Brassbound's Conversion</span>. She then took the leading role in the opening run of <span class="italic">Queen Catherine</span>; this part was written for her by George Bernard Shaw, who regarded her as &#145;the only Queen who could do justice to our combined talents&#146;  (Shaw, 901).<br>
<br>Throughout much of the First World War Kingston was in the United States, speaking about the war effort in Britain and appearing in Boston in a triple bill consisting of <span class="italic">Queen Catherine</span> and two other Shaw plays. She also appeared, in 1916, as Ermyntrude in <span class="italic">The Inca of Perusalem</span> with the Pioneer Players, the suffragist theatre company. Kingston had long been active as a speaker within the suffrage movement, having realized the injustice of her own position as a voteless taxpayer. During the war she also experienced the recurrence of an interest in spiritualism which she had acquired after an experiment in 1905. She felt that she was able to communicate with those who had been killed, and to receive messages from them for their loved ones. Later in life, she also gained comfort from spiritualist communication with her late sister, and through the same means received messages from Oscar Wilde.<br>
<br>After the war Kingston continued to act, and was also much in demand as a public speaker for the Conservative Party, even considering standing for parliament herself in 1924. She also taught public speaking, and wrote numerous articles on a wide range of subjects. In 1927 an exhibition of her work in lacquer was staged in New York, her technique becoming known as Kingston lacquer, and the same year she produced and appeared in <span class="italic">Nevertheless</span> in London. Her final performance was as Queen Elizabeth in <span class="italic">When Essex Died</span> in 1932. She died at the Empire Nursing Home, Vincent Square, Westminster, London, on 7 November 1937. Her own assessment of her career, that it was &#145;a tale of high endeavour and of short results; of big beginnings and little ends; of vital movements railroaded by signals of &#147;blocked line&#148;&#146;  (Kingston, 9) seems modest when set against the record of her achievements in acting, producing, art, politics, and journalism.<br>
