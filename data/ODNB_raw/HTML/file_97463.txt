</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Randle, Sir  Philip John</span>  (1926&#150;2006), <span class="occ">biochemist</span>, was born on 16 July 1926 at 99 Queen's Road, Nuneaton, Warwickshire, the son of Alfred John Randle (<i>d</i>. 1952), master baker, and his wife, Nora Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith (<i>d</i>. 1968), music teacher. He attended King Edward VI Grammar School, Nuneaton, and went on to read natural sciences at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. He obtained a first-class degree in biochemistry in 1947 and then moved to University College Hospital medical school, London, where he completed his medical studies. On 27 September 1952, at the parish church in Nuneaton, he married Elizabeth Ann Harrison (<i>d</i>. 2004), a 21-year-old library assistant, and daughter of Dennis Arthur Harrison, local government officer. They had three daughters and one son.<br>
<br>After qualifying in medicine Randle returned to Cambridge to carry out post-graduate research on insulin under the supervision of Frank Young. He was awarded his PhD in 1955 for a thesis entitled &#145;Studies on the metabolic action of insulin&#146;. This immediately led to his appointment as lecturer in biochemistry at the University of Cambridge, where in 1957 he was also appointed a fellow and director of medical studies at Trinity Hall. He established a research group in a basement laboratory in the Dunn School of Biochemistry in Tennis Court Road. The open drainage system for all the laboratory sinks in the building ran through Randle's laboratory, so that when, as often happened in those days, flammable organic solvents were poured down a sink somewhere in the building the Randle researchers had to beat a hasty retreat&#151;not least because Randle would almost certainly be smoking his pipe.<br>
<br>In Cambridge Randle continued his studies of various aspects of insulin action and the control of metabolism, especially in muscle. These resulted in a series of highly influential papers published in collaboration with an outstanding group of talented young researchers, including Eric Newsholme, Nick Hales, Peter Garland, and Hal Coore. The papers focused on two distinct aspects of the control of mammalian fuel metabolism, both relevant to insulin-dependent diabetes. The first of these, the mechanisms involved in fuel selection by mammalian tissues, was encapsulated in the &#145;glucose&#150;fatty acid cycle&#146; hypothesis (reported in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> in 1963) often subsequently referred to as the Randle cycle; the second aspect, the way in which insulin-producing pancreatic &#946;-cells respond appropriately to changes in blood glucose concentration, became known as the &#145;substrate-site hypothesis&#146;. Validation of these two models and elucidation of the underlying biochemical mechanisms led to decades of research, not only by Randle and his colleagues but also by many other workers in diabetes.<br>
<br>The glucose&#150;fatty acid cycle was based on a series of experiments showing that cardiac and skeletal muscle, when provided with both fatty acids and glucose as potential fuels, preferentially oxidized the fatty acids. This increased supply of fatty acids to muscle could, by diminishing glucose uptake, lead to hyperglycaemia and thereby be involved in the insulin resistance associated with type-2 diabetes and obesity. The fundamental importance of the glucose&#150;fatty acid cycle in the normal physiology of muscle and other tissues soon became widely accepted.<br>
<br>The substrate-site hypothesis for the control of insulin secretion emerged from two ground-breaking advances by the Randle group. The first of these was the development, with Nick Hales, of the radio-immunoassay for insulin (reported in the <span class="italic">Biochemical Journal</span> in 1963), which permitted accurate and precise measurement of the concentration of insulin in biological fluids. The second was the introduction, with Hal Coore, of an <i>in vitro</i> technique for studying the control of insulin release from isolated pieces of rabbit pancreas (reported in the <span class="italic">Biochemical Journal</span> in 1964). Based on the specificity of the secretory response to various sugars and metabolic inhibitors, the novel hypothesis was proposed that rather than binding to some hypothetical cellular receptor, as had been supposed, glucose actually triggered insulin secretion through some product(s) of the metabolism of the sugar within the &#946;-cell. At the time this hypothesis was put forward it was not possible to test it directly since the &#946;-cells made up only a small part (roughly 1 per cent) of the pancreatic mass. However, when methods became available to separate islets of Langerhans (containing predominantly &#946;-cells) from the rest of the pancreas, evidence to support the substrate-site hypothesis was soon forthcoming from studies, published from 1970 onwards, with Steve Ashcroft in the Randle laboratory. Many decades of work were required to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms involved, but the essential role of &#946;-cell glucose metabolism in regulation of insulin secretion was firmly established.<br>
<br>In 1964 Randle was appointed to the newly established chair of biochemistry at the University of Bristol. This was a period of expansion in British universities, but even in that context the rapid development of the department of biochemistry under Randle's leadership was remarkable. Bristol had had medical, veterinary, and dentistry schools for some time, but, although there were a few biochemists working in the departments of physiology, biology, and chemistry, there was no biochemistry department. Within seven years the new department of biochemistry under Randle had become one of the strongest in the country, both for research and for teaching. There were several reasons for this achievement. In the first place Randle made a series of inspired appointments over the entire field of biochemistry including mitochondriology, protein structure, molecular enzymology, and mammalian metabolism. Further, he was highly successful in acquiring sufficient space and funding for the new department from the university. Needless to say his plans did not always meet with whole-hearted support from entrenched interests in existing departments. However, Randle's physical presence (he was well over six feet in height), intellect, and booming voice (accompanied by copious pipe smoke) ensured that his expansionist plans were fulfilled at the critical stage in the development of the department.<br>
<br>The rapidly growing Bristol department of biochemistry was an exciting place to work in during the twelve years that Randle headed it. His influence on the many research students he personally supervised there was immense. His intellectual rigour, his ability to identify and focus upon the essential aspects of important biochemical problems, and his quite remarkable memory for facts, left an indelible impression on all those who worked with him. The young department had a happy atmosphere and a flourishing social life. On Sunday mornings Randle and many of the department were often to be found at the then brand-new university swimming pool. This could occasionally prove hazardous for those who engaged in conversation with Randle while in the pool, since the conversation would usually take place in a part of the pool where he could comfortably stand but most others were required to swim round and round to avoid drowning.<br>
<br>Shortly after moving to Bristol, Randle was invited to give the British Diabetic Association's Banting lecture (1965), and was the first recipient of the prestigious Minkowski prize of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (1966), in connection with which he wrote an important article, &#145;Carbohydrate metabolism and lipid storage and breakdown in diabetes&#146;, published in <span class="italic">Diabetologia</span> the same year. In 1975 he moved to Oxford to found another new department, the Nuffield department of clinical biochemistry. Of his two most long-standing associates, Dick Denton remained in Bristol to continue work on insulin action in adipose and other tissues, while Steve Ashcroft moved with Randle to Oxford to pursue further studies on the substrate-site hypothesis for the control of insulin secretion. In contrast to the large Bristol department, the Nuffield department remained small and highly focused on diabetes-related research, for which it gained an international reputation. Randle continued his own active laboratory research, mainly on the regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, a key regulatory enzyme in adipose tissue and muscle metabolism.<br>
<br>In addition to his university activities Randle took on many other tasks. He was chairman of a large number of research committees and boards for the British Diabetic Association, the Medical Research Council, and the British Heart Foundation; he played a large part in the founding of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes and served as its president from 1977 to 1980; he also was president of the Biochemical Society (1995&#150;2000) and vice-president of the Royal Society (1988&#150;9), of which he was made a fellow in 1983. In the early 1980s he took on an advisory role to the government on aspects of food policy, chairing the influential food policy panel on diet and cardiovascular disease (1981&#150;4). This panel developed recommendations, published in 1984, on lowering intake of unsaturated fats, simple sugars, and salt&#151;advice that remained highly relevant in subsequent years, when clinical obesity was on the increase. His work in all these spheres led to numerous further honours. He gave the Humphry Davy Rolleston lecture of the Royal College of Physicians in 1983, published in the college's journal the following year, was knighted in 1975, and became a founder fellow of the Academy of Medical Science in 1998.<br>
<br>Randle's physical and intellectual stature made him a formidable opponent in scientific debate and he was held in some considerable awe by his colleagues. Nevertheless, beneath a somewhat forbidding exterior he was a warm and generous man who gave great encouragement to those under his wing. He was capable of great kindness and provided real help to his associates if they were in need. Throughout his life he took great pleasure in his family, especially his grandchildren, with whom he spent many happy holidays. He loved opera and the theatre, eating out, and watching television detective series such as <span class="italic">Inspector Morse</span>. He was always a great traveller and made many trips with his wife, Elizabeth, usually when he was invited to give a keynote speech at a meeting in faraway, and often exotic, surroundings.<br>
<br>Randle retired from his Oxford post in 1993. The major international scientific meeting held in his honour that year in Oxford was eloquent testimony to the affection and esteem in which he was regarded throughout the world. His death on 26 September 2006 in Oxford, from a sudden massive intracerebral haemorrhage, marked the end of an era in British diabetes research. He left behind, however, an enormous legacy, both in the Bristol department of biochemistry, which continued to go from strength to strength, and in a worldwide network of researchers whose careers had been substantially enriched by time spent under his supervision. A permanent collection of his published work and other memorabilia was established at the Oxford Centre for Diabetes and Metabolism. He was survived by two daughters, Rosalind and Sally; his son Peter had died in 1971 while still a teenager, and his daughter Susan died in 2005.<br>
