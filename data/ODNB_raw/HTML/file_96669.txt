<span class="headword">Aitken,  Laurel</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Oliver Anthony Stephens]</span>  (1925&#150;2005), <span class="occ">singer, songwriter, and record producer</span>, was born on 22 April 1925, in Jamaica, one of six children of a Jamaican father and a Cuban mother. His early years were spent in Havana, Cuba, but the family moved to Kingston, Jamaica, in 1938. When fifteen years old he reputedly won a talent show at Kingston's Ambassador Theatre with his rendition of &#145;Pennies from Heaven&#146;. Later he worked for the Jamaican tourist board, welcoming arrivals from the incoming cruise ships with currently popular songs. By the early 1950s he had assumed the name Laurel, or sometimes Lorenzo, Aitken, becoming a regular feature on the island's entertainment circuit, performing songs drawn from the popular hits of the American charts as well as jump blues, boogie, rhythm and blues, and indigenous material from the genres of mento and calypso.<br>
<br>Laurel Aitken first recorded at the Motta Recording Studios of Stanley Motta, based at 93 Hanover Street in Kingston. Just around the corner was Motta's store on Harbour Road, where the records were sold. Aitken sang his own composition in the popular mento style &#145;I Met a Senorita&#146;, coupled with a merengue entitled &#145;Merenguita&#146;. Going on to secure a residency at the Colony Club in Half Way Tree, he was able to finance the production of more songs in the studio. His first hit record was a rhythm and blues based calypso&#150;spiritual, &#145;Roll Jordan Roll&#146;, released by another local entrepreneur, Dada Tewari.<br>
<br>Reflecting the common practice of many of the American artists who influenced him, Aitken had two distinct sides to his recorded output. On the one hand he dealt with secular subject matters, usually based around the themes of women, alcohol, and good times; on the other he recorded material that reflected a different context. &#145;Ghana Independence&#146; and &#145;Nebuchanezer&#146; were released about 1957 on Caribou 78s, and he recorded a series of gospel songs for a number of different producers, including &#145;Zion&#146; and &#145;Judgement Day&#146; for Duke Reid, and &#145;What a Weeping&#146; and &#145;Zion City Wall&#146; for Leslie Kong. One unusual element that distinguished many of these recordings was the use of a trio of drums known as the &#145;burro&#146;&#151;bass drum, funde, and repeater&#151;that would later be popularized by Prince Buster's recording of the Folks Brothers' &#145;Oh! Carolina&#146;, the work of Count Ossie and the Mystical Revelation of Rastafari, and eventually too in many examples of the most widespread of Jamaican musical genres, roots reggae.<br>
<br>In 1958 Aitken began recording for the producer Chris Blackwell's newly created Island label. His single &#145;Boogie in My Bones&#146;, backed by &#145;Little Sheila&#146;, was the label's d&eacute;but release and also one of the earliest examples of the emerging genre that was to become known as &#145;ska&#146;&#151;a music indigenous to Jamaica but based on the shuffle blues originating in New Orleans. Aitken had taken a step in this direction the year earlier with the release of &#145;Aitken's Boogie&#146; on Ken Khouri's Federal label. But &#145;Boogie in My Bones&#146; was a huge breakthrough hit in Jamaica and topped the Jamaican Broadcasting Company chart for almost three months. Its success warranted a domestic release in Britain, thereby gaining the distinction of the first Jamaican pop record to be issued there.<br>
<br>In 1960 Emil Shallit's Kalypso label released &#145;Aitken's Boogie&#146; in Britain, and in that year Aitken emigrated to England, settling in Brixton, where there was an established Jamaican community. He was prominent in the development of Shallit's Blue Beat label, a name that became synonymous with the music it showcased, releasing a further sixteen titles on the label over the following few years. Through this decade, as ska changed into rocksteady and rocksteady to reggae, Aitken established himself as a producer. He worked with such bands as the Bees, the Cimarons, and the Rudies, all of whom acted as backing and support bands for Aitken's own material, as well as with the singer Winston Groovy and the all-white reggae band Inner Mind. He also occasionally recorded under the pseudonym King Horror on a number of comedy talk-over deejay tracks such as &#145;Loch Ness Monster&#146;, &#145;Dracula, Prince of Darkness&#146;, and &#145;The Hole&#146;.<br>
<br>Laurel Aitken, Jamaica's first genuine recording star, became famous not only for his groundbreaking and popular records but also for his snappy dress sense, Italian-styled mohair suit, pork pie hat, and shades. His appearance earned him the sobriquets Godfather of Ska and Boss Skinhead, and created an icon that lived on through the 2 Tone era when the sound of ska was revived across Britain by bands like the Specials, Madness, and the Beat. During this period Aitken's career went through a resurgence when he had a hit with &#145;Rudie Got Married&#146; as an answer to the Specials' &#145;A Message to You, Rudie&#146;. In the 1980s he regularly toured the UK and recorded with the British act Potato 5. In 1986 he appeared alongside David Bowie in the film <span class="italic">Absolute Beginners</span>. He also recorded with Japan's Ska Flames, Germany's Busters, and America's Toasters.<br>
<br>In 2003 Aitken was treated for double pneumonia but recovered and went on to perform again; his last concert was in January 2005. Having lived in Leicester since the 1970s, he died at Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, on 17 July 2005, of chronic respiratory failure and heart failure. He was survived by his wife, Sandra Olga Stephens, and his daughter.<br>
