<span class="headword">Ward,  John</span>  (1805&#150;1890), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 28 August 1805 at East Cowes, Isle of Wight, where his father, John Ward, was collector of customs. His mother, Martha (also known as Patty), was one of the four sisters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/686/', "Thomas Arnold (1795&#150;1842)")</script>; his grandfather William Arnold had been his father's predecessor in the customs post. Ward was much influenced by the Arnoldian context in which he was reared and by his uncle's friends, such as Richard Whately. In 1831 he jointly edited with his uncle the short-lived weekly journal the <span class="italic">Englishman's Register</span>, of which Arnold was the proprietor. He abandoned the law, for which he had been trained, on his appointment in 1837 to an inspectorship of prisons. The following year, after acting for some months as private secretary to the first earl of Durham, he became through the earl's influence secretary to the New Zealand Colonization Company, for which he wrote <span class="italic">The British Colonization of New Zealand</span> (1837), with E. G. Wakefield, and <span class="italic">Information Relative to New Zealand</span> (1839; 2nd enlarged edn, 1840). He had for many years previously taken a keen interest in the politics, and more especially in the commercial and industrial progress, of France, Belgium, and Germany, and had published articles on both home and foreign affairs in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> and the <span class="italic">British and Foreign Review</span>. Early in 1841 he was appointed British commissioner for the revision of the state tolls. In 1844 he was sent to Berlin as British commissioner for the settlement, through the arbitration of the king of Prussia, of the so-called Portendic claims on France, arising out of a blockade by French ships of part of the African coast. In the summer of 1845 Lord Aberdeen appointed him consul-general at Leipzig, with the further commission to visit periodically those places in Germany where the conferences of the Zollverein should be held. At the close of 1850 Lord Palmerston instructed him to act as secretary of legation at Dresden during the diplomatic conferences held in that capital, where he was a close witness of the notable victory achieved by the policy of Austria, represented by Schwarzenberg. In 1854 he attended the Munich exhibition of arts and manufactures, and wrote a report on the state of technical instruction in Bavaria. In 1857 he was charged with an inquiry into the political condition of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, their relations with the Danish crown, and the best remedies for grievances which the promulgation of the joint constitution of 1855 had notoriously augmented. His report, though praised by the prince consort and Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, was left unpublished by Lord Clarendon, and the subsequent course of events prevented any possibility of acting on his recommendation to reorganize the Danish monarchy upon federal principles.<br>
<br>In 1860 Ward, after being made a CB, had been nominated charg&eacute; d'affaires and consul-general for the Hanse towns and the surrounding parts of Germany, and after in 1865 negotiating, together with Lord Napier and Ettrick, a commercial treaty with the Zollverein, he was in the following year raised to the rank of minister-resident. In 1870, owing to the abolition of direct diplomatic relations with the Hanse towns on their joining the North German federation, he left Hamburg. The remainder of his life he spent in retirement at Dover and in Essex (where his home was Gaston House, near Bishop's Stortford), writing his reminiscences. Ward was married to Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1905), daughter of John Bullock, rector of Radwinter, Essex. The second of their sons was the historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36726/', "Sir Adolphus Ward")</script>. Ward died at his home in Kent, 11 Waterloo Crescent, Dover, on 1 September 1890.<br>
