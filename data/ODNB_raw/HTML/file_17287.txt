<span class="headword">Lyon,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1617), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Cork</span>, was born in Chester; little is known about his early career. He may have been educated at Oxford University, though Justice Saxey said that he had been &#145;some time a tapster [innkeeper] by London way&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/216/59), while yet another source stated that he had been a seafarer in his youth. In 1595 he claimed to have been in Ireland for twenty-five years, suggesting that he had arrived in 1570. On 6 November 1573 he was presented to the vicarage of Naas (co. Kildare), to which he added Bodenstown (co. Kildare) on 23 July 1580; but it is not clear whether he was always resident, since on 24 November 1577 he had received permission to hold two Irish benefices while living in England. By the early 1580s he was certainly in Ireland, serving as chaplain to Lord Deputy Grey, and accepting in 1582 the impoverished southern see of Ross (nominated 30 March, letters patent 12 May). By August 1582 Grey had granted Lyon the profits of the neighbouring see of Cork, and the mayor of Cork soon petitioned for Lyon to be made bishop. As early as April 1583 he was termed bishop of Ross and Cork. In November 1583 he was granted Cork <i>in commendam</i>, and finally on 24 March 1586 the queen ordered that it be annexed to Ross, along with the adjacent see of Cloyne. His wife was called Elizabeth; they had a son, William, and two daughters, Mary and Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Lyon was that rarity in late-sixteenth century Ireland, an active, resident English bishop. He played his part to the full as a local official: he served on the commissions for ecclesiastical causes in Munster of 1583 and 1594, on the national commission of 1602, and on the civil commission for the government of Munster during the 1590s, and he reported regularly to Dublin and London about political and religious affairs in the province. But his long episcopate was far from easy. The first part was punctuated by wars and upheavals: the Desmond rising of 1579&#150;83, followed by the Munster plantation, and then by the Nine Years' War (1594&#150;1603), which reached its devastating climax in Munster. Moreover, these military struggles became intertwined with the fierce contest between Reformation and Counter-Reformation for the religious loyalty of the people. As if this was not enough Lyon also struggled with a serious financial crisis as his Irish predecessors, seeing little future for themselves in the Church of Ireland, had leased out episcopal endowments. Cork and Ross were worth only &pound;70 p.a. when he became bishop, Cloyne even less, his predecessor having granted it away in fee farm for a rent of only &pound;3 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. p.a., leaving Lyon without even a residence there.<br>
<br>Initially Lyon made progress in establishing conformity, if not protestantism. He himself contributed to the building of a see house (at a cost of &pound;300), a church, a free school, and even a bridge, in Ross, and provided new testaments and prayer and schoolbooks (albeit in English and Latin). By 1589 he had, according to Lord Deputy Fitzwilliam,<blockquote>reformed so many people, which at his coming unto these parts are most wild and disordered, by informing them in the principles of religion, as they are not only become thereby so obedient to law &hellip; but also are so forward to have the word of God preached, and to communicate, as it is wonderful &hellip; that one age, much less one man, not learned in their own language, in so short a time, could have wrought them to like perfection. (TNA: PRO, SP 63/142/9)</blockquote>But it was always an uphill task. Visitations of his dioceses from the early 1590s reveal serious problems. Though a core of local Irish and Anglo-Irish clergy remained, lay invasion of church property, rampant pluralism, and the large number of vacant and impropriate benefices without cure, suggested that the Church of Ireland was struggling pastorally. In all there were about thirty clergy in Cloyne, nearly all reading ministers, serving 125 benefices, fifty-five of which were vacant.<br>
<br>Lyon confirmed the general picture of decline. In 1595 he wrote to Burghley complaining that because of the suspension of the laws against recusancy and the activities of the Catholic clergy, the supply of clergy and parishioners had dried up. Existing ministers were leaving to become &#145;massing priests&#146;; replacements, especially Irish born preachers, were impossible to find. The people, heeding the warnings of the priests that the Church of Ireland liturgy was the &#145;devil's service&#146;, were refusing to come to church. &#145;Within these two years &hellip; where I have had a thousand or more in a church at sermon, I now have not five&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/183/47). In 1598 his house at Ross was destroyed by a local chieftain. In 1604 Lyon reported again. He found the mere &#145;face of a church&#146;, &#145;torn and rent&#146;, and &#145;overwhelmed with the palpable darkness of idolatry&#146;, with &#145;few qualified incumbents&#146;. Throughout his dioceses &#145;no marriages, christenings, &amp;c&#146; had been done &#145;but by Papist priests this seven years&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/221/35A). Lyon's reports are, it is true, not devoid of special pleading. Convinced that Roman Catholicism was inherently antichristian and disloyal, he believed that missionary activity needed to be backed up by firm civil measures to enforce conformity, something which the politic Burghley was unwilling to do after the outbreak of the Nine Years' War.<br>
<br>In fact, the shift in religious attitudes was much too deep to be changed by official coercion, as became evident when Lyon set about rebuilding the church after the coming of peace in 1603. Under the aggressive lord president, Sir Henry Brouncker, a religious experiment was conducted in Munster. Brouncker used his powers to the full to force recusants to come to church, while Lyon sought to create a fresh ministry to accommodate the new parishioners. The impact of fines and imprisonment did produce a temporary increase in conformists, at least in the cities where there were preachers, but the Catholic leaders proved defiant, and the disruption caused to the civil life of the province by the harsh enforcement measures led the English privy council to order the suspension of the campaign.<br>
<br>The future for the Church of Ireland in Munster lay with the growing community of English colonists. Lyon attracted university educated clergy from England by uniting five or six benefices. By 1615 the ministry was very different from the 1590s. The old local clergy had almost disappeared, replaced by &eacute;migr&eacute;s. In Cloyne there were thirty-five resident clergy, of whom fifteen were now preachers. The quality of the ministry had thus improved, but its coverage was mostly limited to the areas of English settlement. Underpinning the changes in ministry were improvements in the church's finances. Lyon spent a considerable amount of time during the second part of his episcopate in seeking to recover church property. He compiled a terrier for Cloyne, in preparation for a lengthy, though unsuccessful, battle in the courts and parliament to recover the see lands. He built a palace at Cork at a cost of over &pound;1000, and managed to raise his overall income by 1615 to &pound;200 p.a.<br>
<br>Lyon died on 4 October 1617. In 1849 his tomb (built, rather pessimistically, in 1597) was discovered near the see house in Cork, and his remains removed to the cathedral. As with his background, there are conflicting accounts of Lyon's abilities. Saxey thought him &#145;utterly unlearned&#146;  (SP 63/216/59), but he impressed Brouncker as a man &#145;whose piety, courage and honesty I cannot commend sufficiently&#146;  (SP 63/219/134). Brouncker was of course Lyon's ally, and Saxey was notably dismissive of Irish clerics. The truth probably lies in between&#151;certainly the evidence of the visitations and his surviving correspondence suggests a competent and dedicated administrator struggling with a difficult task.<br>
