<span class="headword">Lanyon, Sir  Charles</span>  (1813&#150;1889), <span class="occ">architect and engineer</span>, son of John Jenkinson Lanyon (1770/71&#150;1835) of Eastbourne, Sussex, and his wife, Catherine Anne Mortimer (1772/3&#150;1840), was born at Eastbourne, Sussex, on 6 January 1813. Having received his early education at a private school in Eastbourne, he was articled to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21011/', "Jacob Owen")</script> of the Royal Engineers' department in Portsmouth, later of the Irish board of works, Dublin, in preparation for the profession of civil engineer. On 2 February 1837 he married Owen's daughter Elizabeth Helen (<i>d</i>. 1858); they had ten children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16060/', "Sir (William) Owen Lanyon")</script>. In 1835, at the first examination for Irish county surveyorships, Lanyon took second place; he was appointed county surveyor of Kildare, and in the following year transferred at his own request to co. Antrim. Here he executed several works of great importance, among others the constructing of the great Antrim coast road from Larne to Portrush, and he designed and erected many bridges in the county, including the viaduct of 1837 at Glendun and the Ormeau Bridge of 1860&#150;63 over the Lagan at Belfast. He laid out several of the chief local railways, such as the Belfast and Ballymena line and its extensions to Cookstown and Portrush, later amalgamated with other lines to form part of the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway. He was also engineer of the Belfast, Holywood, and Bangor Railway, and the Carrickfergus and Larne line. He was architect of some of the principal buildings in Belfast, such as the Queen's College, now Queen's University (1846&#150;9), the court house (1848&#150;50), the county gaol (1843&#150;5), the custom house (1854&#150;7), and the Institute for the Deaf and Dumb and Blind (1843&#150;5; dem. 1965). His palm house in the botanic gardens, Belfast, built in two phases between 1840 and 1852, although small, is notable as one of the earliest examples of curvilinear iron and glass anywhere. Much of Lanyon's work was carried out in private practice, in which he was assisted by two partners, first <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63609/', "W. H. Lynn (1829&#150;1915)")</script>, from 1854, and then his own eldest son, John (1839&#150;1900), from 1860. The joint firm was one of the most prolific in Ireland, responsible for many churches, banks, and country houses throughout Ireland.<br>
<br>Lanyon resigned the county surveyorship in 1860, and then retired from practice completely following the breakup of his firm in 1872, to devote his energies to public life, in which he was already involved. In 1862 he became mayor of Belfast, and in 1866 Conservative member of parliament for the town. In 1868 he was defeated at the polls. In 1876 he served as high sheriff of co. Antrim. He was one of the Belfast harbour commissioners and a deputy lieutenant and magistrate of the county. In 1862 he was elected president of the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland, and held office until 1868, when he was knighted by the duke of Abercorn, then lord lieutenant. He was also a fellow of the Institute of British Architects and a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers of both England and Ireland. For a long time he was a prominent member of the masonic body, in which he rose to be grand master of the province of Antrim. He died, after a protracted illness, at his residence, The Abbey, White Abbey, co. Antrim, on 31 May 1889, and was buried on 4 June in the churchyard of Knockbreda, near Belfast.<br>
