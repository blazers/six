<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dollar,  Robert McVey</span>  (1844&#150;1932), <span class="occ">shipowner and philanthropist</span>, was born at Falkirk, Stirlingshire, on 20 March 1844 (and baptized there on 5 April), the eldest son of William Dollar (<i>d</i>. 1873) and his wife, Mary Wilson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Melville (1814/15&#150;1853). His father managed the timber yard of his father-in-law, Robert Melville, a prosperous man whose family were also shipowners. Robert and his younger brothers, John Melville (<i>b</i>. 1846) and James (<i>b</i>. 1849), grew up in a close-knit family and they were to stay together for the rest of their lives. When their mother died in 1853, followed by their maternal grandfather in 1854, their father took to the bottle, making Robert a lifelong teetotaller. After attending parish school he started work in a lathe shop at the age of twelve. His father was married again, in 1856, to Mary Easton, whose family were also in the timber trade. The following year William Dollar took his young family to Canada, where he managed a sawmill owned by his new wife's cousin Charles Easton.<br>
<br>At the time much of the Canadian timber trade was in the hands of Scottish merchants, notably the Glasgow firm of Pollok Gilmour &amp; Co. In Canada Robert Dollar followed the family calling into the timber trade, becoming at the age of nineteen a logger, with the hazardous task of rafting logs downstream to the mills. With his brother John he bought a farm in 1863 by scrimping and saving from their wages. The following year at Gatineau in Quebec, where he was working as a cook, he began to teach himself bookkeeping. He was surprised at his studies by the manager, who did not dismiss him for using the company's time for such a purpose, but instead provided him with books. Promotion followed as a clerk in a remote camp, 150 miles from the nearest inhabitants, and in 1866 as a manager in charge of forty men. From 1870 to 1872 he was working for Pearly and Pattee on the Coulonge River, making a success of building dams to improve the flow of the current to carry logs downstream. By this time he had saved enough to go into business in the Muskoka district of Ontario, buying timber and starting a mill at Bracebridge. This early venture was overwhelmed by the black Friday panic on Wall Street in 1873, resulting in a loss of $5000. While he was working to pay off his debts he married, in 1874, Margaret Proudfoot, with whom he had four children, Alexander Melville (1878), Robert Stanley (1880), Mary Grace (1885), and John Harold (1887).<br>
<br>Free of debt in 1876 Dollar went back into business, opening no fewer than eight camps in the Muskoka district. This time he prospered and in 1880 began to export square timber to England, going further afield in Ontario in search of supplies. This led him in 1882 to move his operations to Michigan, where larger timber, suitable for the English market, was more plentiful. Settling at Marquette he built a mill beside the railtrack in the country to the west of Newberry, which he named Dollarville. Using all his spare cash he bought a large tract of federal-owned forest, yielding a handsome profit. As well as managing his own affairs, he started an operation for the British Canadian Lumber Company. Running a lumber business involved incessant travelling in search of customers. During 1887 he covered more than 30,000 miles. Rheumatism brought on by years in logging camps during the harsh Canadian winter, and his growing trade with the United Kingdom, led him to return to Scotland for the first time in 1884. Visiting his mother's grave in Falkirk he noticed that the town did not have a library. Mindful that &#145;no town in the United States of the size of it would have been without a library&#146;, he donated &pound;1000 &#145;to start a good sized library&#146;  (Dollar, 1.25).<br>
<br>On another trip to escape the cold Dollar visited California and decided to move to San Francisco with his brothers in 1888, buying the last remaining redwood forest, the Meeker tract on the Russian River in Sonoma county in the north. He was naturalized an American citizen in that year. He built a mill in 1893 on the coast at Usal, which he ran for six years. Finding it difficult to charter vessels to bring out his timber, he followed in his grandfather's footsteps and bought his first steamer, <i>Newsboy</i>, in 1895, laying the foundations of what was to become the Dollar line with its characteristic black smoke stack and white $ sign. The purchase coincided with the Klondike gold rush, which increased demand for shipping up the west coast. By the end of the century he owned four ships.<br>
<br>Just as he had done on the east coast Robert Dollar began to explore the possibilities of the export market, entering the China trade in the aftermath of the Boxer rebellion in 1901. As was his custom he visited China with his wife in 1902 to establish a market for timber and investigate the opportunity for exports and trade elsewhere in the Pacific. This began a period of nearly incessant travel around the Pacific for almost the rest of his life. He became a &#145;kenspeckle&#146; figure in the Orient, making friends of emperors, presidents, and merchants and earning the title of Captain Dollar, though he was not himself a mariner. As he reflected, &#145;The first principle of trade is to get acquainted and to be friendly with whom you trade&#146;  (Dollar, 1.145). He was quick to see the potential of trade with both China and Japan, his fleet transporting lumber from the Pacific coast of America and returning with cargoes of low-cost iron from China, together with immigrants carried in steerage. His approach to both countries was coloured by contact with Christian missionaries, whose work he praised constantly. He was also a stern critic of those who wished to grant independence to the Philippines, which had become an American territory in 1902, believing that American investment was an essential ingredient for prosperity.<br>
<br>After the First World War, which had proved profitable for his shipping line, Dollar fiercely attacked the United States shipping board for its lack of vision in failing to develop the American merchant marine. He regarded a national merchant shipping fleet as fundamental to American trade. Having failed to persuade the board to commence a round-the-world shipping service he set out to prove the potential. In 1920 he had told his sons, all of whom were working for the line, to begin buying stock in competitors so as to gain a controlling interest, while acquiring surplus ships at discount prices. Four years later he acquired the Pacific Steamship Company and inaugurated his own round-the-world service with ships purchased from the board. By 1926 the Dollar family had a near monopoly of the Pacific trade and the round-the-world service was carrying over 45,000 passengers a year, yielding a profit of $6 million. Although Robert Dollar had condemned mail subsidies before the war he was quick to bid for them in the more uncertain economic times of 1928. Winning a lucrative contract he borrowed heavily to build six new mail liners, only two of which entered service, <i>President Hoover</i> and <i>President Coolidge</i> in 1931. By then the trade depression had placed the shipping line heavily in debt, increased by the move into the passenger business initiated by his son Robert, who was nominally vice-president but effectively in charge of business decisions.<br>
<br>Dollar had kept a diary for much of his North American life, and privately printed the first of four volumes of memoirs in 1918, emphasizing his early struggles, setting out his business precepts, and recording his travels and philanthropy. He gave freely to charities both in San Rafael and elsewhere, including his native Falkirk, where on being made freeman on a visit in August 1912 he gave money for a monument and drinking fountain in memory of Sir John de Graham, the Scottish patriot who fell at the battle of Falkirk in 1298. He purchased the Arnotdale estate for &pound;5600 in 1920 and donated it to Falkirk as a public park, which was renamed Dollar Park in his honour. He gave money for new stairs to the pulpit in the parish kirk in 1896 and in 1926 a set of chimes so that hymns could be played at eight o'clock every morning as well as for divine services. His return to Falkirk in March 1924 to celebrate his eightieth birthday was marked by speeches on the theme of &#145;the dear auld hame&#146;; he made a last visit home in July 1928, when he presented two stone lions to be placed at the entrance to Dollar Park.<br>
<br>Dollar died on 16 May 1932, of pneumonia, at his home, Falkirk, San Rafael, California, which he had purchased in 1906 and is now reserved as a historical community centre for the arts. He was a devoted family man, each morning beginning with readings from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and closing with a walk in the grounds with his grandchildren. One of a number of Scots who made fortunes in North America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, but who did not forget their native land, Dollar is estimated to have made a fortune of over $40 million.<br>
