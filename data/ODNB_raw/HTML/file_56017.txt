<span class="headword">Morrison,  William Douglas</span>  (1852&#150;1943), <span class="occ">criminologist and prison chaplain</span>, was born at Kirriemuir, Forfarshire, on 15 May 1852, the son of Robert Southmuir Morrison, a merchant, and Ann Donald-William. Educated at nearby Trinity College, Glenalmond, he was ordained deacon in 1877 and priest in 1878 by the bishop of Ripon. From 1877 to 1883 he was a curate: first at Sandal Magna, then at St John's, Wakefield. He was appointed assistant chaplain at Wakefield prison in 1883, moving in 1887 to Wandsworth prison. Marrying this practical experience with voracious reading, he turned himself into one of the foremost authorities on crime and prisons in the country.<br>
<br>In 1889 Morrison published <span class="italic">The Jews under the Roman Empire</span>. This was followed by a spate of criminological works. His books <span class="italic">Crime and its Causes</span> (1891) and <span class="italic">Juvenile Offenders</span> (1896) were widely read. Morrison was attracted by the Italian positivist school, particularly by its renunciation of repressive punishment and by the principle that sentences needed to be individualized according to the characteristics of offenders. But he was never a true convert. He accepted that criminals were a &#145;degenerate class&#146; produced by the &#145;anomalous biological and social conditions&#146; of urban life, but rejected the pessimistic view that criminality was innate and associated with distinctive physiological or mental characteristics, believing rather that the &#145;prison look&#146; was &#145;prison made&#146;. Furthermore, he came to appreciate the injustices to which indeterminate sentences could lead. Morrison edited the first criminological series to be published in England, including translations of Enrico Ferri's <span class="italic">Criminal Sociology</span> (1895) and Cesare Lombroso and William Ferrero's <span class="italic">The Female Offender</span> (1895), and published at least fourteen articles in a wide range of learned and more popular periodicals. In 1898 the University of St Andrews conferred on him an honorary LLD.<br>
<br>Although undoubtedly learned, Morrison was more a controversialist than a social scientist and was accused, sometimes justifiably, of drawing inferences to suit his argument. A tall, distinguished looking man of great determination, he was a Christian socialist and progressive Liberal. A member of the Reform Club, he was also active in Henry Salt's Humanitarian League. In January 1894 the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span> published a series of damning articles on the prison system, &#145;Our dark places&#146;. The articles were almost certainly written by the assistant editor Henry Massingham, but Morrison undoubtedly provided much of the fuel. In April 1894 he savagely attacked Sir Edmund Du Cane's stewardship of the prison system in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>. His article, &#145;Are our prisons a failure?&#146;, claimed that the system created recidivism by its inhumane insistence on relentless discipline, uniformly applied. Contrary to some accounts, Du Cane did not sack him. A departmental committee on prisons (chaired by Herbert Gladstone) was set up to which Morrison gave extensive critical evidence. When its progressive report was published in 1895 both R. B. Haldane, a member of the committee, and Massingham in the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span> paid tribute to Morrison for being &#145;the real instrument&#146; of the changes and as one of &#145;the great prison reformers&#146;. Yet, disappointed at the slow progress of reform, he continued to be a thorn in the flesh of the administration. He was regarded as &#145;a dangerous man&#146; not only by Du Cane but also by his more progressive successor, Sir Evelyn Ruggles-Brise. Morrison drew attention to the plight of Oscar Wilde, and played a part in getting him transferred from Wandsworth to better conditions at Reading gaol.<br>
<br>In 1898 Morrison left the prison service. Over the next ten years he was a member of staff first of the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span> and then of <span class="italic">The Nation</span>. He edited four religious works but still continued to write on criminological themes, publishing his last article in the <span class="italic">Sociological Review</span> in 1908. In that year he obtained the crown living of St Marylebone, a post which he held until 1941. He was knocked down by a motorcycle on 13 December 1943, and died the same day at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington East, London, aged ninety-one, his criminological fame forgotten by his obituarists. He was survived by his wife, Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Butler, and by their son and their daughter, who was the wife of Sir Albert Dykes Spicer, second baronet.<br>
