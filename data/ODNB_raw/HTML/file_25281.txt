<span class="headword">Shearman,  William</span>  (1767&#150;1861), <span class="occ">physician and medical writer</span>, born at Harwich in January 1767, graduated MD at Edinburgh on 12 September 1807 (with a dissertation on pneumonia), and was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, London, on 11 April 1808. In 1799 he had been appointed one of the staff of a periodical called <span class="italic">The New Medical and Physical Journal, or, Annals of Medicine, Natural History, and Chemistry</span>, and from 1810 to 1812 he was its editor. He continued his connection with the publication until 1815. Shearman contributed articles on a variety of topics to <span class="italic">Medical Reports</span> in 1824 and also published independently.<br>
<br>Shearman commenced practice as a physician in London, and then worked for a while in Maidstone before returning to London in 1813. He practised for many years in Northampton Square, Clerkenwell, and subsequently, until his death, at 17 Canonbury Villas, Islington. He was physician to the London Dispensary from 1813 to 1824, to the Infirmary for Children in Waterloo Road from 1816, and to the West London Infirmary and Lying-in Institution in Villiers Street from 1821. He was the senior member of the medical staff when the institution in Villiers Street became the Charing Cross Hospital, and he retained his position in the new hospital until 1852, when he became consulting physician. He gave annual lectures on the theory and practice of medicine at the Charing Cross Hospital school of medicine.<br>
<br>For several years Shearman was treasurer to the Medical Society of London. In 1824 he was president of the society, and in 1834 he published an oration delivered before it. Shearman was survived by at least two daughters, but the identity of his wife and any other family is not known. He died at his home on 21 November 1861, at the age of ninety-four, and was buried at Highgate cemetery in north London. Described by an obituarist as &#145;quite one of the old school of physicians [who] set his face strongly against the &#147;new-fangled doctrines&#148; of modern times&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lancet</span>, 536), he was nevertheless so respected that all lectures and teaching at Charing Cross medical school were suspended on 29 November, the day of his funeral.<br>
