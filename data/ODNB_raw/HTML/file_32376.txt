<span class="headword">Charteris,  Archibald Hamilton</span>  (1835&#150;1908), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and biblical scholar</span>, born at the schoolhouse in Wamphray, Dumfriesshire, on 13 December 1835, was the eldest son of John Charteris, the parish schoolmaster, and his wife, Jean Hamilton. From his parish school he passed to Edinburgh University, where he graduated BA in 1852 and MA in 1853. Having entered the Church of Scotland ministry he was presented to the parish of St Quivox, Ayrshire, and ordained in 1858, but in the following year became minister of New Abbey parish in Kirkcudbrightshire (where he initiated a movement for the preservation of the ruins of Sweetheart Abbey), of which James Hamilton, his maternal uncle, had been minister from 1813 to 1858. While there he wrote the biography of James Robertson (1802&#150;1869), founder of the endowment scheme of the Church of Scotland, whose eager and energetic churchmanship Charteris inherited. The biography was published in Edinburgh in 1863 and abridged as <span class="italic">A Faithful Churchman</span> in the <span class="roman">Church of Scotland Guild Library</span> series in 1897. In 1863 Charteris succeeded John Caird as minister of Park Church, Glasgow, where his preaching and his work among the young attracted attention. On 24 November 1863 he married Catherine Morice [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48850/', "Charteris, Catherine Morice (1837&#150;1918)")</script>], daughter of Sir Alexander Anderson, lord provost of Aberdeen; they had no children.<br>
<br>After some time spent abroad on account of ill health, Charteris became, in 1868, professor of biblical criticism in Edinburgh University, retaining the post until 1898. He was strongly conservative, being mainly concerned with the unity, catholicity, and authority of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and little concerned with more recent biblical criticism. His most notable work, <span class="italic">Canonicity: a Collection of Early Testimonies to the Canonical Books of the New Testament</span> (1880), based on Joannes Kirchhofer's <span class="italic">Quellensammlung</span> (1844), was commended by Adolf Hilgenfeld, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Godet, and William Sanday. He also published <span class="italic">The New Testament Scriptures: their Claims, History, and Authority</span> (Croall lecture, 1882) and his Baird lecturer for 1887, <span class="italic">The Church of Christ: its Life and Work</span> (1905).<br>
<br>Charteris always retained the outlook of a parish minister. He was mainly responsible for a renewal of vitality within the national church, and achieved a marked revival of practical Christian effort and a sense of Christian mission, both local and national. His reputation as &#145;the gentlest man in the assembly&#146;  (Burleigh, 391) served to persuade the general assembly to adopt and support his many schemes. He was the founder, and from 1871 to 1894 convener, of the general assembly's Christian life and work committee, which inaugurated many new forms of Christian enterprise: under his guidance it originated the Young Men's Guild and the Young Women's Guild. He also revived the order of deaconesses, taking a lead in founding at Edinburgh the Deaconess Institution and Training Home, and the Deaconess Hospital. He recognized the importance of contemporary means and styles of communication in bringing information regarding the work of the church into the homes of its people, and in January 1879 started, and was the first editor of, <span class="italic">Life and Work</span>, the monthly magazine of the Church of Scotland. The first issue sold 76,000 copies, with the circulation rising to 270,000 in the 1930s; in the 1990s it had an average circulation of 60,000 copies. He originated and promoted Advance, a scheme to rebuild the Church of Scotland's foreign missions, which had been left with only one agent after the Disruption of 1843; it met with much success, new mission fields opening in Africa (Blantyre, 1874) and China (Ichang (Yichang), 1878). Charteris also rendered conspicuous service as vice-convener of the general assembly's committee for the abolition of patronage and of the endowment committee, and promoted the cause of church reunion within Scotland. His leadership, which contributed greatly to the recovery of the national church in the difficult decades after the Disruption, was recognized when he was elected moderator of the general assembly in 1892.<br>
<br>Charteris was one of the royal chaplains in Scotland from 1870, and received the honorary degrees of DD (1868) and LLD (1898) from Edinburgh University. After some years of ill health he died on 24 April 1908 at 58 Melville Street, Edinburgh, and was buried on 28 April at Wamphray. The Charteris Memorial Church (now Kirk o' Field) was erected in the Pleasance, Edinburgh, in 1911.<br>
