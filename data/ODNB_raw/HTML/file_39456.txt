<span class="headword">Montefiore <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fuller]</span>,  Dora Frances  Barrow</span>  (1851&#150;1933), <span class="occ">suffragist</span>, was born on 20 December 1851 and baptized (as Dora Frances) on 18 January 1852 at St Nicholas's Church, Tooting Graveney, the eighth of thirteen children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41319/', "Francis Fuller (1807&#150;1887)")</script>, surveyor and railway entrepreneur, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Drew. Educated at home at Kenley Manor, Surrey, and then at a private school in Brighton, Dora Fuller became her father's amanuensis. In 1874 she went to keep house for her eldest brother in Australia, where she met George Barrow Montefiore, a merchant. After their marriage on 1 February 1881, they lived prosperously in Sydney, where their daughter was born in 1883 and their son in 1887. On being widowed on 17 July 1889, Dora Montefiore discovered that she had no rights of guardianship over her own children unless her husband had willed them to her. She therefore became an advocate of women's rights. The first meeting of the Womanhood Suffrage League of New South Wales was held at her home on 29 March 1891. Dora Montefiore became its corresponding secretary but by 1892 had returned to Europe with her children, first to Paris and finally to England.<br>
<br>Dora Montefiore's suffragism continued through a range of organizations: the National Society for Women's Suffrage, the League of Practical Suffragists, and later the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). Never just a member on paper she was on the executive of the first, wrote a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Women Uitlanders</span> (1899), for the second, and was for a time an active WSPU organizer in London. She was also part of a network of correspondents centred on Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy. In 1906 Dora Montefiore's Hammersmith home was besieged by bailiffs for six weeks because of her refusal of taxation without representation. Later that year she was sent to Holloway prison after being arrested at a WSPU lobby of parliament. This experience, coupled with severe doubts concerning the WSPU, prompted her resignation even though it cost her cherished friends. In 1907 Montefiore joined the Adult Suffrage Society and was elected its honorary secretary in 1909.<br>
<br>The vote was never an isolated issue for Dora Montefiore. From the 1890s she sought an organization which reflected her evolving politics. Although for a time a member of the Women's Liberal Association, working for the election of women to local government, Montefiore was soon moving towards socialism and the Marxist Social Democratic Federation (SDF). In 1903 she was elected for the first time to the party's executive. Within the SDF she developed a woman-focused socialism and helped set up the party's women's organization in 1904. An energetic although often dissident worker for the SDF until the end of 1912, Montefiore resigned from what had become the British Socialist Party as an anti-militarist, only to return in 1916. She spoke at the Leeds &#145;Soviet&#146; in 1917 and was a founder member of the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1920, serving on its first executive. Having become politically active in her late forties, Montefiore sustained her passion and principle into her seventies, only becoming less active when her sight deteriorated.<br>
<br>Internationalism was also important to Dora Montefiore's politics. Attendance at international suffrage and socialist congresses led to strong links with other activist women, as did her travels throughout the United States, Australia, and South Africa from 1910 to 1912. While in Australia in 1911 she edited the <span class="italic">International Socialist Review of Australasia</span>.<br>
<br>Dora Montefiore's writing knitted together all her political activities. Although she published poetry and translated Maksim Gorky, she was pre-eminently a journalist and pamphleteer. She wrote a women's column in <span class="italic">New Age</span> (1902&#150;6) and in <span class="italic">Justice</span> (1909&#150;10). Her pamphlets were on women and socialism while <span class="italic">Our Fight to Save the Kiddies</span> (1913) described her activities in the Dublin lock-out, which had resulted in her arrest on kidnapping charges. She published an autobiography, <span class="italic">From a Victorian to a Modern</span>, in 1927. Although there were those who found her difficult, it was hard to deny Dora Montefiore's energy and commitment. There were unsubstantiated rumours of drug abuse and gossip about an &#145;inappropriate&#146; relationship with a married working-class man, George Belt.<br>
<br>Dora Montefiore died on 21 December 1933 at her home, Melbourne, Edwin Road, Clive Vale, Hastings, and was cremated at Golders Green, Middlesex. She was survived by her daughter, her son having died from the effects of mustard gas in 1921.<br>
