<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lee Boo</span>  (<em>c.</em>1764&#150;1784), <span class="occ">first visitor to Britain from Palau</span>, was the second son (possibly the adoptive son) of the <i>ibedul</i> or ruler of Palau (<i>fl</i>. 1764&#150;1791), whose name is unknown. On 9 August 1783 on her return journey from China, the East India Company's packet <i>Antelope</i> under Captain Henry Wilson was wrecked on a coral reef off the archipelago of Palau (in the western Caroline Islands, Micronesia). The crew landed on one of these islands, Ulong (called Oroolong by the visitors). Ulong itself was uninhabited, but the crew struck up good relations with the people of a neighbouring island, having Malay as a common tongue. The highest-ranking chief or <i>rupack</i> of the islanders bore the title <i>ibedul</i>: he was thus understood by the Britons to be a king named Abba Thulle. The Britons were allowed to remain on Ulong and to fell trees there to build a new vessel, and were fed by the islanders. In exchange for this hospitality the Britons, with their firearms, helped Abba Thulle's forces subdue rival islanders.<br>
<br>Relations between the Britons and the islanders became so cordial that, when the Britons departed in their new schooner <i>Oroolong</i>, Abba Thulle sent with them his son, Lee Boo, to learn and bring home the ways of the English. One of the crew, Madan Blanchard, chose to remain among the islanders. Lee Boo was seasick at first, but was well cared for by the ship's surgeon, John Sharp. He began to wear European clothes, at first as a practical protection against colder weather than he had ever known. He tied knots in his coconut fibre cord, a traditional aide-m&eacute;moire dubbed his &#145;journal&#146; by the sailors, to record events and sights he must tell his father, though the cord was eventually overwhelmed by the very many new things he witnessed. After eighteen days the <i>Oroolong</i> reached Macau and was sold there by Wilson, who proceeded to Canton (Guangzhou), whence he sailed with Lee Boo for England aboard the company's Indiaman, <i>Morse</i>, arriving at Portsmouth on 14 July 1784. Lee Boo was taken to Wilson's home at 28 Paradise Row, Rotherhithe, London, where he lived for his entire time in England.<br>
<br>Wilson's promise to Abba Thulle to treat Lee Boo as his son, combined with his desire to avoid crowded places where disease might lurk, meant that Lee Boo led a quiet, middle-class life, not reaching the higher circles to which Omai and some later visitors were introduced. He lived for all of his five months and thirteen days in England with &#145;Captain&#146; and &#145;Mother&#146; Wilson, as he called them, becoming fast friends with their son Henry (Harry) who had been with his father on the <i>Antelope</i>, and attending an academy in Rotherhithe (perhaps the Peter Hills school).<br>
<br>In mid-December 1784 it was discovered that Lee Boo had smallpox; a range of treatments having failed, he died at 28 Paradise Row, Rotherhithe, on 27 December 1784. On 29 December he was buried in St Mary's churchyard, Rotherhithe, in Captain Wilson's family grave. The East India Company raised the present stone to his memory, with an epitaph by Brook Watson.<br>
<br>Lee Boo became exceptionally well known through George Keate's <span class="italic">Account of the Pelew Islands</span> (1788) which gave details of the islanders and of Lee Boo's experiences in England. The <span class="italic">Account</span> was based on Keate's meeting with Lee Boo in London, and on meticulously gathered information from the <i>Antelope</i>'s officers and especially from Henry Wilson's log (BL OIOC, L/Mar/B/570A). It is complemented by the first chart of Palau, by Wilson, and by engravings after drawings by sailors on board <i>Antelope</i>, notably the portraitist Arthur William Devis who was draughtsman on the ship. It also contains the best image of Lee Boo&#151;a stipple engraving by Henry Kingsbury, after Georgiana Keate, daughter of George Keate. She had met Lee Boo, though the image was drawn some fifteen months after the meeting. The image portrays Lee Boo in European dress and hairstyle with a gentle, enquiring expression. Many derivative accounts contained fanciful images of him in &#145;native garb&#146; (though Palauans wore only loincloths or grass skirts) and with facial features made more &#145;delicate&#146; and &#145;sensitive&#146;.<br>
<br>Keate ended his work with a reproach to the East India Company for having failed to tell Abba Thulle his son's fate. On 23 August 1790 John McCluer was sent to Palau in <i>Panther</i>. Reaching the islands on 21 January 1791, he broke the news to Abba Thulle of his son's death, also using the opportunity to establish what was intended to be a trading post on the islands. McCluer learnt that Madan Blanchard had also died, in uncertain circumstances. When he left he took with him three islanders, leaving two Britons behind.<br>
<br>McCluer's account, published by Henry Wilson's son-in-law John Pearce Hockin, completed the facts of Lee Boo's life (though it opened up the possibility that Lee Boo was Abba Thulle's adoptive rather than natural son), but by no means brought to an end his fame. Keate had been a friend and correspondent of Voltaire and was greatly influenced by the ideal of the noble savage. His <span class="italic">Account</span> had the aim of &#145;vindicating their [the Palauans' and similar islanders'] injured characters from the imputation of those savage manners which ignorance alone had ascribed to them&#146;  (p. xiii). Lee Boo and the other islanders, at once good hearted and sensitive, were proof &#145;that <i>natural</i> good manners is the <i>natural</i> result of <i>natural</i> good sense&#146;  (349, original italics). The <span class="italic">Account</span> emphasized Lee Boo's innate discrimination (he relieved the deserving poor, but exhorted sturdy beggars to work); his unstudied preference for useful knowledge (he disdained frivolous amusements, including Lunardi's balloon ascent which he was taken to see, in favour of gathering useful information and things such as seeds to take home); and his natural reverence for religious practices. It eulogized the islanders' society, claiming that its harmony rested on the lack of private property, as well as the benevolence of the king. Although a distinctly less rosy account of the king and the society had been published in a letter to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (54, 1784, 980&#150;81) from one of those on board the <i>Antelope</i>, it was Keate's <span class="italic">Account</span> that captured the imagination, going to five editions, being translated into French (1793) and German (1800), and inspiring and forming the basis for numerous subsequent retellings. The <span class="italic">Account</span> prompted William Lisle Bowles to include in the 1794 edition of his sonnets &#145;Abba Thule&#146;, a dramatic monologue describing the sorrow of the father waiting for news of his son: this poem was known to have been read by Samuel Taylor Coleridge who later in the same year included the lines, &#145;My soul amid the pensive twilight gloom / Mourn'd with the breeze, O LEE BOO! O'er thy tomb&#146; in &#145;To a Young Lady with a Poem on the French Revolution Sept 1794&#146;, which was inscribed in a presentation copy of <span class="italic">The Fall of Robespierre</span>. Coleridge's meditation on the lost innocence of his own childhood leads to a reflection on Lee Boo, whose death epitomizes the fate of innocence when it comes into contact with a corrupt society. Two years later Joseph Cottle published a long melodramatic poem entitled &#145;Lee Boo&#146; in the second edition of his <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1796). In 1789 <span class="italic">The Interesting and Affecting History of Prince Lee Boo</span> was published, so that &#145;children in Great Britain, Ireland, and America&#146; might learn from his example; it had eleven subsequent editions, the last in 1832. Children could reconstruct his life story in jigsaw puzzles by James Izzard (1818) and William Darton (1822, NL Aus.). In 1831 the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge issued a <span class="italic">History of Lee Boo</span>. This and the children's histories and jigsaw laid particular emphasis on edifying incidents from Keate, especially Lee Boo's instinctive aversion to strong drink, his natural modesty in adopting clothes, and his role as peacemaker as he unites Captain and Harry Wilson after a quarrel, though evangelical opinion later hardened against such idealizations of the non-Christian noble savage. Lee Boo inspired two plays performed in London in 1833; and a slight essay by E. M. Forster (1931) which compared Lee Boo's and Madan Blanchard's fates. He also inspired the anonymous <span class="italic">Adventures of Madiboo</span> (1809) and LaRoque Dubose's <span class="italic">Aye, Aye, Sir!</span> (New York, 1958). A full-length biography by Daniel J. Peacock (1987) rests largely on Keate's account but has useful extra detail.<br>
<br>Lee Boo was also remembered by Devis's Palau landscapes and portraits exhibited at the Royal Academy and the British Institution between 1796 and 1807. An eighteenth-century ship was named after him (<i>Prince Lee Boo</i>), as was an imaginary one (<i>Prince Leboa</i>) in Rudyard Kipling's <span class="italic">Captains Courageous</span> (1897). Comparisons between Lee Boo and exotic and inspiring non-Europeans were made from an early date: the review of Keate's <span class="italic">Account</span> in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (58, 1788, 629&#150;31) judges him to have made better use in his short stay of his &#145;natural talents&#146; than Omai did in a longer visit, and in their <span class="italic">History of Lee Boo to which is added the Life of Paul Cuffee, a Man of Colour, also Some Account of John Sackouse, the Esquimaux</span> (1819) the Society for Promoting the United and Scriptural Education of the Poor of Ireland proclaimed him one of three non-European moral exemplars.<br>
<br>In 1892 a plaque was placed in the north wall of St Mary's, Rotherhithe, by the East India Company to commemorate Lee Boo and the kindness of his father and fellow islanders to the wrecked Britons. In 1912 the part of Neptune Street closest to St Mary's Church was renamed Rupack Street, a memorial to Abba Thulle. A memorial to Lee Boo stands in Koror, the capital of Palau, which in 1983 issued commemorative postage stamps recording Lee Boo and Captain Wilson. In 1983 the London Museum of Mankind's &#145;Pattern of islands&#146; exhibition displayed artefacts from Palau brought back by Wilson and told Lee Boo's story. A room for children in the Museum in Docklands (Museum of London) is named after him, continuing his role as an example to the young.<br>
