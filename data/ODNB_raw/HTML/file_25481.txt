<span class="headword">Shuldham,  Molyneux</span>, Baron Shuldham  (1717/18?&#150;1798), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was the second son of the Revd Samuel Shuldham of Dublin and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Daniel Molyneux of Ballymurray, co. Longford. He entered the navy in 1732 as captain's servant in the <i>Cornwall</i>, with Captain George Forbes (later the earl of Granard). He afterwards served in the <i>Solebay</i> with Captain Charles Fanshawe, and for upwards of four years in the <i>Falkland</i> with Fitzroy Henry Lee. He passed his lieutenant's examination on 25 January 1739, being then described on his certificate as &#145;near twenty-two&#146;.<br>
<br>On 31 August 1739 Shuldham was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Tilbury</i>, one of the ships which went to the West Indies with Sir Chaloner Ogle, and in 1741 he took part in the unsuccessful attack on Cartagena. In 1742 he was the <i>Tilbury</i>'s first lieutenant when, on 21 September, she was set on fire in a drunken squabble between a marine and the purser's boy and burnt, with a large proportion of the ship's company. Shuldham, with the captain and other officers, was tried by court martial on 15 October, but was acquitted of all blame. As commander of the bomb-vessel <i>Blast</i>, Shuldham fought with considerable gallantry to prevent her, ultimately unsuccessfully, from being taken by two Spanish privateers in the West Indies (19 October 1745). In recognition of his efforts he was on 12 May 1746 promoted captain of the frigate <i>Sheerness</i>, then employed on the coast of Scotland  (BL, Add. MS 15956, fol. 191). In December 1748 he was appointed to the <i>Queenborough</i>, and in March 1749 to the <i>Unicorn</i>. In October 1754 he was appointed to the <i>Seaford</i>, from which, in March 1755, he was moved to the <i>Warwick</i> (60 guns), going to the West Indies, where, near Martinique on 11 March 1756, she fell in with a French 74-gun ship and two frigates, which overpowered and captured her. War had not then been declared, but hostilities had been going on for several months. Shuldham, with the crew of the <i>Warwick</i>, was sent to France, kept a prisoner at large at Poitiers for nearly two years, and returned to England in a cartel on 16 March 1758. A second court martial acquitted him of all blame for the loss of the ship.<br>
<br>On 25 July 1758 Shuldham was appointed to the <i>Panther</i>, in which he joined Commodore John Moore in the West Indies and took part in the reduction of Guadeloupe and its dependent islands from March to May 1759. In July he was moved by Moore into the <i>Raisonnable</i>, which was lost on a reef of rocks at Fort Royal off Martinique as she was standing in to engage a battery on 8 January 1762, when the island was attacked and reduced by Rear-Admiral George Rodney. In April Rodney appointed Shuldham to the <i>Marlborough</i>, from which a few days later he was moved by Sir George Pocock to the <i>Rochester</i>, and again by Rodney after a few weeks to the <i>Foudroyant</i>, in which he returned to England in 1763. In December 1766 he was appointed to the <i>Cornwall</i> guardship at Plymouth, and in November 1770 to the <i>Royal Oak</i>, then commissioned in readiness for the expected conflict with Spain. On 14 February 1772 he was appointed commodore, governor, and commander-in-chief on the Newfoundland station, which office he held for three years, and on 31 March 1775 he was promoted rear-admiral of the white.<br>
<br>Meanwhile in 1774 Shuldham was elected MP for Fowey, Cornwall, and became a loyal supporter of the North ministry. On 29 September 1775 he was appointed commander-in-chief on the coast of North America from the St Lawrence River to Cape Florida. He went to Boston with his flag in the <i>Chatham</i> (50 guns), arriving there on 30 December after a passage of sixty-one days. On 5 February 1776 he was promoted vice-admiral of the blue. His work was limited to covering the operations of the troops, and preventing the colonial trade, a task far beyond his resources. In June 1776 he was superseded by Lord Howe. Both Sandwich and the king sympathized with Shuldham and he was given an Irish peerage as Baron Shuldham (31 July 1776). That he was a brave and capable officer is well attested.<br>
<br>Early in 1777 Shuldham returned to England, and from 1778 to 1783 he was port-admiral at Plymouth. He was promoted admiral of the blue on 24 September 1787 and admiral of the white on 1 February 1793. On 4 October 1790 he married Margaret Irene, daughter of John Sarney of Somerset House, London, and widow of John Harcourt of Ankerwyke, Buckinghamshire; the couple had no children. He died at Lisbon in the autumn of 1798, whereupon the title became extinct. Shuldham's body was brought home from Lisbon in the same ship (the <i>Colossus</i>) as Sir William Hamilton's famous collection of Greek vases. The ship was wrecked in the Scillies and, though many of the vases were lost, Shuldham's body was recovered by heroic efforts.<br>
