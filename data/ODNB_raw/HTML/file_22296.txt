<span class="headword">Pingo family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1690&#150;1815), <span class="occ">clockmakers, engravers, and medallists</span>, was established in London in the 1670s. It is believed that the name Pingo or Pingoe&#151;as it was formerly, and occasionally, styled&#151;comes from Devon, where members of the Pyncowe, Pinchoe, and Pinkoe families were living between the 1480s and 1640s.<br>
<br>The first prominent member of the family was <a name="cosubject_40253"></a><span class="headword">John Pingo</span>  (1668&#150;1733)<span class="occ"></span>, the third son of John Pingo (<i>d</i>. 1677) and his wife, Elizabeth Pingo (<i>fl</i>. 1640&#150;1677), who was born on 11 January 1668 in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields. His elder brothers, Richard Pingo (<i>fl</i>. 1658&#150;1690) and Zachariah Pingo (<i>fl</i>. 1659&#150;1692), were both apprenticed in the Haberdashers' Company. Richard's name occurs on a late seventeenth-century bracket clock of fine quality bearing a Pall Mall, London, address. Zachariah is mentioned in a land tax assessment of 1692 as being in Plumbtree Court, the watchmaking area of the City of London, and was the grandfather and father of <a href="#cosubject_40254">Thomas Pingo senior</a> and <a href="#cosubject_22298">junior [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who were among the most prominent family members.<br>
<br>John Pingo entered an apprenticeship in the Clockmakers' Company in 1684. The register entry for his marriage in 1690 to Elizabeth Wells (<i>fl</i>. 1690&#150;1709) refers to his trade as watchmaker, as do the baptism registers for some of his children, none of whom appears to have distinguished him- or herself. These records also cite his residence and business premises in Gunpowder Alley, New Street&#151;a stone's throw from his brother Zachariah&#151;which were visited in 1710 by the German traveller Zacharias von Uffenbach. Uffenbach's journal vividly recalls John Pingo's diverse areas of interest, such as cleanly cast &#145;articles made in steel&#146;, a gilded seal of Oliver Cromwell, and an engraved plaque depicting Alexander the Great, of &#145;uncommon elegance and charm&#146;. Further references to &#145;marvelously elegant though very dear&#146; watchcases, and &#145;an especially curious water clock&#146;, suggest the quality as well as the diversity of his goods and skills  (Mare and Quarrell, 97, 113&#150;14).<br>
<br>Ester Marchant (<i>d</i>. in or after 1733), who was John Pingo's second wife, may have been related to the gem-engraver Nathaniel Marchant, whose uncle was John Marchant, an apprentice watchmaker and whose father may have been Nathaniel Marchant (<i>b</i>. 1702), also an apprentice watchmaker. John Pingo died in 1733 aged sixty-five and was buried at St Bride's, Fleet Street, on 22 April 1733.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_40254"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Pingo senior</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1706&#150;1743)<span class="occ"></span>, the son of Zachariah Pingo, was bound apprentice in the Merchant Taylors' Company in 1706. Having been made free of that company, he was himself master to at least seven apprentices in the 1720s and 1730s.<br>
<br>Thomas Pingo senior specialized in the engraving of heraldic devices on silver and copper plate. This work was rarely signed and it thus provides scant evidence of a specific engraver's hand. However, a single plate of armorials bearing Thomas senior's signature was published in 1715 in Ralph Thoresby's topography of Leeds, <span class="italic">Ducatus Leodiensis</span>. Thomas Pingo senior's name also appears in the household accounts of Henry, ninth earl of Pembroke, which itemize the engraving of silver plate between 1734 and 1743. He was also engaged in the more routine engraving of snuff-boxes, gun locks, and seals, which were frequently advertised as the stock-in-trade of jewellers and goldsmiths.<br>
<br>A rare mezzotint portrait of Thomas Pingo senior dated 1741 (BM) refers to him as an engraver, and points to the level of recognition that he had achieved in his profession. In 1711 he married Mary (<i>fl</i>. 1711&#150;1732); they had at least fourteen children, the most prominent of whom was Thomas Pingo junior. Thomas Pingo senior's date of death is not known.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22298"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Pingo junior</span>  (1714&#150;1776)<span class="occ"></span>, the first son of Thomas Pingo senior and his wife, Mary, was born on 24 September 1714 and baptized on 10 October 1714 in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields. In 1732 he was bound apprentice to his father in the Merchant Taylors' Company, but it was as a medallist that he achieved the greatest distinction, making the transition from the soft metal-engraving of silver and copper to the cutting of steel dies. With the technical skills necessary to manage the additional demands of actually striking medals, Thomas Pingo junior is believed to have been the first medallist in Britain to establish his own manufactory for this purpose.<br>
<br>Thomas Pingo junior was responsible for more than twenty-five of his own medals, struck between 1742 and the mid-1770s and usually signed &#145;PINGO&#146;, &#145;T. PINGO F.&#146;, or &#145;T. P. F.&#146; (F=<i>fecit</i>, or engraved). These include prize medals for the Board of Admiralty (1742), the Society of Arts (1758), and the Royal Academy of Arts (1770), as well as portrait medals of William, duke of Cumberland (1745), and George III (1759&#150;60). Examples of most of his work are in the British Museum. The designs for several Pingo medals were drafted by James &#145;Athenian&#146; Stuart, the painter and architect. Thomas Hollis, the whig antiquary and diarist, was frequently called upon to advise on suitable inscriptions for the medals, examples of which he would then purchase and distribute to friends and associates.<br>
<br>In 1756 Thomas Pingo junior received the appointment of engraver of punches at the assay office, Goldsmiths' Hall, cutting steel punches for the hallmarking of gold and silver plate. He also perfected machinery which gave the work greater precision. In 1771 he was appointed third engraver at the Royal Mint, and held the position until his death. Among the coinage with which he can be associated are guineas and half-guineas dated 1774&#150;86.<br>
<br>Between the 1730s and the 1760s Thomas Pingo junior's family and business were situated in Great Kirby Street, Hatton Garden. This was only a short distance from where his grandfather Zachariah Pingo and great-uncle John Pingo junior had been situated. Thereafter he moved a little north to Gray's Inn Lane, where the family stayed until the early 1790s. Throughout the 1760s and 1770s Thomas Pingo junior was a frequent exhibitor at societies in London, and among the work that he showed was a pattern thaler of Stanislaus Augustus of Poland in 1766 and a gold coinage trial for Brunswick-L&uuml;burg in 1767, as well as several of his medals. Thomas Pingo junior is frequently, but mistakenly, associated with the preparation of models for Josiah Wedgwood: a misleading attribution, arising from the simple misreading of the word &#145;medal&#146;&#151;for model&#151;on one of his invoices to Wedgwood.<br>
<br>In 1736 Thomas Pingo junior married Mary Goldwire (1714&#150;1790), and among their thirteen children John, Lewis, Henry, Benjamin, and Mary were to distinguish themselves. In 1769 the marriage took place between Eleanor, another daughter, and James Kirk, who may have been a member of the Kirk medal-engraving family. Thomas Pingo junior died on 1 December 1776 aged sixty-two. He was buried at St Peter ad Vincula, in the precincts of the Tower of London, on 7 December 1776.<br>
<br>Thomas Pingo junior's will, prepared in 1772, left much of the estate to his wife, Mary, including the house and the profits arising from the use of his medal dies. His sons John and <a href="#cosubject_22297">Lewis Pingo [<i>see below</i>]</a> were left his medal-making tools and equipment, and it is clear from the terms of the will that their father hoped and expected that they would succeed him at the mint and at the assay office.<br>
<br>Thomas Pingo junior gained a sizeable foothold in the London medal market, which continental medallists were trying to penetrate. His medals and those of his children represent the most enduring evidence of the Pingo family and their work. They are of a consistent technical and artistic standard, but only occasionally rise to levels of real excellence. The reliance on a relatively small repertoire of designs unashamedly reflects the ideas and taste of others&#151;most notably James &#145;Athenian&#146; Stuart and Thomas Hollis&#151;rather than any definite or particular style.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22296"></a><span class="headword">John Pingo</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1738, <em>d.</em> 1827)<span class="occ"></span> was the second son of Thomas Pingo junior and his wife, Mary; he was baptized on 11 March 1738 at St Andrew's, Holborn. John was apprenticed in the Merchant Taylors' Company to his father, whom he succeeded as engraver of punches at the assay office in 1776. John was awarded premiums by the Society of Arts for medal work, which included cutting dies and making puncheons. Among his medals&#151;none of which is signed&#151;are those celebrating naval and military actions in 1758 at Louisburg and Plassy. John also engraved seals, many of which he exhibited at the Society of Arts, in Spring Gardens, between 1770 and 1774.<br>
<br>In 1780 John entered the mint as third engraver, while still retaining his position at the assay office. In 1792, two years after the death of his mother, a two-day auction of the contents of the family house in Gray's Inn Lane was held. This included machinery and tools for medal production, which represent the residue of his father's, Thomas Pingo junior's, effects. John Pingo appears to have remained a bachelor, and in 1793 went to live at the mint in one of the houses allocated for engravers. He was superannuated from the mint in 1811 and retired from the assay office in 1815. He subsequently moved to Thornton Row, Greenwich, Kent, and died there in 1827, aged eighty-nine.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22297"></a><span class="headword">Lewis Pingo</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1743, <em>d.</em> 1830)<span class="occ"></span>, the fourth son of Thomas Pingo junior and his wife, Mary, was baptized on 26 July 1743 at St Andrew's, Holborn. He received instructions as a young student at William Shipley's drawing school, where he is said to have &#145;manifested great promise&#146;  (Farington, III/27).<br>
<br>Lewis Pingo was considered &#145;a worthy, promising young artist&#146; by Thomas Hollis  (Hollis, 21 Sept 1768), and he received premiums from the Society of Arts between 1756 and 1771. They were awarded for medal-making, gem-engraving, wax modelling, and drawing, examples of which were exhibited in London between 1761 and 1782.<br>
<br>Lewis Pingo's greatest legacy is his medals, which are variously signed &#145;L. PINGO&#146;, &#145;L. P.&#146;, or &#145;L. P. F.&#146; (F=<i>fecit</i>). They number more than fifteen, and include portrait medals of David Garrick (1772) and Captain James Cook (1783), as well as prize medals for the Royal Humane Society (1776) and the Board of Admiralty (1796). Examples of his work are represented in the British Museum.<br>
<br>Lewis Pingo succeeded to the position of third engraver at the mint on his father's death in 1776, and in 1780 was appointed chief engraver. He was responsible for coinage work, including the preparation of designs and wax models, the engraving of dies, and the production of tools to facilitate striking. Among the coinage with which he can be associated are patterns dated 1782, proposed as a measure against counterfeiting, the distinctive 1787 shillings and sixpences, and coinage for the Bank of England and the Bank of Ireland.<br>
<br>Lewis Pingo and his brother John began to trade under their joint names around the time of their father's death in 1776, by whom they had been bequeathed medal dies, collars, puncheons, and presses. A trade label (BM) refers to &#145;J &amp; L Pingo, Engravers to His Majesty&#146; and an address at 101 Gray's Inn Lane; they continued to produce medals until the mid-1790s.<br>
<br>Lewis Pingo had two wives, Sarah and Sally&#151;the marriage dates are not known&#151;with whom he had eight daughters. He retired from the mint as chief engraver in 1815, and subsequently moved to Grove Lane, Camberwell, Surrey. He died there on 26 August 1830, aged eighty-seven.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_40256"></a><span class="headword">Mary Pingo</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1741, <em>d.</em> 1819)<span class="occ"></span>, the first daughter of Thomas Pingo junior and his wife, Mary, was baptized on 18 October 1741 at St Andrew's, Holborn. Mary was awarded several premiums by the Society of Arts between 1758 and 1762 for floral and ornamental designs and drawings. Mary died a spinster, aged seventy-eight, and was buried at St Peter ad Vincula, Tower of London, on 26 March 1819.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_40255"></a><span class="headword">Henry Pingo</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1740)<span class="occ"></span>, the third son of Thomas Pingo junior and his wife, Mary, was baptized on 17 August 1740 at St Andrew's, Holborn. Henry was awarded premiums by the Society of Arts between 1756 and 1761 for fancy drawings and ornamental designs in oils and watercolours, exhibiting a group in 1773 at the Society of Artists in London.<br>
<br>Henry subsequently became a surgeon working in Shoreditch. By a remarkable coincidence&#151;and only six years after its inception&#151;he was one of the first recipients of his brother Lewis's Royal Humane Society medal, having saved a woman's life in 1782. It is not known whether he married or had children, nor is it known when he died.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22295"></a><span class="headword">Benjamin Pingo</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1749, <em>d.</em> 1794)<span class="occ"></span>, the fifth son of Thomas Pingo junior and his wife, Mary, was baptized on 8 July 1749 at St Andrew's, Holborn. In the late 1760s he was awarded premiums by the Society of Arts for ornamental drawings. He subsequently served as an officer of customs in 1772&#150;4, but achieved greatest prominence as a herald at the College of Arms, where his work included the preparation of family genealogies.<br>
<br>Benjamin Pingo was appointed rouge-dragon pursuivant in 1780, was granted arms in 1782, and became York herald in 1786. He officiated at the celebrations for the treaty of Paris in 1783, and his equestrian portrait appears on an engraving published for the occasion. Benjamin died with his fellow herald John Charles Brooke in a widely reported crush at the Haymarket Theatre on 3 February 1794, aged forty-five. His manuscripts were bequeathed to the College of Arms. He is thought not to have married.<br>
