<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Lodowick <span class="st"> [Ludovic]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>1573&#150;1607), <span class="occ">writer and courtier</span>, was the fifth son of Oliver Lloyd, lord of the manor of Marrington, and Gwenllian, daughter of Griffith ap Howel ab Ieuan Blayney of Gregynog. Nothing is known of his early life, but his works suggest that he was highly educated, being able to write in Latin and having a wide range of reference to numerous classical and biblical authorities. A number of Lloyd's early works are dedicated to Sir Christopher Hatton, including one of his most significant efforts, <span class="italic">The Pilgrimage of Princes</span> (1573), a long advice book for princes, which is prefaced by an elaborate acrostic poem to Hatton. It is possible that Hatton may have been Lloyd's patron and helped to launch his career at court. Lloyd refers to himself as an &#145;old servant&#146; of Hatton's in <span class="italic">The First Part of the Diall of Daies</span> (1590). Lloyd also refers to himself as &#145;her Maiesties Seargeant at arms&#146; in <span class="italic">The Stratagems of Jerusalem</span> (1602), and evidently kept this post after James I ascended the throne.<br>
<br>Lloyd appears to have been a notable figure at court. He was friendly with the printer and poet John Lane, who claims that Lloyd paid for the funeral expenses of Edmund Spenser, a story which seems unlikely and cannot be corroborated. He wrote an epitaph on Sir Edward Saunders in 1576, which was published as a broadsheet and included in a collection of poetry, <span class="italic">The Paradise of Dainty Devices</span> (1576). He wrote prefatory verses, as Lodowick Flood, for Humphrey Llwyd's <span class="italic">Breviary of Britain</span>, translated by Thomas Twyne (1573), and William Blandy's <span class="italic">The Castle, or, Picture of Pollicy</span> (1581), a work dedicated to Sir Philip Sidney. Edward Grant and Thomas Churchyard wrote prefatory verses to <span class="italic">The Pilgrimage of Princes</span>. Lloyd's works were all dedicated to Elizabeth, James, Prince Henry (<span class="italic">The Jublie of Britaine</span>, 1607), and Queen Anne (<span class="italic">The Choyce of Jewels</span>, 1607), or to prominent courtiers such as Sir Robert Cecil (<span class="italic">The Stratagems of Jerusalem</span>, 1602), and John Whitgift, archbishop of Canterbury (<span class="italic">The Consent of Time</span>, 1590). Whether this indicates Lloyd's success in gaining influence in the highest circles in the land, or simply a hopeful ambition, is unclear.<br>
<br>Most of Lloyd's works are collections of moralistic advice to princes, governors, and courtiers, relying heavily on classical and biblical examples (often the same ones). Lloyd exhibits a strongly protestant bias and warns of the dangers of Catholicism, notably in his poem, <span class="italic">Certaine Englishe Verses, Presented unto the Queenes most Excellent Maiestie, by a Courtier</span> (1586), written after the exposure of the Babington plot. The most substantial of his compositions are <span class="italic">The Pilgrimage of Princes</span> and <span class="italic">The Consent of Time</span>, a huge comparative history of the Jews, Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, French, Spanish, and other peoples, concluding with a history of the martyrs of the early church. Other of his works are clearly based on the substantial scholarship of these two books. Lloyd's output appears to have been erratic. After his first two works he published little until the early 1590s, and then nothing more until the early 1600s, culminating in five works published in 1607. This may indicate a busy career or other duties at court apart from his writing.<br>
<br>A stationer, also called Lodowick Lloyd, kept a shop in Pope's Head Alley, Lombard Street, London, possibly a son or relative of the above. With Henry Crips he published the first London edition of Robert Burton's <span class="italic">Anatomy of Melancholy</span> (1652) and, after moving to the Castle in Cornhill, published Matthew Stevenson's <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1665).<br>
