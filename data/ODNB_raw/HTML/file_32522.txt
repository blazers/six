<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Comper, Sir  (John) Ninian</span>  (1864&#150;1960), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 10 June 1864 at 44 Bonaccord Street, Aberdeen, the fourth child and first son of the seven children of the Revd John Comper (1823&#150;1903), rector of St John's Episcopal Church, and his wife, Ellen (1828&#150;1908), the eldest daughter of John Taylor, corn merchant of Hull, and his wife, Anne. Comper's parents were both English, and although he was by birth a Scot and never lost his love of the country his professional life was to be spent in London.<h2>
<a name="Backgroundeducationandearlycareer"></a>Background, education, and early career</h2>The Comper family had lived at Pulborough, in Sussex, since the Norman conquest and were yeoman farmers; the Revd John Comper's romantic belief that the family were Bretons, of Huguenot ancestry, has no substance in fact. Comper's father was a schoolmaster who had gone to Scotland in 1848 on the recommendation of Samuel Wilberforce, bishop of Oxford, to read for holy orders in the episcopal church. Influenced by the Tractarian movement, he became friends with Alexander Penrose Forbes, bishop of Brechin (who ordained him in 1852), the hymnologist John Mason Neale, and other leaders of the Anglo-Catholic revival. He went on to become rector of St Margaret's, Aberdeen, which became the most advanced church within the Scottish Episcopal church. Neale was one of Comper's godfathers and Anglo-Catholicism was the motivation and mainspring of his work as an architect; indeed, it was for this cause that most of it was executed.<br>
<br>In 1874 Comper went to Trinity College, Glenalmond, where he was brutally bullied. He left in 1880, and in 1882, after drawing for a term at the Ruskin School, Oxford, he became a voluntary assistant to C. E. Kempe, the glass painter and church craftsman, while continuing to draw at the South Kensington School of Art. He was taken to see Bodley and Garner's unfinished St Michael's, Camden Town (1876&#150;81), by Father George Congreve and he claimed that it was to the beauty of proportion and whiteness that he owed his conversion to architecture. In 1883 he was articled to G. F. Bodley, whom he was proud to call his master and whose work made a lasting impression on him.<br>
<br>In their mature work Bodley and Garner designed in the Decorated Gothic style of the fourteenth century, bringing it to a point of refinement that was in some ways an advance on the original. Comper's early work, notably the vaulted chapel of St Nicholas added to his father's church, St Margaret's, Aberdeen (1888&#150;90), the chapel and extensions for the community of St Margaret, built on the Spital in Aberdeen (1891), and the conventual church of the Holy Name, Malvern Link, Worcestershire (1893), are fluent exercises in his masters' manner.<br>
<br>In 1888 Comper entered into partnership with William Bucknall, an improver in Bodley and Garner's drawing office who had been articled to E. R. Robson, architect to the Board of Education. The partnership was unequal but balanced: Bucknall was a pedestrian architect, but he was a good draughtsman and constructor, while Comper had the greater artistry, originality, and imagination but lacked constructional skills. He always needed assistants, and after the partnership had been dissolved in 1905, Comper was assisted by his nephew Arthur Bucknall, by Ernest Jago, formerly chief draughtsman to J. F. Bentley, by W. A. Forsyth, later by his eldest son, Sebastian, and finally by his great-nephew John Bucknall. On 6 August 1890 Comper married William Bucknall's sister Grace (1868/9&#150;1933) at an elaborate medievalist ceremony at St Barnabas, Pimlico; they had four sons and two daughters.<h2>
<a name="CompersPerpendicularGothic"></a>Comper's Perpendicular Gothic</h2>In preparation for his marriage ceremony Comper had studied medieval manuscripts in the British Museum. The illuminations demonstrated to him that the Gothic altars designed by Bodley and Garner, with their overpowering reredoses, were foreign to the essential simplicity of the medieval originals. It was from this time that Comper's work was informed by liturgical principles in which the altar became the determining feature and focus of church planning. But he always insisted that his work was not purely archaeological but was subordinate to a quest for beauty which, at this stage of his development, he found fully embodied in late Gothic art and architecture.<br>
<br>Comper increasingly came to derive inspiration from English Perpendicular architecture of the fifteenth century. The Perpendicular revival had been started by J. D. Sedding at St Clement, at Boscombe, Hampshire (1873&#150;93). Comper brought to the revival a purist's attention to historical accuracy, modelling his work on the Perpendicular churches of East Anglia, which he visited in 1894&#150;5. His late Gothic preferences were reinforced by studying Flemish primitive panel paintings, initially in the National Gallery, then on a visit to Belgium in 1894. To this was added a study of late Gothic religious art on the Rhine to Mainz in 1896, on a journey which took him to Nuremburg, Rothenburg, W&uuml;rzburg, and Xanten, and with which he combined an enthusiasm for Wagner in a season at Bayreuth.<br>
<br>The first fruits of Comper's research are found in an authentically designed Gothic altar with riddle posts and a hanging pyx for the chapel of St Matthew's clergy house, Westminster (1892), followed by another in the restoration of St Wilfrid's, Cantley, Yorkshire (1892&#150;4). It was in restorations that Comper's early work was most fully expressed: informed by medieval inventories, he changed stripped, barnlike shells into unified works of art, accomplished by furniture, embroidery, and textiles, base and precious metalwork, painted glass, and decoration. Most complete of all his reconstructions was the restoration of St Mary's, Egmanton, Nottinghamshire (1897), for the seventh duke of Newcastle.<br>
<br>Nineteenth-century churches were remodelled in the same way. Between 1890 and 1900 Comper's work in the lady chapel of Downside Abbey, Somerset (1896&#150;1910), in the crypt of St Mary Magdalene, Paddington (1895), and St Barnabas, Pimlico (1891&#150;1901), introduced an interpretation of English church art and liturgical worship based on scientific principles which had not been attempted since the days of A. W. N. Pugin and George Gilbert Scott the younger (both of whom in terms of authenticity Comper surpassed). Comper's work was intended to fulfil the rubrics of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> and apply them to the modern age. What appeared to some to be retrogressive antiquarianism was essentially a radical attempt to restore to the Church of England a continuity with the medieval past and reunite it with the historic Catholic faith. It was Comper's artistry and knowledge which made his experiments acceptable to the educated.<br>
<br>Comper's brilliance as a church furnisher was recognized from the beginning of his practice. The virtuosity of his restorations and furnishing schemes made many regard him more as a church craftsman than an architect and builder, yet his work was architecturally conceived. As a craftsman he was an innovator. From 1886 he became associated with the school of embroidery of the Sisters of Bethany, Clerkenwell, and under his direction the <i>or nu&eacute;</i> technique of embroidery was introduced, leading the school to produce the finest church embroidery in northern Europe. His textiles were dyed by Sir Thomas Wardle, of Leek, in Staffordshire, and effected a transformation of ecclesiastical colour. His experiments in painted glass employed glass of strong but delicate tone on white grounds decorated with yellow stain. He revived the medieval practice of making blue glass in clay, rather than iron, pots using sand and seaweed. The result of these experiments may be seen in the series of windows of abbots and kings in the north aisle of Westminster Abbey (1909&#150;61). From 1903 he signed his windows with a wild strawberry. Comper's ecclesiastical design was not influenced as strongly as Bodley's had been by the aesthetic movement; he declined, too, to follow the free expression of the arts and crafts movement and established an independent line of his own founded upon perfected late medieval precedent.<br>
<br>Comper designed only fifteen churches and his only major secular commission was the Welsh national war memorial, Cardiff (1924&#150;8). His early work came to fulfilment in St Cyprian's, Clarence Gate, St Marylebone (1902&#150;3). Here he built a developed version of the late medieval parish church; but the intention behind it was to build a quintessential Anglican church of the twentieth century. &#145;Its design&#146;, he wrote in a service paper for the consecration, &#145;neither seeks, nor avoids, originality; still less is its aim to reproduce any period of the past, but only to fulfil these and other needs which are ours today, and to do so in the most beautiful manner of all&#146;  (&#145;On the significance of the building&#146;, quoted in &#145;Further thoughts on the English altar, or, Practical considerations on the planning of a modern church&#146;, 1933, 32).<h2>
<a name="Compersmaturestyleunitybyinclusion"></a>Comper's mature style: unity by inclusion</h2>In 1900 Comper read George Gilbert Scott the younger's <span class="italic">An Essay on the History of English Church Architecture prior to the Separation of England from the Roman Obedience</span> (1881), which had a far-reaching influence on his work and thought. In that same year he visited Rome, and in 1905 he went on to visit Sicily and the Mediterranean; in 1906 he visited Greece. These journeys made a profound impression on him and encouraged him to develop an inclusive approach to architecture which synthetized many decorative and architectural styles. In particular it was the Sicilian amalgam of Gothic, Greek, and Saracenic discovered in the Palermitan mosaic churches that led to the evolution of his second period, which he described as &#145;unity by inclusion&#146;. He moved from seeing the late middle ages as a golden age in comparison with which other centuries were either immature or decadent to concluding that both the Christian centuries and their classical inheritance had a valid application to an understanding of tradition as a vital, rather than static, force. Comper had discovered the debt owed by Christian art to Greece, and through travel and an exploration of Platonist philosophy he came to believe that the highest expression of beauty can be achieved only by inclusion, not exclusion.<br>
<br>No other English church architect of the twentieth century endeavoured to penetrate so deeply to the core of Western civilization by studying the church art and architecture of Europe in order to find there spiritual values for his own time. Comper's conversion to primitive models did not open a new period of mimesis. His understanding of the Christian tradition was accretive and in his fresh and sparkling use of precedent he vitalized tradition and made it distinctive of an English style. The figure of the Pantokrator became a necessary iconographical constituent; but he translated it from a stern, bearded Christ into a Hellenistic, beardless representation inspired by the early Christian images of the Good Shepherd.<br>
<br>The first expression of the fusion of styles is in Comper's restoration of Wimborne St Giles, Dorset (1908&#150;10). It is indebted to the French Renaissance and has affinities with the English early seventeenth-century amalgam of classical and Gothic. This was followed by St Mary's, Rochdale, Lancashire (1908&#150;12), in which the debt to Greece is more evident and where Comper first designed a figure of the Pantokrator executed in shallow relief above the rood. The altar screen of Wymondham Abbey, Norfolk (1913&#150;33), is the most developed statement of his new synthesis in church furniture. It was in St Mary's, Wellingborough, Northamptonshire (1904&#150;31), that the theory of unity by inclusion was given fullest architectural application. Here he combined English Perpendicular Gothic on a continental scale, using a French plan, with a classical arcade and furniture and Spanish Plateresque <i>rejas</i> of black iron. The altar stands beneath a classical ciborium, and the church is planned around it. The Majestas hangs above the rood screen, suspended from a lierne vault with fan pendants. But the aesthetic success of St Mary's lies in an exquisite use of Mediterranean colour, burnished gilding, and hangings of rose-red silk contained within white walls combined with ochre-coloured Northamptonshire ironstone. It is, perhaps, the most beautiful church built in England in the twentieth century. John Betjeman considered Comper to be the most delicate colourist and daring church planner of his time. What Voysey and Baillie Scott had done for houses, he believed, Comper had achieved for churches and so secured a place among the moderns. Yet Comper was strongly opposed to modernism and claimed for St Mary's, Wellingborough, in a paper, &#145;Further thoughts on the English altar, or, Practical considerations on the planning of a modern church&#146; (1933), that &#145;Only to its contemporaries does it owe nothing&#146;  (p. 32).<br>
<br>A journey to Algeria in 1924 took Comper to see the ruined fifth-century church at T&eacute;bessa, which persuaded him of the suitability of Constantinian church planning for modern, centrally planned churches. As early as 1912 he had brought forward the high altar of the Grosvenor Chapel, Mayfair, and for the first time opened a direct visual relationship with the worshippers in the nave. He now repudiated the Gothic altar, insisting on a classical ciborium as a necessary part of the Christian altar; he also broke new ground at the conventual church of All Saints, London Colney, Hertfordshire (1924&#150;7), and then in St Philip's, Cosham, Portsmouth, Hampshire (1937), by designing from the altar outwards. Here he anticipated the planning of churches which was brought to fruition on the continent after the Second World War and applied universally since the Second Vatican Council (1962&#150;5).<br>
<br>Although few and infrequent, Comper's writings had great influence. He published three liturgical papers: &#145;Practical considerations of the Gothic or English altar and certain dependent ornaments&#146; (1893); &#145;The reasonableness of the ornaments rubric illustrated by a comparison of the German and English altars&#146; (1897); and &#145;Further thoughts on the English altar, or, Practical considerations on the planning of a modern church&#146; (1933). These were followed by his mature reflections published in <span class="italic">Of the Atmosphere of a Church</span> (1940) and <span class="italic">Of the Christian Altar and the Buildings which Contain it</span> (1950). His early papers underpinned the research of Percy Dearmer and his popularizing attempt to establish a medievalist English use for the Church of England, while his later compositions influenced the theory of radical bodies such as the New Churches Research Group. Comper was dismayed by the plagiarism of his early work by Dearmer's Warham Guild and the encouragement of this development by the Central Council for the Care of Churches under the secretary, F. C. Eeles. Comper had become the most influential Anglican church architect of his time. His foremost public commissions were the Warrior's Chapel in Westminster Abbey (1925&#150;31) and the parliamentary war memorial window in Westminster Hall (1952).<h2>
<a name="Characterandappearance"></a>Character and appearance</h2>In 1938 Comper met John Betjeman. They formed a firm friendship and from that time until his death Betjeman became his principal advocate. His work was represented through Betjeman's eyes, and it was in reaction that Nikolaus Pevsner adopted an antagonistic stance and consistently dismissed Comper's work in <span class="italic">The Buildings of England</span>, thereby inflicting lasting damage to his reputation. It was to Betjeman's advocacy that Comper owed his knighthood in 1950. But Betjeman could mock as well as admire, and there was an ambivalence in his regard. It was Comper's personal charm in old age as much as his work that attracted him and others whom Betjeman brought into his life. From youth he had been afflicted by an oversensitive disposition, the result of a sense of frustration combined with a perfectionist sensibility. He was tormented by artistic touchiness and could be a difficult and formidable antagonist with a teasing sense of humour. But in sympathetic company he relaxed: his cultivated manners and exquisitely modulated voice, coupled with his powers as a raconteur of <i>la fin de si&egrave;cle</i> (he had known Beardsley and his circle, Swinburne's sister Isabel, the aesthetic company of Bodley and his patrons, and had moved in the society of the Souls), enchanted a later generation. With his friend and patron Charles Lindley Wood, second Viscount Halifax, he shared a passionate desire for the reunion of the Church of England with the Roman Catholic church.<br>
<br>Comper was an aesthete, and he dressed with an understated elegance. In youth he had red hair; but it turned white in middle life and from 1905 he wore a well-trimmed goatee beard and exchanged rimless pince-nez for gold-rimmed spectacles. A portrait of Comper (which he himself disliked) was painted in 1921 by his cousin Beatrice Bright and hangs in the National Portrait Gallery. Although happily married, Comper disliked women and felt carefree and more confident in the company of men. He had a Greek appreciation for the youthful male form, and this was represented by an over-delicacy of expression in his figure work and painted glass. He held that the ideal of male beauty was embodied in the ballet dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, and the oriental colouring of Leon Bakst's costume designs for the Ballets Russes influenced his later textile designs.<h2>
<a name="Death"></a>Death</h2>From the start of his marriage in 1890 Comper lived in Norwood, Surrey, first at 5 Chapel Road, then from 1894 at 158 Knight's Hill and from 1905 at 5 Gipsy Road. After the dissolution of his partnership with William Bucknall his drawing office (which he insisted on calling his study) was moved from 35 Old Queen Street, Westminster, to 228 Knight's Hill, where it remained until 1946. In 1912 he finally moved to The Priory, Beulah Hill, a stuccoed late Georgian &#145;gothick&#146; house with an avenue, large garden, woodland, and a lake; here he lived until his death at the Hostel of God, Clapham Common, on 22 December 1960. His ashes were buried in the north aisle of Westminster Abbey beneath his windows of abbots and kings.<br>
