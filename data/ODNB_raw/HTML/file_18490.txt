<span class="headword">Meres <span class="st"> [Meeres]</span>,  John</span>  (1698&#150;1761?), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was born in London, the son of Thomas Meres, the disinherited son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18583/', "Sir Thomas Meres (bap. 1634, d. 1715)")</script>. On 9 February 1713 John Meres was apprenticed to William Stephens, a London printer, for seven years and while it remains uncertain when Meres formally entered the book trade, it was most likely his relative Hugh Meres who gave him a formal introduction to the profession. Hugh Meres was a director of Sun Fire Insurance and the printer of the <span class="italic">British Mercury</span> and, from 1721 onwards, the <span class="italic">Historical Register</span>. In October 1719 he commenced a new daily newspaper, the <span class="italic">Daily Post</span>, and three years later was printer of the <span class="italic">British Journal</span>, before he died on 19 April 1723. His widow, Cassandra, the daughter of Thomas Grover the typefounder, continued the printing business until her own death in February 1726, at which time her son-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73737/', "Richard Nutt")</script>, assumed control. In December 1727 Nutt started the <span class="italic">London Evening-Post</span>, which by 1737 was under the printing management of John Meres.<br>
<br>By this time, Meres was established in the Old Bailey. He had married Sarah Robinson on 2 June 1732 at St Botolph without Bishopsgate; they had one son, John. The <span class="italic">Daily Post</span>, alongside the <span class="italic">London Evening-Post</span> and the weekly <span class="italic">Universal Spectator</span>, became the focus of Meres's energies, and he dropped the <span class="italic">Historical Register</span> to concentrate on the management of these three papers. With three newspapers printed from the same office, there were clear indications of reproducing news from each other, which was typical of the London papers of the time. While the <span class="italic">Universal Spectator</span> claimed that &#145;this Journal &hellip; contains about six Times more Domestick News than the Common Journals; with several material Paragraphs of fresh News, not in any other Paper&#146;, Meres was not loath to admit that in every issue of the <span class="italic">London Evening-Post</span> &#145;we copy the principal Paragraphs from the Morning Papers (without which our Evening Paper would be of no service to the Country)&#146;  (Harris, 161). Despite this process of news sharing, Meres's papers still offered enough space for competing commentaries. Indeed, in 1738 he was tried for inserting disparaging remarks in the <span class="italic">Daily Post</span> concerning the king of Sweden. Initially, he refused to find sureties for his good behaviour and was confined to Newgate prison, but he eventually changed his mind and Robert Gosling and George Strahan, both booksellers, offered sureties in his favour. However, within two years remarks in the <span class="italic">Daily Post</span> reflecting upon an act of parliament dealing with the embargo of provisions saw Meres called to the bar of the House of Commons on 2 December 1740, and he was subsequently held in gaol until 10 February 1741. Upon his release, Meres was cautioned for selling the <span class="italic">London Evening-Post</span>. Meres was also implicated in the legal action taken against Nutt in 1754 over the publishing of an allegedly seditious letter in the <span class="italic">London Evening-Post</span>, which led to Nutt's conviction and imprisonment the following year. Meres reputedly died in 1761, but no record of his death or burial has been located. The records of the Stationers' Company detail apprentices bound to and freed by Meres after 1761 though this may be the result of confusing Meres with his son, who was freed by patrimony in 1758. The son inherited the business and discontinued publication of the <span class="italic">Daily Post</span> in 1772.<br>
<br>Further confusion is caused by John Nichols identifying <a name="cosubject_18490"></a><span class="headword">William Mears</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1686, <em>d.</em> 1739) as John Meres, although there is no clear relationship between the two men. William Mears, <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was baptized on 24 October 1686 at Faversham, Kent, the son of Leonard Meeres, mariner, and his wife, Elizabeth. He was bound to the bookseller Israel Harrison on 9 September 1700 and on 6 October 1707, he was made free of the Stationers' Company. On 2 May 1709 he married Mary, daughter of the prominent bookseller and member of the Stationers' Company Daniel Browne, in St Dunstan-in-the-West parish. Between 1713 and 1727, he traded from an office at the Lamb without Temple Bar before moving to Ludgate Hill. He was master to several apprentices, including his son, William, who was bound on 6 June 1727. In 1713 he issued a catalogue of English plays and the following year he co-published, with his father-in-law, <span class="italic">The Persian and Turkish Tales</span> translated from P&eacute;tis de la Croix. He published no fewer than eight more works during the course of his career, including Defoe's <span class="italic">New Voyage Round the World</span> (1725) and <span class="italic">Tour through Great Britain</span> (1724&#150;7), before his death in 1739 from an unknown cause.<br>
