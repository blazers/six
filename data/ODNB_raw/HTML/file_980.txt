<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bache,  Samuel</span>  (1804&#150;1876), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister</span>, was born on 24 December 1804 at Bridgnorth, Shropshire, to Joshua Tilt Bache, a grocer (<i>d</i>. 1837), and his wife, Margaret Silvester, of Newport, Shropshire. After his mother's death in 1808 he was raised by his father's sister, Mrs Maurice, at Stourbridge. He was educated by a Mr Beasley, of Nodland near Stourbridge, a cousin of the well-known Revd Ebenezer Beasley (1763&#150;1824), dissenting minister at Uxbridge, and was for a time assistant in the school of the Revd Lant Carpenter (1780&#150;1840) at Bristol. He was educated for the ministry at Manchester College, York, in 1826&#150;9.<br>
<br>On 1 July 1829 Bache became minister at Dudley, and in 1832 moved to Birmingham as co-minister with John Kentish (1768&#150;1853) at the New Meeting, Moor Street, once the congregation of Joseph Priestley (1733&#150;1804); Kentish declined a salary after 1832 but continued to preach until 1844, after which Bache was in all but name sole pastor. During much of his pastorate, Bache also kept a school. In 1862 the chapel was sold to Roman Catholics, and the congregation moved to a handsome Gothic structure in Broad Street, called the church of the Messiah. In 1859 Bache took a leading part with the Revd John Cale Miller (1814&#150;1880), the evangelical rector of St Martin's, in the establishment of Hospital Sunday, an institution begun in Birmingham.<br>
<br>Bache regularly attended the New Street Theatre in Birmingham; the only other minister to do so was the high-church clergyman at St Paul's. Shortly after his settlement Bache publicly defended theatre-going against evangelical denunciation, an action that brought him a gift of a case of port from an anonymous admirer. In 1840 he similarly defended the triennial music festivals against the criticism of the Quaker Joseph Sturge.<br>
<br>On his settlement in Birmingham in 1832 Bache married Emily (<i>d</i>. 1855), the second daughter of the Revd Edward Higginson (1781&#150;1832) of Derby, whose eldest daughter, Helen, was the wife of the Revd James Martineau (1805&#150;1900). Seven children were born, three of whom became prominent in the English musical world: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/979/', "Francis Edward Bache (1833&#150;1858)")</script>, composer; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54667/', "Walter Bache (1842&#150;1888)")</script>, pianist; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55730/', "Constance Bache (1846&#150;1903)")</script>, musician and translator [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54667/', "Bache, Walter")</script>]. The youngest son, John Kentish Bache (1844&#150;1916), became Unitarian minister at Moretonhampstead in 1868, and took Anglican orders, after his father's death, in 1876.<br>
<br>With a commanding, reserved presence, Bache was a compelling preacher and a dedicated teacher. His friend the Revd John Gordon (1807&#150;1880) thought the very narrowness of his penetrating intellect was &#145;a condition of its exceptional power&#146;  (Gordon, 25). Among Unitarians Bache represented that section, deeply obligated to Priestley and aimed at carrying out the principles of John Locke's <span class="italic">Reasonableness of Christianity</span>, regarding Jesus Christ as the Messiah, the miraculously attested exponent of a pure morality and a simple theology, and the revealer, by his resurrection, of an eternal life; Bache's choice of the name for his new church in 1862 was thus a polemical statement at the height of a generational struggle within the denomination.<br>
<br>Such theologically conservative views had come under increasing attack from the &#145;new school&#146;, particularly identified with James Martineau and John James Tayler (1797&#150;1869). Their abandonment of the gospel miracles led Bache to propose on 23 May 1866 that the British and Foreign Unitarian Association require as a condition of membership &#145;recognition of the special divine mission and authority, as a religious teacher, of Jesus Christ&#146;. The motion, of which ample notice had been given, was severely attacked as an effort to impose a creed on a denomination that had steadily rejected human formularies, and its overwhelming defeat was widely hailed as a victory for religious liberty.<br>
<br>It was also a serious blow to Bache. His wife's death in 1855 had affected him deeply, and in 1868 failing health led him to resign his pulpit. Afflicted with &#145;softening of the brain&#146;, he lived the last two years of his life in a physician's house, Barnwood, in Gloucester, where he died on 7 January 1876. He was buried in Hockley cemetery on 13 January.<br>
