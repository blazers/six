<span class="headword">Holland,  Thomas</span>, fifth earl of Kent  (1350&#150;1397), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13543/', "Thomas Holland, earl of Kent (c.1315&#150;1360)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14823/', "Joan (c.1328&#150;1385)")</script>, daughter of Edmund of Woodstock, earl of Kent. After an early career soldiering abroad Holland became one of the less spectacular props of Richard II's regime, established mainly on the south coast, in and around Hampshire. He had a younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13529/', "John Holland, earl of Huntingdon (c.1352&#150;1400)")</script>, and two sisters, Maud (<i>d</i>. 1392), wife to Hugh Courtenay and then Waleran, count of St Pol, and Joan (<i>d</i>. 1384), wife to John de Montfort, duke of Brittany. Perhaps most significantly, the second marriage in 1361 of his mother, Joan, to Edward, the Black Prince, meant that Holland had a younger half-brother, the future king <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23499/', "Richard II")</script>.<br>
<br>Thomas Holland's early career from 1366 was spent in military service abroad, first in Spain and then in France. He was knighted by his stepfather and godfather, the Black Prince, at Vitoria in Castile in 1367, and was made a knight of the Garter in 1376. His power and influence was restricted by the fact that his mother, Joan, held the estates of the Kent inheritance in her own right until her death in 1385. To help offset this somewhat, Thomas was married <i>c</i>.1364 to Alice (<i>c</i>.1350&#150;1416), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9534/', "Richard (II) Fitzalan")</script>, the wealthy earl of Arundel; Alice's dowry was 4000 marks, and the Black Prince enfeoffed the couple with lands worth 500 marks in three Yorkshire manors.<br>
<br>Richard II's accession in 1377 meant that Holland's half-brother was now king. To reflect this, he received a gift of 100 marks and an exchequer annuity of &pound;200 in 1378, later augmented to 1000 marks in rents. He was also given custody of the royal forests south of the Trent in July 1377, and was appointed marshal of England in March 1380. The south was becoming his base: he resided much at Talworth Manor in Surrey (given him by his mother in October 1382); he became captain of Southampton in June 1380 to repel the French threat; and he served on the Surrey and Hampshire commissions of the peace. Late in 1380 he was accorded the title earl of Kent, which his father had held only briefly. His military experience was used to help suppress the peasants' revolt in Kent in 1381, and then as captain of the English bastion of Cherbourg from November 1384.<br>
<br>The death of his mother, Joan, in August 1385 brought to Holland the considerable estates of her inheritance. He was now a wealthy magnate, but played no great role in the political upheavals of 1386&#150;9, having lost the post of marshal in June 1385. He was made constable of the Tower of London in May 1387, but then rather faded from the court scene in the 1390s, increasingly preferring his Hampshire residences at Lyndhurst and Brockenhurst. He became constable first of Corfe Castle (with his wife) in May 1391, and then of Carisbrooke Castle in July 1396, and was appointed to the Wiltshire commission of the peace in December 1390. The focus of his inherited estates lay less in the south than in the north-east midlands, especially Lincolnshire, and it was from there he dispensed his grants and patronage, yet even in the south his influence was not dominant, with no obvious nexus of Holland supporters in local posts. Thomas Holland died on 25 April 1397. He was buried shortly afterwards in Bourne Abbey, Lincolnshire, following a funeral in Westminster Abbey. According to Adam Usk, after Holland's death one of the earl's greyhounds spontaneously made its way to the king, and accompanied him everywhere, until the moment in 1399 when Richard deserted his army in Wales, whereupon the dog abandoned the king and joined the duke of Lancaster.<br>
<br>Holland had nine children, whose marriages brought many magnate families into Richard II's royal kin: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13545/', "Thomas Holland, later earl of Kent and duke of Surrey")</script>; Richard (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1396); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13518/', "Edmund Holland, later earl of Kent")</script>; Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1405) who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19356/', "Roger (VII) Mortimer, earl of March")</script>, and then <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5163/', "Edward Charlton, Baron Charlton of Powys")</script>; Joan (<i>d</i>. 1434), who married first <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16023/', "Edmund, duke of York")</script>, second William, Baron Willoughby, third <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24959/', "Henry Scrope, Baron Scrope of Masham")</script>, and fourth Henry Bromflete, Baron Vessy; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98133/', "Margaret Holland")</script>, who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1861/', "John Beaufort, earl of Somerset")</script>, and then <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27198/', "Thomas, duke of Clarence")</script>; Eleanor (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1420), who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18999/', "Thomas Montagu, earl of Salisbury")</script>; Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1423), who married John, Baron Neville; and Bridget, a nun. Holland's widow, Alice, remained constable of Corfe Castle until 1407 and then retired to Beaulieu Abbey; she died on 17 March 1416.<br>
