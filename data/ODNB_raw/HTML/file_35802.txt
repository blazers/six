<span class="headword">Robinson, Sir  (William) Arthur</span>  (1874&#150;1950), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born at Long Marton, Westmorland, on 9 September 1874, the only son of William Robinson, tailor and draper, and his wife, Hannah Kidd. He was educated at Appleby grammar school and Queen's College, Oxford, where he obtained a first-class degree in both classical moderations (1893) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1895), and a second-class degree in modern history (1896). He was placed first in the civil service examination in 1897 and entered the Colonial Office, rising to the position of first-class clerk in 1907. He acted as assistant secretary to the imperial conferences of 1907 and 1911, and was secretary of the royal commission on the dominions, 1911&#150;12. On 24 October 1910 he married Jean Pasley Mitchell (<i>b</i>. 1884), the daughter of Robert Mitchell of North Kensington, London, with whom he had one son.<br>
<br>In 1912 Robinson became an assistant secretary at the office of works on the recommendation of Sir Lionel Earle, the permanent secretary, and after distinguished service in this post took his first position as permanent secretary at the new Air Ministry in January 1918. He was then moved to the key peacetime post of permanent secretary in the Ministry of Health in 1920 in succession to Sir Robert Morant, and remained there until 1935, establishing a reputation as one of the most prominent civil servants of his day.<br>
<br>The ministry was at the forefront of policies on a wide range of economic and social problems. There was major legislation on housing and slum clearance, public health, town and country planning, mental deficiency, old age pensions, and rating and valuation. In addition a key focus of the ministry's energies was the preparation and implementation of the 1929 <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span>. This abolished the poor law boards of guardians and transferred their services to the county and county borough councils. Outdoor relief was restyled public assistance, and the rest of the poor law was broken up and united with other local authority services. The act also introduced the first centrally determined exchequer block grant to local authorities to be distributed on the basis of a needs-related formula. The structure of local government, the orientation of modern British social policy, and centre&#150;local financial relations were recast in one legislative measure.<br>
<br>Priding himself to one of his private secretaries on having &#145;a first-class brain, the constitution of an ox, and some ideals but not too many&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), Robinson saw his role in these reforms as being to develop the general principles, leaving the detail to others. In this he was disinclined to be such a slave to work as his predecessor, Morant. In focusing on the big picture he was nevertheless viewed by one colleague as &#145;a mailed first beneath a velvet glove&#146;  (Ross, 22). In respect of the 1929 <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span> he countered Treasury arguments for a block grant irrespective of whether it was combined with other reforms, as well as those of his own senior health officials and richer local authorities who wanted the pre-1929 regime of expenditure-related grants to continue. Neville Chamberlain, the minister of health, found Robinson to be his crucial ally in negotiating reform through the policy process.<br>
<br>Robinson would have retired in 1935 but in deference to Chamberlain, then chancellor of the exchequer, he became chairman of the supply board. He oversaw the manufacture of goods for military service requirements and sought to achieve closer co-ordination for the different parts of the armed services. Robinson became the first permanent secretary of the Ministry of Supply in 1939, retiring in the following year. He was appointed CB (1915), CBE (1918), KCB (1919), GCB (1929), and GBE (1941).<br>
<br>To his colleagues Sir Arthur was a reserved and private man. During his working life he tended to be in London only during the week, disappearing back to the family cottage in Seaford, Sussex, at weekends. His manners were formal and his morals were Victorian. His one obvious passion was golf, for which he organized annual matches between Ministry of Health officials and senior local government officers. He lived quietly in retirement and died on 23 April 1950 at his home, Rodmell Hill Cottage, near Lewes, Sussex. His wife survived him.<br>
