<span class="headword">Lewis,  William Thomas</span>  (1746?&#150;1811), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born in Ormskirk, Lancashire. There is disagreement about the date, but 1746 is widely accepted. His grandfather was a clergyman in Wales, and his father, William Lewis (<i>d</i>. 1753), was a linen draper in London until he decided instead to form a travelling theatre company, which eventually crossed to Ireland. The young William made early appearances in his father's company, but started to achieve prominence only when, after education at the grammar school in Armagh and more experience as a strolling player, he arrived in Dublin and joined the company at the Smock Alley Theatre, where he made his first appearance on 3 June 1761. In 1767&#150;8 he performed at the Crow Street Theatre, and in 1771 he joined the company of his stepfather, William Dawson, at the Capel Street Theatre. There he made his first appearance as Belcour in Richard Cumberland's <span class="italic">The West Indian</span> (19 February 1771), in which part he &#145;vanquished Mossop&#146;  (Doran, 3.303&#150;4). Cumberland saw his performance and commended Lewis as &#145;the VERY <i>Belcour</i> he had an idea of when he wrote the piece&#146;  (Haslewood, 2.5). It was on Cumberland's recommendation that Lewis made a move to Covent Garden, and he played Belcour there for the first time on 15 October 1773. Lewis's later appearances in Ireland were not restricted to Dublin: it was in Cork, playing Othello to her Desdemona, that he met a young actress, <a href="#cosubject_64349">Henrietta Leeson [<i>see below</i>]</a>, whom he eventually married. Eight children (four daughters and four sons) were baptized, at St Martin-in-the-Fields and St Paul's, Covent Garden, between 1779 and 1789.<br>
<br>Lewis's later career was centred on Covent Garden, where he made almost all of his London appearances (<span class="italic">The London Stage</span> credits him with 799 between 15 October 1773 and 12 June 1800). Between his d&eacute;but and his retirement in 1808 he played some 194 parts and created at least 85 roles, including the original Faulkland in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>. Among his (and his public's) favourite parts was Copper Captain in <span class="italic">Rule a Wife and have a Wife</span>, by Beaumont and Fletcher, and it was in this role that he made his final appearance at Covent Garden. Haslewood wrote of him in this role (and as Mercutio): &#145;he is yet unrivalled; and it is doubtful whether he was ever excelled in those parts, which he represents in such perfection, that the most perfidious Critic cannot point out a single error or defect&#146;  (Haslewood, 2.6). Lewis's long career at Covent Garden was not solely as an actor: in 1782 he became deputy or acting manager of Covent Garden, and thereafter restricted most of the parts he played to comedy. Comedy seems to have been his forte. Haslewood obviously considered it so: &#145;<i>Pert</i> or <i>outr&eacute;</i> Comedy is his <i>chef d'oeuvre</i> &hellip; his proper sphere&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Nor were Lewis's appearances and activities limited to Covent Garden. In the early years he acted outside London, at Birmingham and Liverpool and for Tate Wilkinson's company at York, Leeds, Edinburgh, and Wakefield. Indeed, Wakefield appears to have been the only place where he did not attract an audience; on one occasion in 1780, on learning of the size of the house, he declined to appear. After giving up the management of Covent Garden (he sold his share to John Philip Kemble in 1803) he devoted much of his energy, with his colleague Thomas Knight, to the Liverpool theatre; their first season opened in November 1802. He also became involved with a theatre in neighbouring Manchester.<br>
<br>Lewis died at home at Westbourne Place, King's Road, Pimlico, London, on 13 January 1811, leaving his widow, two daughters, and three sons. He was buried at Christ Church, Liverpool. Two of the sons followed in their father's theatrical footsteps: Thomas became co-manager of the Liverpool theatre and Henry had a seemingly short and unsuccessful career as an actor. While Lewis was not as well known as some of his contemporaries, his unspectacular but steady career allowed him to leave a considerable fortune on his death. He was not recognized as a major figure of his age but is worthy of note, for he exemplifies not only the dominance of London through Covent Garden (and Drury Lane) but also important aspects of the theatre outside London&#151;especially of Dublin, where the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span> of 1737 did not apply&#151;the role of the touring companies such as those of Dawson and Wilkinson, and the growth of provincial theatres in the last half of the eighteenth and the early years of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>There is not a wealth of anecdote, as is the case with some of his contemporaries, to flesh out Lewis's life. His sobriquet Gentleman Lewis appears to have been well warranted: his farewell words to his audience at his final performance were that &#145;for the space of thirty years he had not once incurred their displeasure&#146;  (Russell, 209); and, of his management of Covent Garden, Haslewood commented: &#145;In this capacity it is, perhaps, impossible not to incur some dislike among the Performers, who regard his power with jealousy and envy; but his exertions for public entertainment have always been examined as they deserve, with approbation&#146;  (Haslewood, 2.6).<br>
<br>Lewis's wife, <a name="cosubject_64349"></a><span class="headword">Henrietta Amelia Leeson</span>  (1751&#150;1826), was born in London. Haslewood credits her with an early infatuation with the theatre, indulged by her father's inattention to his family and his business as a printer, and the encouragement of her friends. She was taken on by Charles Macklin as an apprentice and in 1771 went with him to Ireland, where she made her d&eacute;but at the Crow Street Theatre in Dublin. She accompanied Macklin to other towns, playing a number of roles, including Portia and Desdemona. After returning to Dublin she continued to act with Macklin until she obtained a release from her articles and joined the Dawson company at the Capel Street Theatre. She then lived with Lewis and in 1775 accompanied him to England, where they married about 1780. She also acted with the Covent Garden company, initially as Mrs Leeson, later as Mrs Lewis, and went with her husband on his visits to the provinces. Opinions differ about her abilities. Haslewood attributed her rare appearances on the stage (<span class="italic">The London Stage</span> lists 103 between 1775 and 1791) to her desire to provide for her large family rather than talent, although one critic said of her first appearance at Covent Garden that &#145;there was an ease and nature in her deportment and dialogue that entitles her to encouragement&#146;  (<span class="italic">Westminster Magazine</span>, November 1775) and Wilkinson described her as &#145;an amiable handsome woman, and a pleasing actress&#146;  (Wilkinson, 2.60). She died on 6 December 1826.<br>
