<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Beaton, Sir  Cecil Walter Hardy</span>  (1904&#150;1980), <span class="occ">photographer and designer for screen and theatre</span>, was born at 21 Langland Gardens, Hampstead, London, on 14 January 1904, the eldest of the two sons and two daughters of Ernest Walter Hardy Beaton (1867&#150;1936), timber merchant, and his wife, Esther 
    (Etty; 1872&#150;1962)
  , the daughter of Joseph Sisson, a blacksmith from Temple Sowerby, Westmorland. His first love was the theatre and a strong theatrical strain was evident in all his work. But early success came through photography, the love of which was inspired by a postcard of Lily Elsie (whose notice he contributed to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>), which he found on his mother's bed. He cajoled his sisters, Nancy and Baba, into becoming his first photographic models, designing their costumes and entering them into fancy dress competitions.<br>
<br>Beaton was educated at Heath Mount School, Hampstead, St Cyprian's School, Eastbourne, and at Harrow School. From there he went on to St John's College, Cambridge, ostensibly to read history and architecture. He did not graduate, however, and his main contribution was to the theatrical life of the university. He acted in and designed sets for the Amateur Dramatic Company (ADC) and Marlowe Society. In 1925 he came down without a degree, and, after spending six months &#145;doing very little apart from smoking Pera cigarettes and taking long hot baths&#146;  (Beaton, <span class="italic">Photobiography</span>, 38), spent some unhappy months working in the Holborn office of a friend of his father's. He knew that he had to escape from this life, which the author Truman Capote called &#145;a cocoon of middle-class&#146; respectability  (&#145;Beaton by Bailey&#146;, television documentary).<br>
<br>Beaton achieved this by his industry and imagination and the judicious use of publicity. He made a name for himself taking glamorous photographic portraits of the &#145;bright young things&#146; of the day, who soon thirsted for his talents. His use of soft focus was in emulation of an existing technique; it was the unusual props and painted (or reflective) backgrounds, which he executed himself, that were the distinguishing feature of his portrait photographs. His backdrops made creative use of new materials such as cellophane, as well as mirrors&#151;a good example of the latter was his portrait of Mountbatten. Later he would urge aspirant photographers to &#145;break every photographic rule &hellip; a technical &#147;failure&#148; which shows some attempt at aesthetic expression is of infinitely more value than an uninspired success&#146;  (Beaton, <span class="italic">Photobiography</span>, 183). He became a friend of the aesthete Stephen Tennant and others, notably Osbert and Edith Sitwell, and his rise to fame was meteoric. His ingenious photographic portraits of the Sitwells led to his employment with <span class="italic">Vogue</span> as photographer, caricaturist, and illustrator, first in London and later in New York. In 1927 and 1930 he held one-man exhibitions at the Cooling Gallery, Bond Street, for both of which Osbert Sitwell wrote the introduction. He produced his first book, <span class="italic">The Book of Beauty</span> (1930). By the end of the 1920s&#151;a decade which Beaton may be said to personify&#151;he had been granted sittings by all whom he had aspired to photograph, except Queen Mary and Virginia Woolf.<br>
<br>In the 1930s Beaton was exposed to influences such as Jean Cocteau and Christian B&eacute;rard, and his work became accordingly more baroque. He branched into the world of ballet and opera, designing revues for Charles Cochran&#151;<span class="italic">Streamline</span> (1934) and <span class="italic">Follow the Sun</span> (1936)&#151;while continuing to photograph in London, New York, and Hollywood. But he noted: &#145;Throughout my photographic career I have always felt that in five years' time I should no longer be a photographer&#146;  (Beaton, <span class="italic">Photobiography</span>, 184). In 1930 he forged a lifelong love of Wiltshire, renting Ashcombe, a derelict house in a glorious, Arcadian setting near Win Green. He converted Ashcombe into a jewel of a house, where he entertained friends such as Rex Whistler, Augustus John, and Edith Olivier, staged a <i>f&ecirc;te-champ&ecirc;tre</i>, and made films. He was desolate when the landlord refused to renew his lease in 1945.<br>
<br>In the 1930s Beaton had photographed some members of the royal family, notably the duchess of Gloucester, and in 1937 Mrs Wallis Simpson invited him to take the formal wedding photographs of her marriage to the duke of Windsor in France. Beaton's career was progressing well until he introduced some offensive antisemitic doodles into an illustration for American <span class="italic">Vogue</span> in February 1938. He denied being anti-Jewish, and declared himself to be &#145;violently hostile to Hitler&#146;  (Vickers, 1993 edn, 208). But Cond&eacute; Nast promptly dismissed him, and he did no work in the United States for a year and a half. The incident rose to haunt him periodically in later life.<br>
<br>Beaton's career was saved by two events. First, Queen Elizabeth invited him to photograph her at Buckingham Palace in July 1939. Beaton created glorious portrait photographs of her, playing an important role in the creation of her image as queen. Some of these pictures were released during the war as a morale-boosting contrast to the sinister images of Nazi Germany. Second, the war itself came to his aid, because he was able to make an important contribution as a war photographer. He depicted Churchill behind his desk in Downing Street, but more famous was his study of a bombed-out child in hospital, <span class="italic">Eileen Dunne in the Hospital for Sick Children</span> (1940). This picture was on the front cover of <span class="italic">Life</span> magazine in September 1940 and was said to have influenced American feeling concerning the war more than any other picture. Beaton travelled throughout England for the Ministry of Information and later to the Middle East, north Africa, and the Far East. By his courage and dedicated approach he earned the respect of the three services. Six books emerged from these years.<br>
<br>After the war, stage, film, ballet, and opera work gave Beaton more opportunities. In 1945 he designed the set for <span class="italic">Lady Windermere's Fan</span>, with an opulence of style that was a tonic for post-war Britain. The following year he took the part of Cecil Graham in the American production of the play. In 1948 he was responsible for the costumes for the films <span class="italic">An Ideal Husband</span> and <span class="italic">Anna Karenina</span> for Sir Alexander Korda. Other noted productions on which he worked were <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> (1949), <span class="italic">Quadrille</span>, for No&euml;l Coward (London, 1952; New York, 1954), <span class="italic">Turandot</span> (New York, 1961; London, 1963), and <span class="italic">La traviata</span> (New York, 1966). His greatest stage success was to design costumes for <span class="italic">My Fair Lady</span> in 1956; its memorable black and white Ascot scene invariably drew a gasp of delight when the curtain rose. He repeated this success when he spent a year in Hollywood in 1963 working on the film adaptation. For his costume design and art direction he won two Oscars. (He had been awarded his first Oscar in 1958 for the film <span class="italic">Gigi</span>, arguably a more stunning screen production.) His own play, <span class="italic">The Gainsborough Girls</span>, was staged at Brighton in 1951 and in a revised version in 1959. Unfortunately it floundered on both occasions.<br>
<br>Beaton also made a considerable contribution to the world of fashion. Perhaps his best book is his personal survey of fifty years of changing fashion, <span class="italic">The Glass of Fashion</span> (1954). He gave a collection of the dresses he most admired to the Victoria and Albert Museum, and many of them were exhibited there in 1971. He was a dedicated and perceptive diarist from 1922 to 1980; six volumes of his diary were published in his lifetime, along with a <span class="italic">Photobiography</span> (1951).<br>
<br>Beaton continued to photograph throughout his later years. He photographed all the queen's children as babies, and he was the official photographer at the coronation and at several royal weddings. He also explored what the artist Michael Wishart called &#145;the Peacock Revolution&#146;, photographing rising figures of the 1960s such as the Rolling Stones, Twiggy, Jean Shrimpton, and the cast of the satirical revue <span class="italic">Beyond the Fringe</span>. Shortly before his death he photographed Little Bo Bitch, one of the lesser lights of the punk rock scene.<br>
<br>In 1968 Beaton's career was crowned with an important exhibition of his photographs at the National Portrait Gallery, where many remain on deposit or on show. In 1950 he was awarded the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. He was created CBE in 1957 and knighted in 1972. Two years later he suffered a bad stroke, but he gradually learned to paint, write, and take photographs with his left hand. He died at his second Wiltshire home, Reddish House, Broadchalke, on 18 January 1980, and was buried on 23 January in the churchyard of All Saints, Broadchalke.<br>
<br>Beaton was a man of immense style and sartorial elegance, forever fascinated by new ideas and attitudes. He possessed an extraordinary visual sense and an eye which, in a flash, took in every minor detail around him; Capote once ventured that &#145;The camera will never be invented that could capture or encompass all that he actually sees&#146;  (Beaton, <span class="italic">The Best of Beaton</span>, 11). Beaton's conversation was witty and penetrating, and, while he enjoyed the company of glittering society, above all he valued and sought out talent and individuality. He suffered from the intermittent accusation that much of his work was light or trivial, but the wide range of his achievements and the pleasure that he gave the world makes this an unfair assessment.<br>
<br>Beaton was not granted much happiness in his personal relationships. During his younger years he was miserably and unrequitedly in love with the art connoisseur (Victor William) Peter Watson (1908&#150;1956). He was essentially homosexual but pursued a tormented relationship for several decades with the screen actress Greta Garbo; he proposed to her, but was refused, and he remained unmarried.<br>
<br>The many facets of Beaton's character and career are perhaps best caught in the <i>bon mots</i> of his friends. Capote once noted that he was &#145;a total self-creation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bailey on Beaton</span>, television documentary); revealingly, Beaton himself once wrote in his diary (9 October 1923): &#145;I don't want people to know me as I really am but as I'm trying and pretending to be&#146;  (Vickers, 1993 edn, xvii). In this aim he appears largely to have succeeded. The critic Kenneth Tynan recorded that he managed to give the impression, on arriving at a society party, of &#145;an actor who has just made a superb exit; you would think that he had just come from some garish and exhausting rout on the floor above&#146;  (ibid., xxvi); more tersely, Cyril Connolly called him &#145;Rip-Van-With-It&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, 13 March 1966). The playwright Alan Jay Lerner (1918&#150;1996) said, of his work in the theatre: &#145;He was the only designer whose sketches were stunningly beautiful and outrageously funny at the same time&#146;  (Vickers, 1993 edn, xxv). Capote rated him as &#145;one of the three or four best photographers in this century&#146;  (ibid., xxvii) and an abiding influence on the succeeding generation. Beaton himself was apt to consider his work ephemeral, but it is certain that his considerable output, both visual and written, amounts to a unique and enduring portrait of the age in which he lived.<br>
