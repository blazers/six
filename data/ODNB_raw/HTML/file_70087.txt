<span class="headword">Plaxton,  George</span>  (1647/8&#150;1720), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and antiquary</span>, was born in Wressel, Yorkshire, the son of William Plaxton and Beatrice, the daughter of Henry Akeroyd. Educated at Pocklington School, he was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, in March 1666 aged eighteen. After graduating BA he was ordained deacon on 29 May 1670. He was a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the Leveson-Gower family, who presented him to the living of Sheriffhales, Shropshire, in 1673 where on 29 September 1677 he married Alice Perratt. In the same year he became rector of Kinnardsey, Shropshire. He was presumably the author of <span class="italic">The Loyal Speech of G. Plaxtone upon the Proclamation of King James II</span> (1685). He resigned the parish of Sheriffhales on his presentation by Sir William Leveson-Gower as rector of Donington, Shropshire, on 10 July 1690.<br>
<br>Plaxton was a keen antiquary, as indicated by the notes he inserted into one of the Donington register books, and his name appears among the subscribers to various contemporary antiquarian works. He also participated in the growing interest in natural history, publishing &#145;Some natural observations made in the parishes of Kinnardsey and Donington&#146;  (<span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, 25, no. 310). He and Alice had four sons and three daughters between 1678 and 1690; their births are recorded in the parish register of Donington, although all but the youngest were born at Sheriffhales.<br>
<br>Plaxton resigned his Shropshire parishes on being presented by Lord Gower as rector of the valuable living of Barwick in Elmet, Yorkshire, on 16 July 1703. In contrast to his immediate predecessors, he resided at Barwick and maintained an active ministry, opening the church for weekday services and celebrating communion at least once a month. He appears to have made the acquaintance of the Yorkshire antiquary Ralph Thoresby almost immediately upon his appointment to Barwick; their surviving correspondence begins in September 1703. In Yorkshire Plaxton continued his interest in local history and exchanged documents with Thoresby. There is substantial evidence of his humorous nature: his letters to Thoresby reveal his tendency to apply nicknames to his acquaintances, while part of an amusing correspondence with a York watchmaker is preserved in the British Library  (Add. MSS 4275&#150;4276). He also wrote comic verse, of which the best-known is an electioneering squib, &#145;The Yorkshire Horse Racers&#146;.<br>
<br>Alice Plaxton died at some time before the death of Lord Gower in August 1709. In 1710 Plaxton appointed his son John, a graduate of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, curate of Barwick. He retired to the Leveson-Gower home at Trentham, where he served as steward to the Gower estates and acted as chaplain to his former patron's heir, John, a minor. From Trentham he wrote a letter in 1716 quoted in Boswell's <span class="italic">Life of Johnson</span> because of its mention of Johnson's father. He retained the living of Barwick until his death in October 1720 and was buried at Trentham parish church on 7 October.<br>
