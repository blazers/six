<span class="headword">Kurz,  (Wilhelm) Sulpiz</span>  (1834&#150;1878), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born on 5 May 1834 at Augsberg, Bavaria, the son of Aloys Kurz, an engineer. His father died in 1842 and he and his mother moved to Munich where he attended school. He then entered Munich University where he was a pupil of C. F. P. von Martius, the professor of botany and traveller in Brazil. In 1854, having quarrelled with his family, Kurz went to Delft in the Netherlands, where he worked as an apothecary. In 1856 he enlisted in the subordinate medical services of the Dutch East India army under the alias of Johann Amann. He arrived at Batavia in September 1856, and subsequently served at Banka and the Celebes, taking advantage of his travels to collect plants widely. On his return to Batavia in September 1859 he was appointed to assist at the botanical garden at Buitenzorg, a post which he occupied until 1863. In that year he was induced by Thomas Anderson, superintendent of the Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta, who was visiting the Dutch possessions, to return with him to Calcutta as curator of the herbarium. This appointment he held until his death.<br>
<br>Kurz became very familiar with both Indian and Malayan floras, and was frequently dispatched on botanical missions. In 1866 he spent three months on the Andaman Islands, the subject of a detailed report published in 1870. Two expeditions to Burma, in 1867&#150;8 and 1870&#150;71, prepared him for his most important work, his <span class="italic">Forest Flora of British Burma</span> (2 vols., 1877). In November 1877 Kurz went on leave, and proceeded on a tour to Burma and the Straits Settlements for the benefit of his health. He died at Pulo-Penang on 15 January 1878 of fever complicated by a thigh abscess. A monument in his memory was erected in the Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta.<br>
<br>Kurz published over sixty reports and papers, seventeen of which appeared in the <span class="italic">Journal</span> and <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, of which he was elected a member in 1869. Other papers were published principally in the <span class="italic">Journal of Botany, British and Foreign</span> (1866&#150;76) and <span class="italic">Flora</span> (1871&#150;5).<br>
