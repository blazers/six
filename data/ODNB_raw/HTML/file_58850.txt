<span class="headword">Sharp, Sir  Percival</span>  (1867&#150;1953), <span class="occ">schoolteacher and educational administrator</span>, was born on 12 September 1867, at Bishop Auckland, co. Durham, the son of Henry Sharp, a grocer, and his wife, Catherine. He attended Edward Walton's endowed (public elementary) school, Bishop Auckland, and at the age of thirteen was apprenticed as a pupil teacher. He moved on to Homerton College, Cambridge, where he was top student of his year. On 28 March 1891 he married Janet (<i>b</i>. 1867/8), daughter of Thomas Henderson McLaren, with whom he had three sons. As a certificated teacher he held posts in West Hartlepool, Croydon, and Hull where he taught at the central higher grade school. After a short period of headship in Hull, he became headmaster of Bowerham School, Lancaster's first board school.<br>
<br>In 1903 Sharp was appointed inspector of schools in St Helens and subsequently director of education and in 1914 moved to Newcastle in a similar capacity. In 1919 he was invited to become Sheffield's first director of education, a post which he held until 1932. He was first elected to the executive committee of the Association of Education Committees (AEC) in 1911, and, except for a two-year break, was an active member of the executive for the rest of his life. The Association of Education Committees was set up in 1904 to represent the interests of the newly created education committees to government, and both chairs of committees and directors of education were normally in membership of the association. In its early years most of the education committees in the boroughs and urban districts joined the association, but it was not until the late 1940s that county education committees came in. The reorganization of local government in 1974 led directly to the association's demise in 1977. Sharp was the honorary secretary of the association from 1925 to 1932, when he was appointed as the association's first full-time secretary, a position he held until the end of 1944.<br>
<br>Sharp's long life was devoted to the state education service, and particularly to enhancing the role of the local education authorities within it. After the passing of the 1902 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>, the Board of Education under Sir Robert Morant's leadership, tried to keep the newly created local education authorities (LEAs) firmly under its own control. Several of the directors of education in the large industrial cities resisted and were determined to raise the status of the chief officers of LEAs. Spurley Hey (Manchester), James Graham (Leeds), and Sharp, affectionately termed the Three Musketeers by contemporaries, took a leading part in this and by the end of the 1920s had largely succeeded in their objective. Later, board officials complained that in the 1920s the balance of power had passed to the LEAs and that the department's own position had been belittled  (Cooke and Gosden, 50).<br>
<br>For about twenty years Sharp was at the helm at the AEC, and was effectively the voice of the LEAs. He was the driving force behind the setting up of a national office in London, and he also conducted the negotiations which brought the journal, <span class="italic">Education</span>, under the association's control. He had a formidable reputation as an organizer, a forceful speaker, and writer, although some saw his manner as dictatorial. Lord Eustace Percy, a former president of the Board of Education, referred to him as the AEC's &#145;chief professional henchman&#146; who was &#145;a little combative bull-terrier of a man&#146;  (Percy, 122). His successor as secretary to the AEC, Bill Alexander, pointed out that &#145;he loved a fight and no one can deny he was a bonny fighter&#146;  (<span class="italic">Education</span>, 13 Feb 1953, 261). Sharp was also described as &#145;a pedagogic gnat on the loins of the minister of education&#146;  (<span class="italic">Education</span>, 24 Nov 1944, 643). In 1944 Sharp recalled &#145;the time when to approach the board of education was like laying a profane hand on the Ark of the Covenant&#146;, but took pride in the fact that &#145;now the association's advice was not only welcomed but sought&#146;  (ibid., 643). At times Sharp irritated the board's officials, acquiring a reputation for making public material they regarded as confidential, and he never enjoyed the same measure of confidence among them as Alexander did after the war.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Sharp took a strong interest in teachers' pay. In his early days as a teacher he negotiated with Croydon school board for a pay rise for his colleagues. He was involved with the Burnham committee from its inception in 1919, serving as secretary to the local authorities' panel on that body from 1925 to 1944. He helped to frame the original Burnham pay scales, and later expressed the view that the work of this committee &#145;had revolutionised the economic condition of vast numbers of teachers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Education</span>, 5 Jan 1945, 14). In 1949 he resigned in protest from Burnham when the committee was forced by government to reject a pay rise for teachers which he believed was merited.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Sharp was involved in the negotiations which led up to the 1944 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>. He had little option but to fight for the continued existence of part 3 education authorities which had been set up by the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1902 as authorities for elementary education in non-county boroughs with populations over 10,000 and in urban districts with populations over 20,000. The AEC stood to lose a large number of members if they were abolished. There was, by this time, widespread agreement that these authorities had outlived their usefulness and Sharp lost this battle. At this time, Sharp also served on the Norwood committee which reported to the Board of Education on the curriculum and examinations in secondary schools. The committee provided much of the rationale for the post-war tripartite system of secondary schooling. There is no evidence to suggest that Sharp played a leading role on the Norwood committee, and he was quite content to subscribe to the prevailing view that there should be differentiation between types of secondary schools. His main interest was to ensure that local education authorities retained control of the proposed new secondary modern schools which he tended to see as former senior elementary schools  (TNA: PRO, Ed. 136/378, note of meeting, 11 Aug 1943). He saw no reason why these schools, even if they were secondary in name, should be given the same kind of independence afforded to the grammar schools.<br>
<br>In 1938 Sharp was knighted for his services to education. From humble origins he came &#145;to the top the hard way&#146; and tended, at least in his later years, &#145;to look at education always rather from the extinct pupil-teacher point of view&#146;  (Percy, 122). He was invariably a forceful negotiator, and &#145;a tough nut&#146; which is well illustrated by the fact that he travelled from Falmouth to London for AEC executive meetings when he was in his eighties. He attended his last executive on 30 January and died at his home, Kinbrae, Gyllyngvase Road, Falmouth, Cornwall, on 8 February 1953.<br>
