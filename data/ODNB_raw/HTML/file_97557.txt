<span class="headword">Needham,  Rodney</span>  (1923&#150;2006), <span class="occ">anthropologist</span>, was born Rodney Needham Green on 15 May 1923 at The Limes, Belle Grove Road, Welling, Bexley, Kent, the only son and eldest of three children of Horace Edward Green, a clerk in the War Office (later an official in the Ministry of Supply), and his wife, Mary Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Needham. After a year of schooling at Haileybury College he enlisted in the Scots Guards in 1941. In 1942 he was posted to India, where he transferred to the 1st Gurkha rifles. He was commissioned second lieutenant that year, and promoted temporary captain in 1943. In 1944, just before the battle of Kohima, he was severely wounded in the leg while attempting to light a flame thrower; his subahdar, Narang Ghal, was awarded an MC for rescuing him under heavy enemy fire. Demobilized in 1947, he changed his name to Rodney Needham (a change confirmed by deed poll in February 1951), apparently because of disappointment that his father had not once written to him while or after he recovered from his battle injuries in Burma. In 1947 he enrolled at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London to learn Chinese, and on 10 April 1948 he married (Maud) Claudia Walch, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brysz (1919/20&#150;1989), a translator for the BBC. She was the former wife of Frederic Alfred Walch and daughter of Stanislaw Brysz, a university professor. They had two sons, Tristan and Guy.<br>
<br>After completing his studies at SOAS in 1949 Needham went to Merton College, Oxford, for graduate training in social anthropology. In 1951&#150;2 he carried out fieldwork among the nomadic Penan of Sarawak, Borneo, for which he received a doctorate. In 1954&#150;5 he conducted fieldwork on the Indonesian island of Sumba. In 1956 he was appointed lecturer in social anthropology at Oxford and later became a fellow of Merton College. In 1976 he was elected professor of social anthropology and made a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. He held numerous visiting fellowships and professorships in universities in the USA, Australia, and Japan.<br>
<br>Needham's reputation rested primarily on his early championing of L&eacute;vi-Strauss's version of structuralism, which, together with Edmund Leach and Mary Douglas, he brought across the channel, Anglicizing it in the process. He used to say he had found a copy of L&eacute;vi-Strauss's <span class="italic">Les structures &eacute;l&eacute;mentaires de la parent&eacute;</span> (1949) in an Oxford bookshop the week before going on fieldwork in Borneo. Primed by his knowledge of Dutch structural anthropology, he immediately recognized its significance and its concern with conceptual structure over social organization. Structuralism gave Needham a radically new approach to the study of kinship systems, the template for social structure in small-scale societies. An industrious scholar, he applied this new style in a series of brilliant papers in which he stressed the importance of alliance, through marriage, over that of descent. He established his reputation in 1962 with the publication of <span class="italic">Structure and Sentiment</span>, a highly polemical short work in which he argued convincingly for the power of structuralist approaches in the study of kinship systems over psychological ones, as advocated by the American anthropologists George Homans and David Schneider.<br>
<br>However, Needham's promotion of a strict L&eacute;vi-Straussian structuralism ended abruptly in 1969 when the French anthropologist somewhat unfairly attacked Needham's assiduous editing of the translation into English of his <span class="italic">Structures &eacute;l&eacute;mentaires</span>. Needham, ever the painstaking scholar, wanted to restrict L&eacute;vi-Strauss's ideas to those societies where they could be fruitfully applied. L&eacute;vi-Strauss would have none of this: he wanted his ideas to be generally applicable, not ethnographically restricted. This attack, alongside Needham's realization in the course of the translation that the power of L&eacute;vi-Strauss's approach owed as much to the rhetoric of his prose as to the incisiveness of his thought, led him to pursue and develop his own version of structuralism. From then on he only made reference to L&eacute;vi-Strauss in a critical vein, cutting through his oratorical excesses and moulding structuralism into a more exact practice. At one point he even suggested that L&eacute;vi-Strauss, who in wartime New York had participated in Andr&eacute; Breton's circle, should be regarded not as the famed exponent of structuralism but as &#145;the greatest Surrealist of them all&#146;  (&#145;The birth of the meaningful&#146;, <span class="italic">TLS</span>, 13 April 1984).<br>
<br>From the early 1970s onwards Needham published a stream of important books and articles on systems of classification, cognitive universals, indigenous psychologies, and kinship theory, in particular <span class="italic">Percussion and Transition</span> (1967), where he pointed out the global use of percussive sound in rites of passage, <span class="italic">Polythetic Classification</span> (1975), in which he contended that most terms used for cross-cultural comparison will not have simple definitions but are more akin to Wittgenstein's idea of family-resemblant concepts, <span class="italic">Skulls and Causality</span> (1976), where he argued against the unnecessary imposition of intermediary terms when trying to understand the causal reasoning of other peoples. He also edited the highly influential <span class="italic">Rethinking Kinship and Marriage</span> (1971) and <span class="italic">Right and Left: Essays on Dual Symbolic Classification</span> (1973). He was perhaps proudest of <span class="italic">Belief, Language and Experience</span> (1972), in which he performed a cross-cultural, cross-disciplinary investigation to argue that belief is not a human universal.<br>
<br>In the 1960s structuralism was viewed by its supporters in almost messianic terms as offering a new vision of the world. Thanks to the work of L&eacute;vi-Strauss, his champions, and his popularizers, the anthropological version of this approach gained a renown far beyond its usual disciplinary boundaries. Thanks to Needham, Oxford became a world centre for structuralist anthropology and attracted students from all over the globe. He was an exacting but kindly tutor who drilled his students both to take imaginative risks and to be ever sceptical. He regarded it as his academic duty to be exceptionally generous with his time for his students, and to be a forever loyal supporter of most of them. Many of those he had supervised regarded him as the greatest single academic influence in their lives, and an almost inimitable exemplar of dedicated, inspiring scholarship.<br>
<br>Needham, ever the polemicist, frequently enjoyed taking a contrary path to most of his colleagues. Thus he took particular pains to revive interest in anthropologist predecessors whose work, he felt, had been undervalued or overlooked. He and, at his behest, some of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s translated and edited books by, among others, Arnold van Gennep, A. M. Hocart, and Robert Hertz. But these re-editions sold badly. His students quietly confessed that they bought copies only to read his extended introductions. In his later years much of his most powerful work was published as series of essays, especially <span class="italic">Against the Tranquility of Axioms</span> (1983), <span class="italic">Exemplars</span> (1985), and <span class="italic">Counterpoints</span> (1987). Their individual chapters were models of elegant scepticism and have continued to serve as powerful cautionary tales for fledgeling anthropologists. By adopting an increasingly sceptical style in later life Needham's work echoed that of two of his heroes, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Lucien L&eacute;vy-Bruhl, both of whom spent the second half of their intellectual lives systematically questioning the positions they had advanced in the first half.<br>
<br>Needham's experience of the Second World War and his time with the Gurkhas were central to his life. He learnt Gurkhali and even in old age was able spontaneously to sing wartime songs in the language. It was important to him that, in his last years, he achieved reconciliation with Japanese veterans of a battle he had participated in. Several of them paid him visits in Oxford, some repeatedly. But, above all, Needham was a self-made Oxford man. He revelled both in its great traditions and in its petty ceremonies. As he was ready to admit, he created and lived a dream of Oxford. Many of his students, especially from abroad, were happy to join him in this. Though inclined towards atheism, he enjoyed attending the weekly ritual of the university sermon. At Sunday lunchtimes he would sit in the &#145;don's bar&#146; of the King's Arms, ready to hold court to whoever might turn up. This, he felt, was the way an Oxford don should comport himself. He loved classical music and painting. He was enchanted by form and was more interested in clarifying the conceptual structures underlying the nitty-gritty of daily life than examining their political manipulation. He would often lament that when attending a seminar in theoretical physics or mathematics he knew anthropology could not withstand comparison with such logically grounded subjects.<br>
<br>Uninterested in the analysis of power, Needham was ready to acknowledge that he was not very skilled at its deployment. In 1972 he was not chosen to succeed his mentor Sir Edward Evans-Pritchard in the Oxford chair, though many saw him as the leading candidate. He was finally awarded the post four years later. But some of his departmental colleagues soon came to regard him as over-eager to revitalize their centre. When, towards the end of the first year of his incumbency, senior members of the university overruled an administrative decision of his, he packed his books and moved into college rooms. He never returned to the department, though he remained in post until his retirement in 1990.<br>
<br>Needham was enamoured of many aspects of the United States, especially its landscape. In middle age he would often speak of his desire to abandon academia and run a ranch in Montana. After his retirement he took pleasure in repeated visits to New Mexico and Arizona. He cherished friendship and assiduously kept up a voluminous correspondence. Maintaining an almost military discipline to the end, he bore his long, final illness, the result of colonic cancer, with composure and good humour. In his last week he refused to enter a hospice as he did not wish to lose contact with his friends. He died from pulmonary fibrosis at his home, a Merton College flat at 56 Holywell Street, Oxford, on 4 December 2006. He was survived by his two sons.<br>
