<span class="headword">Tilley, Sir  Samuel Leonard</span>  (1818&#150;1896), <span class="occ">politician in Canada</span>, was born at Gagetown, New Brunswick, on 8 May 1818, the eldest son of Thomas Morgan Tilley, a storekeeper, and his wife, Susan, the daughter of William Peters, a farmer. Descended from loyalists on both sides, he was educated at the local Church of England school and grammar school, but at the age of thirteen he moved to Saint John and became apprenticed to a druggist. In 1838 he qualified as a pharmacist, and later established one of the largest drug stores in the province. A highly respected Saint John businessman, Tilley was an enthusiastic supporter of the evangelical wing of the Church of England, taught in Sunday school, and served as the most worthy patriarch of the Sons of Temperance. After the British government ended imperial preferences in the 1840s, he became a founder member of the Railway League and of the New Brunswick Colonial Association, which supported the protection of colonial industries. He was an early advocate of a federal union of British North America. On 6 May 1843 he married Julia Ann Hanford (<i>d</i>. 1862); they had eight children.<br>
<br>In 1850 Tilley was elected to the assembly for Saint John and joined the Reformers in opposition. In 1851, however, the unity of the Reform movement temporarily disintegrated, and he resigned from the assembly and devoted his energies to campaigning for prohibition. In 1852 he was re-elected for Saint John. When the Reformers took office he became provincial secretary, and revamped the province's financial system. He also introduced a stringent prohibition bill banning the sale of alcohol, which became law on 1 January 1856. The law aroused so much opposition that Lieutenant-Governor John Henry Manners-Sutton dissolved the assembly in May. Tilley's party&#151;dubbed the Smashers by their opponents&#151;suffered an overwhelming defeat, Tilley lost his seat, and the prohibition bill was repealed. A chastened Reform Party abandoned prohibition and won re-election in 1857. Tilley returned as provincial secretary, raised the provincial tariffs to the highest in British North America, and borrowed money in London to finance an ambitious programme of railway building. In 1860 he presided over the completion of the railway, optimistically called the European and North American, from Saint John to Shediac, but the construction costs raised the debt to unprecedented levels. In March 1861 Tilley became head of the Reform government, which was re-elected later that year.<br>
<br>Tilley's relations with the new lieutenant-governor, the arrogant Arthur Hamilton Gordon, were frequently uncomfortable. Although Tilley was prepared to discuss a legislative union of the three maritime colonies, to Gordon's dismay he preferred a larger confederation of all of British North America. Partly Tilley saw confederation as a means of funding an intercolonial railway to run across New Brunswick and link Nova Scotia and the united province of Canada. In 1861 and again in 1862 he went to London to try to persuade W. E. Gladstone, the chancellor of the exchequer, to give an imperial guarantee for a loan to finance the railway, but when Gladstone insisted on a sinking fund, the Canadian government withdrew from the arrangement and Tilley returned empty-handed. In 1863 he travelled to Quebec City for further negotiations, again to no avail. Although he pushed enabling legislation through the New Brunswick assembly, he faced considerable opposition from within his own party, and so in 1864 he committed the government to generous subsidies for regional railways within New Brunswick, stretching the colony's credit to its limits.<br>
<br>Tilley undoubtedly saw confederation as the means to build the Intercolonial Railway and free New Brunswick from its substantial debt, but he was motivated by more than mere financial considerations. Like most pro-confederates, he viewed with alarm the growing power of the United States. In 1861 he rushed home from England to assist in the arrangements for colonial defence during the <i>Trent</i> affair, and he was genuinely alarmed by the Fenian raids in 1866. He sincerely believed that the imperial connection could not be preserved unless the British North American colonies formed a new (but not independent) nation under the British crown. When the &#145;Great Coalition&#146; in Canada in 1864 embraced confederation, Tilley abandoned his lukewarm support for maritime union and strongly endorsed confederation at the Charlottetown conference in September 1864. At the Quebec conference in October he headed the New Brunswick delegation and helped to shape the constitutional arrangements for a federal union. But when he returned to New Brunswick he found the tide running against the proposed terms of union. In February 1865 the pro-confederates were overwhelmed at the polls and Tilley was defeated. Within a year the anti-confederate administration, internally divided between those seeking better terms and those adamantly opposed to confederation, fell apart, and a second election in May 1866 brought the confederates back to power. Tilley passed the necessary enabling legislation and sailed for England to participate in the London conference, where a measure was prepared for the British parliament. Tilley was able to persuade the delegates to improve the financial terms on which New Brunswick entered confederation, and he vetoed an attempt to entrench denominational schools in the Maritimes. He is also believed to have suggested calling the new country the dominion of Canada, a title he took from <span class="roman">Psalm 72</span>. For his efforts he was made a CB on 1 July 1867 and was created a KCMG in 1879. He married Alice Starr Chipman on 22 October 1867; they had two children.<br>
<br>In the new federal administration Tilley initially held the comparatively lowly post of minister of customs. In February 1873 he was promoted to minister of finance, but only briefly held office before the government was forced to resign. In November he was appointed lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick, and so did not stand in the election of 1874, which saw the Conservatives decimated. Even though he held a theoretically non-partisan office, he helped to organize Conservative clubs across the province and to formulate the party's platform for the election of 1878, in which the Conservatives campaigned for a &#145;national policy&#146; of tariff protection. As minister of finance he introduced the new policy, raising the Canadian tariff in 1879 to encourage investment in Canadian industry. The tariff structure he created remained essentially unaltered until the end of his life. As minister of finance he was less happy with the government's almost open-ended commitment to the Canadian Pacific Railway, and he became increasingly isolated in the cabinet. In 1885 he fell ill and retired as minister of finance, but was reappointed lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick in November and held the post until autumn 1893. A member of the Imperial Federation League, he opposed unrestricted reciprocity in 1891, and in 1896 he bravely published a letter defending the right of Manitoba Catholics to denominational schools. On 25 June 1896 he died of blood poisoning in Saint John, where he was then buried.<br>
<br>A man with deep religious convictions but also a pragmatist prepared to abandon prohibition when its unpopularity became obvious, and to work with Roman Catholics even though he abhorred their religious values, Tilley was easily the most important New Brunswick politician of his generation. An early advocate of protection and a railway enthusiast, he laid the basis of a modern industrial economy in New Brunswick. A firm supporter of confederation, he led his province into the federal union, and without New Brunswick confederation could not have taken place. Tilley was the real architect of the &#145;national policy&#146;, a policy not entirely abandoned until 1988. Although less colourful than many of his contemporaries, he was one of the most important fathers of confederation.<br>
