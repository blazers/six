<span class="headword">Prior,  Thomas Abiel</span>  (1809&#150;1886), <span class="occ">line engraver</span>, was born on 5 November 1809. His early work was done for the publishers Henry Fisher and George Vertue and consisted of landscapes of Britain, the Mediterranean region, China, and America. He first distinguished himself with a print, <span class="italic">Heidelberg Castle and Town</span> (1844), engraved on copper from one of Turner's drawings that he had bought, and executed under Turner's supervision. It was published by subscription, and its success led to its re-engraving on steel for the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> (1864). After one plate in mezzotint, <span class="italic">More Frightened than Hurt</span>, after James Bateman, Prior returned to line engraving, executing several more plates after Turner, including <span class="italic">Zurich</span> (1852), <span class="italic">Dido Building Carthage</span> (1863), <span class="italic">Apollo and the Sibyl</span> (1873)&#151;the latter two were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1864 and 1874 respectively&#151;and <span class="italic">The Sun Rising in a Mist</span> (begun by William Chapman; 1874). Other plates were engraved for the Turner Gallery and the Vernon Gallery. He produced <span class="italic">Crossing the Bridge</span> after Sir Edwin Landseer, and fourteen plates on steel for the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> between 1850 and 1871, notably several pictures from the Royal Collection, among them <span class="italic">The Windmill</span>, after Ruysdael; <span class="italic">The Village F&ecirc;te</span>, after David Teniers; <span class="italic">Dover</span>, after George Chambers; <span class="italic">The Opening of the New London Bridge</span>, after Clarkson Stanfield; and <span class="italic">Constantinople: the Golden Horn</span>, after Jacobus Jacobs.<br>
<br>Prior married on 18 November 1837 Emma Sharrow; she may have died about 1860, for at this time he went to live in Calais to be near his son, Thomas William Prior (<i>b</i>. 1838). He taught drawing at one or two of the schools in Calais, which considerably slowed down the rate of his own work. The large plates of his <span class="italic">Dido</span> and <span class="italic">Apollo</span>, produced during these years, were considered to be his best works. It was Prior's custom to visit England annually, to oversee the proving of his plates. In September 1886 he completed his large engraving of <span class="italic">The Fighting T&eacute;m&eacute;raire</span>. Its publication drew admiring comments in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, which noted that Prior was &#145;one of the last surviving masters of the now obsolete method of line engraving&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 2 Nov 1886, 8a). A few days later the same newspaper reported his death at Calais on 8 November 1886.<br>
