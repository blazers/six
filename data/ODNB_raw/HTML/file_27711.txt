<span class="headword">Tresham, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1500&#150;1559), <span class="occ">landowner and prior of the hospital of St John of Jerusalem in England</span>, was the only son of John Tresham (<i>d</i>. 1521) of Rushton Hall, Northamptonshire. Following the death of Thomas's mother, his father married Isabel (<i>d</i>. 1558), daughter of Sir James Harrington of Hornby, Lancashire. The Treshams were a leading Northamptonshire gentry family: Thomas's eponymous grandfather had served Henry VI as comptroller of the household, and was executed following the battle of Tewkesbury; upon the accession of Henry VII his son John was restored to the family's estates, and was named sheriff of Northamptonshire in 1505. Thomas Tresham married Anne, daughter of William, Lord Parr, and together they had at least three sons and a daughter. Following Anne's death, in November 1540 Thomas married Lettice Lee (<i>d</i>. in or before 1557), daughter of Sir Thomas Peniston of Hawridge, Buckinghamshire, and successively widow of Robert Knollys (<i>d</i>. 1521) and of Sir Robert Lee (<i>d</i>. 1539).<br>
<br>Although an extraordinary esquire of the body as early as 1516 and knighted by 1524, Tresham was no courtier, rarely attending the court save for state occasions such as the arrival of Anne of Cleves (1539) or the reception of the French ambassador (1546). Moreover his military experience under Henry VIII was limited to helping to suppress the Pilgrimage of Grace, and to service in the English army sent into France in 1544. But he was active in the government of his native Northamptonshire, where he was both a JP and gaol delivery commissioner. Pricked four times as sheriff (1524, 1539, 1548, and 1555), Tresham's high standing in his native county was reflected in a recommendation of 1532 to Thomas Cromwell that he would make the sort of &#145;substantial sheriff&#146; the shire needed. He was also a stalwart member of special county commissions. For example, in 1530 he was responsible for preparing an inventory of the lands held by Cardinal Wolsey within the county, while in 1551 he was a county commissioner for assessing the relief, and one of the commissioners appointed to regulate the price of food in local markets. Tresham represented his native county as a knight of the shire in the parliament of 1539, and again in 1542 (and perhaps 1545). His hostility towards religious reform excluded him from the parliaments of Edward VI, although he continued his service as a JP and county commissioner, and served under the earl of Warwick in the suppression of Kett's rebellion.<br>
<br>Upon the death of Edward VI in July 1553, Tresham moved swiftly to support Princess Mary's claim to the throne. Refusing to muster on behalf of the duke of Northumberland and ignoring the council's orders to recognize Jane Grey as queen, with the support of the citizens of Northampton Tresham proclaimed Mary as queen, and was later placed in command of a company of soldiers which protected her during Wyatt's rebellion. Tresham's decisive actions in July 1553 earned him Mary's gratitude, which took the form of a cash reward, together with the lease of the property of Pipewell Abbey near Rushton. In October 1553 he returned to Westminster as MP for Lancaster, before resuming his rank as first knight for Northamptonshire in the two parliaments of 1554 (as sheriff in 1555 he was ineligible for election). At the same time Tresham served the crown in various unofficial capacities: in May 1554 he escorted Edward Courtenay, earl of Devon, from the Tower to Fotheringhay Castle, while during the summer of 1555 he was called upon to investigate seditious bills circulating in the county. As sheriff in August 1557 he also supervised the burning of a Northamptonshire shoemaker for heresy.<br>
<br>Among the first steps toward the full restoration of the dissolved religious orders in England fervently desired by Queen Mary, in late 1557 it was decided to re-establish the order of St John of Jerusalem in England, with the recently widowed Thomas Tresham as its prior, apparently as a further reward for his earlier loyalty. At Whitehall on 30 November 1557, in the presence of Mary and Cardinal Pole, Tresham and four colleagues took the cross as knights of the order, and Tresham was installed as prior (the order did not receive its landed endowment from the crown, however, until April 1558). Although now a member of the House of Lords, Prior Tresham rarely attended, for he was frequently occupied elsewhere in royal service. In January 1558 he was appointed a commander in the abortive expedition to recover Calais, while in March he was on the Isle of Wight supervising the hasty improvement of defences before an anticipated French invasion.<br>
<br>Throughout the decades of religious turmoil Tresham remained a faithful Catholic. His devotion was shared by his sister Clemence, formerly a nun at Syon, and inherited by his grandson Thomas, who became a notable Northamptonshire recusant. Upon the accession of Elizabeth, an Italian in Tresham's service reported that his master intended &#145;to observe the old rite secretly&#146;, as he had done during the reign of Edward VI  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1558&#150;80</i>, 31). Prior Tresham did not have to conceal his faith for long, however, for he died at Rushton on 1 March 1559, even before the order of St John was dissolved in England and its properties confiscated once more. He was buried on 16 March in St Peter's Church, Rushton, where a fine alabaster monument was erected in the chancel, depicting the prior recumbent in his robes; it was transferred in 1799 to nearby All Saints' Church. Tresham had drawn up his will on 28 November 1557, before embracing the religious life, and amended its contents on 11 September 1558; it was proved by his executors on 4 May 1559. He referred in his will to his buying and selling of lands. He had inherited a rather dispersed estate in Northamptonshire, which he had consolidated into two blocks, centred upon Rushton (his principal seat) and Lyveden respectively. But that was the limit of his achievement, for he made no effort to introduce up-to-date methods of estate management, and it clearly mattered most to him that his heir should come into an unencumbered inheritance. There is an evident note of satisfaction in his reported claim to the latter that &#145;I shall leave you all your land out of joynture or dower and free from wardshipp, and not a fote of that subject to any statut for inclosure, and verie lytle or none in lease and no part of my rente of inheritance in any sort improved other then my mannor in Houghton&#146;  (Finch, 71). All Tresham's sons had predeceased him, and the beneficiary of his outmoded attitude towards his lands was his grandson, another <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27712/', "Thomas Tresham")</script>, who inherited a valuable estate ripe for exploitation.<br>
