<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Roberts, Sir  Bryan Clieve</span>  (1923&#150;1996), <span class="occ">lawyer and civil servant</span>, was born on 22 March 1923 at Southsea, one of twin sons of Herbert Roberts, educationist, and his wife, Doris Evelyn, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clieve. His father had taught at Radley College and London University before becoming director of education for Croydon. Roberts grew up mainly in Blackheath. He was educated at Whitgift School and in 1941 he joined the Royal Artillery in the ranks. Commissioned the following year into the 13th (Honourable Artillery Company) regiment, Royal Horse Artillery, he took part in the Normandy landings and served throughout the battle for north-west Europe as a liaison officer in 11th armoured division. His twin brother, Peter, a fellow gunner, was killed while crossing the Rhine, a loss which affected Roberts profoundly. After the war he went up in 1946 to Magdalen College, Oxford, graduating with a second-class degree in jurisprudence in 1948. He was called to the bar by Gray's Inn in 1950. He was in private practice for a short time before serving in the Treasury solicitor's department from 1951 to 1953.<br>
<br>Post-war English life did not suit Roberts, and in 1953 he left for Northern Rhodesia where he served for eight years, first as crown counsel and latterly as director of public prosecutions. On 3 January 1958 he married Pamela Dorothy Campbell, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Knight (<i>b</i>. 1920). There were no children of the marriage. In 1961 Sir Glyn Jones, the new governor of what was then still the British colony of Nyasaland, offered Roberts the post of solicitor-general. In the same year he was appointed queen's counsel for the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Promotion came swiftly. Within twelve months he was made minister of justice and then, after Nyasaland became independent as Malawi, in 1964 he was appointed attorney-general. In the following year his role was expanded to include the posts of cabinet secretary, permanent secretary to the office of the president, Dr Hastings Banda, and head of the Malawi civil service. A year later he also became chairman of the Malawi army council, the national security and intelligence council, and the national development and planning council. From then until he retired, he was Banda's principal adjutant and close adviser.<br>
<br>Malawi underwent considerable turmoil after independence, and it was much to Roberts's credit that he was able to cope with a number of difficult disturbances. These included a cabinet revolt shortly after independence, in which all of Banda's ministers either resigned or were dismissed, two armed uprisings, and changes to the criminal justice system which resulted in the resignation of the entire high court bench. At this time the president faced considerable hostility both within the country and abroad. Despite this he continued to be successful as head of the newly independent country, and was able to achieve considerable economic stability. It was perhaps significant that his most authoritarian decisions, which attracted considerable criticism, took place after Roberts had retired. Roberts worked for the president for nearly ten years, returning to England in part because his mother's health was deteriorating. His success with Banda was due to a number of factors, principally because from the start he identified very clearly with the president's objectives, so that when he disagreed with him, which when necessary he was prepared to do with courage, Banda trusted his judgement. In addition, he was swift and very decisive in what he thought and did, qualities which clearly appealed to the president. In 1973, the year after his retirement, he was made KCMG (having been appointed CMG in 1964).<br>
<br>On his return to England, Roberts joined the Lord Chancellor's Department and worked for a time for his former pupil-master, Lord Hailsham. He was initially responsible for the training of lay magistrates, which at that time was a novelty and which he largely pioneered. His marriage to Pamela Campbell ended in divorce on 1 March 1976, and on 10 July 1976 he married Brigitte Monica Briony Reilly-Morrison, formerly Bridget Monica Patricia Morrison, lecturer, daughter of William Reilly, police inspector. Again there were no children of the marriage. In 1977 Roberts was promoted to under-secretary and was appointed secretary of commissions. In that capacity he was responsible for advising the lord chancellor on the appointment and work of the magistracy. He also energetically developed his predecessor's work with the Commonwealth Magistrates' Association, of which he served as chairman from 1979, before becoming life vice-president in 1994. In 1982 he was appointed a stipendiary magistrate for inner London, a role which he filled with vigour for the next eleven years. In the course of that time he sat in practically every court in inner London. He found the work congenial, and gained a reputation for tolerance combined with sharp insight. A characteristic enquiry to a defendant was &#145;If you were parking, how is it you were exceeding the speed limit?&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>).<br>
<br>In appearance, Roberts was tall, spare and elegantly dressed. He had a sardonic sense of humour and a passion for exact English. His second marriage having also ended in divorce, on 5 October 1985 he married Elizabeth Barbara Jane Forter, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wood, with whom he knew much happiness until his death from cancer at the St Charles's Hospice, London, on 6 December 1996. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
