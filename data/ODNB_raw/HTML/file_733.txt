<span class="headword">Asgill, Sir  Charles</span>, second baronet  (1762&#150;1823), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 6 April 1762 and baptized at St Swithin London Stone on 3 May 1762, the only son of Sir Charles Asgill, first baronet (<i>d</i>. 1788), and his second wife, daughter of Daniel Pratville, secretary to Sir Benjamin Harris, ambassador to Spain. The first baronet had risen from a clerkship to a partnership in a bank. He was alderman from 1749 to 1777, was made sheriff and knighted in 1752, became lord mayor in 1757, was made a baronet in 1761, and died on 15 September 1788. The son entered the army on 27 February 1778, as ensign in the 1st foot guards, and became lieutenant in the same regiment with the rank of captain on 3 February 1781.<br>
<br>In 1781 Asgill was ordered to North America, joining the army commanded by the Marquess Cornwallis. With the capture of Yorktown, Virginia, in the following October, Asgill was taken prisoner. Several months afterwards a Captain Huddy, an officer in the American army, was captured by some loyalists and hanged by a party under the command of Captain Lippincot in retaliation for the death of a loyalist, Philip White. This incident led Washington to demand that the British general, Sir Henry Clinton, surrender Lippincot. Sir Henry, while disavowing the act &#145;with unmeasured severity&#146;, refused to give up Lippincot, and referred the matter to a court martial. Washington's reaction was to order that a British captain should be drawn by lot from those in captivity and sentenced to death if Lippincot was not executed, and he wrote to Sir Henry to that end. The lot fell on Asgill. The court martial which tried Lippincot acquitted him, on the ground that the responsibility for the act lay mainly with the Board of Associated Loyalists at New York, the president of which had verbally ordered Lippincot to execute the prisoner. Sir Henry sent the proceedings of the court martial to Washington, who, considering the British commander's disavowal and censure of the act, and the irresponsible nature of Lippincot's conduct, was inclined to release Asgill.<br>
<br>When Asgill's mother heard what had happened, she made a pitiful appeal to the comte de Vergennes, the French prime minister, to intervene on behalf of her son. The <i>comte</i> disclosed the matter to Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette, and, directed by them, sent an urgent appeal to Washington, who forwarded the letter to the American congress. On 7 November an act was passed by congress releasing Asgill, who immediately returned on parole to England.<br>
<br>On the death of his father in 1788 Asgill succeeded to the baronetcy, and in 1790 he married Sophia Jemima, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20606/', "Admiral Sir Chaloner Ogle")</script>. Soon afterwards he was appointed equerry to the duke of York, and on 3 March 1790 was promoted to a company in the guards with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In late 1793 he joined the army of the duke of York on the continent, and served throughout the campaign in Flanders and the retreat, before returning home. On 26 February 1795 he was promoted to the rank of colonel, in 1797 to that of brigadier in Ireland, and on 1 January 1798 to that of major-general; during 1798 he was actively engaged in suppressing the Irish uprising. On 9 May 1800 he was appointed colonel of the 46th foot, and placed in command of the garrison of Dublin, and occasionally oversaw the training camp at the Curragh. He obtained the rank of lieutenant-general on 1 February 1805, the colonelcy of the 5th West India regiment, and of the 85th foot in 1806, and that of the 11th foot on 25 February 1807, for which he raised a second battalion. He remained on the staff until 1812, and was promoted general on 4 June 1814. When he died in 1823 the baronetcy became extinct.<br>
