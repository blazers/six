<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vaughan,  Henry</span>  (1621&#150;1695), <span class="occ">writer and translator of devotional works</span>, was born at Newton by Usk in the parish of Llansanffraid (St Bridget's), Brecknockshire, the eldest known child of Thomas Vaughan (<i>c</i>.1586&#150;1658), of Tretower, and Denise Jenkin (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1593), only daughter and heir of David and Gwenllian Morgan, of Llansanffraid. Vaughan was the elder of twins; his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28148/', "Thomas Vaughan (1621&#150;1666)")</script> was also an author, under the pseudonym Eugenius Philalethes. Vaughan could claim kinship with two powerful Welsh families, one Catholic and one protestant. His paternal grandmother, Frances, was the natural daughter of Thomas Somerset, who spent some twenty-four years in the Tower of London for his adherence to Catholicism. As she survived into Vaughan's boyhood, there may have been some direct Catholic influence upon his early nurturing. Vaughan shared a common ancestry with the Herbert family through the daughter of the famous warrior of Agincourt Dafydd ap Llywelyn, the &#145;Davy Gam, esquire&#146; of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Henry V</span>. He is not known to have claimed kinship with George Herbert, but must surely have been aware of the connection.<h2>
<a name="Education"></a>Education</h2>Thomas later remarked that &#145;<i>English</i> is a <i>Language</i> the <i>Author</i> was <i>not born to</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Thomas Vaughan</span>, 94). Their father, however, had a command of English, and they were probably bilingual. Both boys were sent to school under Matthew Herbert, rector of Llangattock, and both wrote tributes to him. Since their interest was so clearly shared, the two brothers' intimate acquaintance with hermeticism may have dated from those years. Herbert doubtless reinforced the devotion to church and monarchy that the boys would have learned at home. Like several others among Vaughan's clerical acquaintances, he was to prove uncompromising during the interregnum, suffering sequestration and imprisonment and narrowly avoiding banishment.<br>
<br>The buttery books of Jesus College, Oxford, show that Thomas was admitted to the college in May 1638  (Hutchinson, 30), and it has long been assumed that Henry went up at the same time, though Wood states that &#145;he made his first entry into Jesus College in Michaelmas term 1638, aged 17 years&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 926). There is no clear record, as there is in Thomas's case, to establish Henry's residence or matriculation, but the assumption of his association with Oxford, supported by his inclusion in <span class="italic">Athenae Oxonienses</span>, is reasonable enough. He informed Aubrey, who wrote to him on Wood's behalf, &#145;I stayed not att Oxford to take any degree&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Henry Vaughan</span>, 687). Recent research in the Jesus College archives suggests that &#145;Henry did not enter Jesus College before 1641, unless he did so in 1639 without matriculating or paying an admission fee, and left before the record in the surviving Buttery Books resumes in December of that year&#146;  (Allen, &#145;The Vaughans at Jesus College, Oxford, 1638&#150;48&#146;). The suggestion that Henry went to Oxford some time after Thomas may be strengthened by a comparison of the poems each wrote for the 1651 edition of the <span class="italic">Comedies, Tragi-Comedies, with Other Poems</span> of William Cartwright, who had died in 1643. Thomas had clearly attended Cartwright's lectures, which were the great draw of the time (&#145;When He did read, how did we flock to hear!&#146;; <span class="italic">Works of Thomas Vaughan</span>, 582), while Henry apparently had not, since he begins his verses &#145;I did but see thee&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Poems</span>, 88). On the other hand Hutchinson thought that a reference, in &#145;On Sir Thomas Bodley's library; the author being then in Oxford&#146;, to the library being T-shaped (&#145;all our fame / Meets here to speak one letter of thy name&#146;) suggests a date before 1640, when the addition of the Selden end produced the shape of an H  (Hutchinson, 31).<br>
<br>It was quite usual for elder sons of the gentry not to graduate, and to proceed to the inns of court. In the letter to Aubrey already cited, dated 15 June 1673, Vaughan wrote that he &#145;was sent to London, beinge then designed by my father for the study of the Law, which the sudden eruption of our late civil warres wholie frustrated&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Henry Vaughan</span>, 687). If he indeed left London upon the outbreak of civil war, that would have been soon after Charles raised his standard at Nottingham on 22 August 1642. The mist which surrounds Vaughan's Oxford career is not dispelled by Aubrey, who writes &#145;<i>Eugenius Philalethes</i> was of Jesus College. Whither Henry was I have forgotten; but he was a Clarke sometime to Judge Sir Marmaduke Lloyd&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 303). Such employment seems probable enough: Vaughan said that he had been sent to London to study law, and he and Lloyd had their ardent royalism in common. Vaughan could have held this position from 1642 to 1645; Lloyd was taken prisoner at the siege of Hereford in December 1645, fined, and dismissed from his position as judge.<br>
<br>Apart from the periods of study, at Llangattock, Oxford, and one of the inns of court, Vaughan's life was spent in his native village. His first wife was Catherine Wise, daughter of Richard and Lucy Wise of Gilsdon Hall, Coleshill, Warwickshire. They were probably married before the publication of <span class="italic">Poems</span> in 1646, and had four children, Thomas, Lucy, Frances, and Catherine. The date of Catherine Wise's death is unknown, but the elegy &#145;Fair and Young Light&#146; in the 1655 <span class="italic">Silex scintillans</span> probably celebrates her memory.<h2>
<a name="Militaryservice"></a>Military service</h2>The Latin poem addressed to posterity prefaced to <span class="italic">Olor Iscanus</span> (1651) was once thought to indicate that Vaughan had not fought in the civil war; a more likely interpretation is that he had not fought on the wrong side, had not taken part in the &#145;great overthrow&#146; which had swept away the church, the monarch, and the peace of the kingdom. His &#145;An elegy on the death of Mr. R. W. Slain in the late unfortunate differences at Rowton Heath, near Chester, 1645&#146; clearly suggests that he participated in that battle. Further, among the &#145;Captaines&#146; taken prisoner on 24 September 1645 after the royalist defeat at Rowton Heath we find Thomas Vaughan. Henry Vaughan seems to have been among the survivors of Rowton Heath who withdrew to Beeston Castle, about 9 miles south-east of Chester, which surrendered in November 1645  (<span class="italic">Works of Thomas Vaughan</span>, 6). In the splendid humorous poem &#145;Upon a cloak lent him by Mr. J. Ridsley&#146; Vaughan refers to &#145;that day, when we / Left craggy <i>Beeston</i>, and the fatal <i>Dee</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Poems</span>, 84). Moreover, his name appears in a list, dated 1663, of officers claiming their share in relief promised by the crown, just where we would expect it, along with &#145;Cap. Tho. Vaughan&#146; in the company of Colonel Sir Herbert Price, of Brecon Priory  (Hutchinson, 64&#150;5). Vaughan's younger brother William (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1628) died on 14 July 1648, possibly as a result of wounds or sickness incurred during the second civil war, and Vaughan mourned William's death in a series of fine elegies.<h2>
<a name="Vaughanaspoettranslatorandwriterofdevotionalprose"></a>Vaughan as poet, translator, and writer of devotional prose</h2>Henry Vaughan's first volume, <span class="italic">Poems, with the Tenth Satire of Juvenal Englished</span>, appeared in 1646. The civil war had been in progress for four years, and Vaughan had by then seen military service. Two major causes of distress were still in the future: the death of his beloved younger brother William in 1648, and the execution of Charles I in 1649. The title-page indicated the author's status as gentleman, and its preface is addressed to &#145;Gentlemen&#146; whose &#145;more refined spirits out-wing these dull Times, and soar above the drudgery of dirty intelligence&#146;. Vaughan claims detachment, yet he reminds his readers that they are living in &#145;the dregs of an age&#146;. He is aware that his love poems might seem anachronistic; the echoes of Habington's <span class="italic">Castara</span>, a celebration of wedded chastity, would have appealed to Charles I and Henrietta Maria. In reference to his translation he describes Juvenal as one whose pen &#145;had as much true passion, for the infirmities of that state, as we should have pity, to the distractions of our own&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Poems</span>, 31). He hints darkly, and with good reason, at topical application.<br>
<br>In the <span class="italic">Poems</span> of 1646 we find, lightly handled, themes and interests that will take on deeper resonance in the later <span class="italic">Silex</span> (the theme of the restoration of all things, for example, in &#145;To my Ingenuous Friend, R. W.&#146; and in &#145;Upon the Priory Grove&#146;). On the other hand, some of the more successful poems differ markedly from Vaughan's mature verse, suggesting that religious lyricism was not his sole talent. Lines 35&#150;56 of &#145;A Rhapsody&#146; indicate that Vaughan had used his eyes and imagination to some purpose during his time in London; lines 27&#150;36 of &#145;To Amoret Weeping&#146; show that Vaughan had read or heard the Jacobean dramatists with attention: he captures their manner, their concreteness of moral perception, very well. &#145;A Rhapsody&#146; also suggests that in spite of his claim to detachment, Vaughan had been considerably stirred by the political events of the time.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Olor Iscanus</span>, published in 1651 but with a preface dated 17 December 1647, is the book one might expect from a young royalist of that time and place. Vaughan writes a joking poem on his poverty (the royalist ruined in his fortunes); he writes verse letters to his friends (as royalists scattered by their adversities did); he writes elegies for acquaintances slain in battle; he participates (at one remove in the case of Fletcher and directly in the case of Cartwright) in two of the great royalist publishing ventures of the time. One royalist theme, treated in the secular verse with uncommon <i>gravitas</i>, is that of retirement. Vaughan treats this theme mostly through translation, of the poems of Ovid written during his banishment, of those of Boethius written during his imprisonment. Vaughan's treatment of the Horatian theme of the royalist contentedly retired to his estates is unconventional. In translating the Polish Jesuit neo-Latin poet Casimir Sarbiewski, he answers Horace's &#145;Beatus ille&#146; ode with the reflection that the<blockquote>
<div class="indent">worldly he &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>Ploughing his own <i>fields</i>, seldom can<br>
</div>
<div>Be justly styled, <i>the blessed man</i>,<br>
</div>
</blockquote>for &#145;That title only fits a <i>Saint</i>&#146;, who<blockquote>
<div class="indent">can gladly part<br>
</div>
<div>With <i>house</i> and <i>lands</i>, and leave<br>
</div>
<div class="indent">&hellip; [the] loud strife<br>
</div>
<div>Of this world for a better life.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Complete Poems</span>, 127)</blockquote>In <span class="italic">Silex scintillans</span> the theme of retirement deepens into the theme of hiddenness. There we see it in such poems as &#145;The Book&#146;, where the world of all that has lived within nature is hidden in the artefact which is the book, waiting for that day when God will &#145;make all new again&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Poems</span>, 310); we see it in the alchemical imagery of the poem &#145;Holy Scriptures&#146;, when Vaughan addresses the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and says,<blockquote>
<div>In thee the hidden stone, the <i>manna</i> lies,<br>
</div>
<div>Thou art the great <i>elixir</i>, rare and choice;<br>
</div> (ibid., 198)</blockquote>we see it in &#145;The Timber&#146;, where Vaughan relates death to new life, to the growing up of fresh groves and the shooting of green branches, &#145;While the low <i>violet</i> thrives at their root&#146;  (ibid., 262); we see it in &#145;The Seed Growing Secretly&#146;, with its typical reference to that &#145;Dear, secret <i>greenness</i>!&#146; which is nursed below the level of tempests and winds, and whose growth is apparent only to God  (ibid., 277); we see it even more movingly expressed in the elegiac poem &#145;I Walked the Other Day&#146;, in which the poet represents himself as digging in winter in a place where he had once<blockquote>
<div>seen the soil to yield<br>
</div>
<div>A gallant flower,<br>
</div>
</blockquote>and there<blockquote>
<div>saw the warm recluse alone to lie<br>
</div>
<div>Where fresh and green<br>
</div>
<div>He lived of us unseen.<br>
</div> (ibid., 240&#150;41)</blockquote>We see it, finally, in the hidden God of &#145;The Night&#146;, in whom there is a &#145;deep but dazzling darkness&#146;, and in whose night the poet wishes to &#145;live invisible and dim&#146;  (ibid., 290).<br>
<br>In virtually all these examples the theme of hiddenness is linked with the theme of potentiality, as expressed through notions like new growth, alchemical transmutation, resurrection of the dead. If our &#145;life is hid with Christ in God&#146;  (<span class="roman">Colossians</span> 3: 3), then the possibility of new life, of transfiguration, is there. Vaughan brings together the notion of potentiality as expressed through alchemical philosophy and the same notion as expressed through the parables of the kingdom, in which mustard seeds grow into great trees, or scattered seed brings forth a hundredfold, in which, that is, hidden and apparently insignificant things gather to a greatness. Vaughan's response in such poems as these is religious and spiritual rather than directly political. Nevertheless, it is a spiritual response to a political situation. Whether drawing on Dante or on more ancient sources, Vaughan was aware of the polysemous possibilities of poetry; so much in his world is hidden, quietly biding its time, waiting for a new life, that the alert and sympathetic contemporary reader may have seen in such images hidden and buried royalism and Anglicanism waiting for their potentialities to be actualized, for their new day to dawn.<br>
<br>Most of Vaughan's work in prose consists of translations, the titles of which make clear their application to historical circumstance, for example <span class="italic">Of the Benefit wee may Get by our Enemies</span>, <span class="italic">The Praise and Happinesse of the Countrie-Life</span>, <span class="italic">The World Contemned</span>, <span class="italic">Of Temperance and Patience</span>. A significant original work is <span class="italic">The Mount of Olives, or, Solitary Devotions</span> (1652). Vaughan may well have thought of it as an alternative to the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, use of which was proscribed. It is interesting that, in spite of the Anglican rite being banned, Vaughan provides prayers, a meditation, and admonitions in relation to receiving &#145;the holy Communion&#146;, as well as &#145;A Prayer in Time of Persecution and Heresie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Henry Vaughan</span>, 160&#150;66). It seems probable that clandestine services were held, yet in the Brecon gaol records for the relevant period only one prosecution for use of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> has been found.<h2>
<a name="Vaughanasmedicalpractitioner"></a>Vaughan as medical practitioner</h2>In his letter to Aubrey of 15 June 1673 Vaughan wrote that his brother's employment was in &#145;physic and Chymistrie&#146;, and added, &#145;My profession also is physic, whch I have practised now for many years with good success (I thank god!) &amp; a repute big enough for a person of greater parts than my selfe.&#146; Both Hutchinson and the two women, Gwenllian Morgan and Louise Guiney, on whose researches he based his biography, gave careful attention to the questions of when Vaughan is likely to have begun work as a medical practitioner and where he received his medical degree. They found no evidence that Vaughan had graduated in medicine from any British or European university. Legal documents dated 1677, 1690, 1691, 1693, and 1695 refer to Vaughan as doctor of medicine or of &#145;physick&#146;, but he himself does not use the title, referring to himself only as &#145;Physitian&#146;  (Hutchinson, 190). He is described as &#145;M.D.&#146; on his gravestone. Hutchinson conceded that the College of Physicians would probably have been unable to enforce regulations against unlicensed practitioners in a county so remote as Brecknockshire; but he thought it unlikely that &#145;a man of honour like Henry Vaughan would have adopted the custom of none too scrupulous astrologers, or have suffered popular use to give him a degree to which he was not entitled&#146;  (ibid., 193). Such an assumption may well be anachronistic; it certainly dates from an era when the literary persona of the author of <span class="italic">Silex scintillans</span> was assumed to be virtually identical with the man himself. In Vaughan's translation of Heinrich Nolle, <span class="italic">Hermetical Physick</span> (1655), we find &#145;And after all the coyl of Academical licentiated Doctors, he onely is the true Physician, created so by the light of Nature, to whom Nature her selfe hath taught and manifested her proper and genuine operations by Experience&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Henry Vaughan</span>, 581). The first nine words of this sentence are Vaughan's interpolation, and suggest that if he was acting as a physician by 1655, he was unlicensed.<br>
<br>The twinship and obviously shared intellectual interests of Thomas and Henry make some comparison of their careers relevant. Thomas was evicted from his living in 1650, and needed a source of income. In a letter of May 1650 Samuel Hartlib noted that he &#145;for some years hath tried Chymical or Physical Conclusions&#146;, and we also learn from Hartlib that in that year there was a project to form a &#145;chymical club&#146; of which Vaughan was to be a member. It seems likely that this society was actually formed  (<span class="italic">Works of Thomas Vaughan</span>, 11&#150;13). Thomas was married on 28 September 1651, and his wife, Rebecca, died on 17 April 1658. He writes in his manuscript notebook &#145;Aqua vitae: non vitis&#146; (BL, Sloane MS 1741) that he had employed himself all her lifetime &#145;in the Acquisition of some naturall secrets&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Thomas Vaughan</span>, 588). There is also an apparent reference to Henry Vaughan's first wife staying with them in London and making, with Rebecca, &#145;a great glass of eye-water&#146;  (ibid., 17). Thomas Vaughan's alchemical and &#145;philosophical&#146; publications run from 1650 to 1655. He seems to have been working at &#145;physick&#146; for some considerable time before 1655, the date before which, Hutchinson argued, Henry could not have given himself to continuous medical training. If Hartlib is to be trusted, Thomas's work in &#145;physick&#146; began before 1650. If Henry Vaughan's position as a legal clerk ended in or before 1645, it is likely enough that he would have needed at least some supplementary income. His father was a younger son, there is reference in the verse to poverty, and, given its strongly royalist leanings, the family is unlikely to have prospered financially during the civil war. Vaughan's clerical neighbour Rowland Watkyns, who was dispossessed in 1648, probably practised as a physician while he was deprived of his living, and he and Vaughan may have been rivals. If a dispossessed cleric could have been an unlicensed practitioner, why not the elder son of a poor royalist gentry family who had completed no other professional training? After all, Vaughan's interest in hermetic authors, whose writing had practical as well as theoretical implications, can be documented from the poems as early as 1650.<br>
<br>Since Hutchinson's biography, further evidence that Vaughan was taking a strong interest in medicine before 1655 has come to light. Fourteen medical books he once owned are now in the Library Company of Philadelphia. Probably Vaughan's widow at his death sent them to Bristol, the nearest market, where they were purchased by Dr William Logan, then practising medicine in Bristol. Logan's library was sent to America after his death, and incorporated into the library of his brother James Logan, William Penn's agent. One of the books, Jean Pecquet's <span class="italic">Experimenta nova anatomica</span> (Paris, 1651), was first owned by Thomas Vaughan, the flyleaf bearing his signature and the motto <i>Deo duce: comite natura</i>, with the date 1652, which presumably represents the date on which Thomas acquired this work. On page 107 there is a marginal note in Henry's hand concerning the cause and cure of fever and dropsy, signed &#145;H:V:S&#146;. The form of signature suggests that Henry owned, or had access to, and felt free to write in, this book while he was still thinking of himself as Silurist (a native of the district anciently inhabited by the Silures), since books of a later date are signed simply &#145;Vaughan&#146;. Nicholas Fonteyn's treatise on paediatric medicine <span class="italic">Commentarius in Sebastianum Austrium: de puerorum morbis</span> carries the autograph signature and motto &#145;<i>Henr: Vaughan Siluris</i>. 1654. <i>Salus mea ex Agno</i>&#146;. The earliest work which bears both the signature &#145;Vaughan&#146; and the date of acquisition was published in 1669, and acquired by Vaughan in 1676. The collection shows that he began to buy medical books at least as early as 1654 and continued to do so until 1682. No book signed merely &#145;Vaughan&#146; has any religious motto in his hand.<br>
<br>Aubrey thought of Vaughan as taking a strong and informed interest in natural history; on 27 November 1675 he wrote to Anthony Wood that he was sending to his cousin Vaughan for the &#145;Naturall History&#146; of Brecknockshire and of &#145;other circumjacent counties: no man fitter&#146;  (Hutchinson, 212). This request was in connection with a natural history of England and Wales projected by Dr Robert Plott, keeper of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford. Vaughan replied to Aubrey on 9 December 1675, assuring him that he would take care to assist Plott &#145;with a short account of natures Dispensatorie heer&#146;, and requesting Aubrey to acquaint him &#145;with the method of his writinge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Henry Vaughan</span>, 692). As it was not until 1681 that Aubrey forwarded queries from Plott to Vaughan, it is scarcely surprising that nothing came of Vaughan's collaboration. However, Vaughan's marginalia to Simon Paulli's <span class="italic">Quadripartitum botanicum</span>, acquired for 12<i>s</i>. in 1682, suggest that his interest in natural history persisted. Vaughan did not complete this project, but roughly 400 plants are given their common English names; medicinal properties attributed to some are mentioned; and the note on <i>Agnus castis</i> suggests that Vaughan retained in his seventh decade that respect for Catholicism, evident in his translations, which he may well have learned as a child from his grandmother. He gives the English name as &#145;Park-leafs, or Chaste tree&#146;, adding the note &#145;A kind of withie, of which the most holy monks &amp; nuns make them girdles&#146;  (p. 188).<h2>
<a name="Laterlife"></a>Later life</h2>After the death of his first wife Vaughan married her sister Elizabeth Wise (<i>b</i>. 1630). There were four children of the second marriage: Grisell, Lucy, Rachel, and Henry. It has been found surprising that a devout Anglican should have married his deceased wife's sister. The table of kindred and affinity would have made the validity of such a marriage challengeable; however, under the Commonwealth that document shared the fate of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, and the <span class="roman">Act for Marriages</span> of 1653 did not touch upon the prohibited degrees. The totally unworldly, devoted Anglican of <span class="italic">Silex scintillans</span> was a literary construct, only partially representative of Vaughan's non-literary self. It was natural enough that his dead wife's sister would help to care for his children. &#145;Isaac's Marriage&#146;, in the 1650 <span class="italic">Silex scintillans</span>, indicates that Vaughan had given thought to that biblical marriage which the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> held up as an example, and which involved marriage with a kinswoman &#145;in-law&#146;.<br>
<br>Vaughan's own statements indicate three significant periods of illness. In the preface to the 1655 <span class="italic">Silex scintillans</span>, he intimated that he was &#145;nigh unto death&#146; when he wrote the last poems in it  (<span class="italic">Complete Poems</span>, 143). The title-page of <span class="italic">Flores solitudinis</span> (1654) states that the pieces in it were &#145;Collected in his Sicknesse and Retirement&#146;, suggesting a protracted illness  (<span class="italic">Works of Henry Vaughan</span>, 211). In 1662 he wrote to the commissioners of account, who had been appointed to inquire into alleged misuse of tithes, &#145;I had not fayled to wayt upon you my selfe, if weaknes, &amp; other violent effects of a late feaver, had not resisted my real intentions&#146;  (Hutchinson, 199). Aubrey records that he wrote to Vaughan &#145;on that very day that the Pr[ince] of Orange came to London&#146;&#151;18 December 1688  (ibid., 209). On 25 March 1689 Vaughan wrote to Wood, &#145;I received a letter in the beginning of my sicknes from my Cousin John Awbrey about those inquiries you make now. &hellip; but it was my misfortune to continue so very weak and such a forlorn Clinic, that I could not to this day return him an answer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Henry Vaughan</span>, 694). Such glimpses of Vaughan as we have in his later years derive from two principal sources. First, a correspondence with Aubrey and Wood began with a letter of 15 June 1673 to Aubrey, giving an account of his and Thomas's publications, and ended with another, also to Aubrey, of 9 October 1694, on the subject of Welsh bards  (ibid., 689&#150;97). He refers to himself and Thomas as &#145;low &amp; forgotten things&#146; and expresses pleasure that their names are to be &#145;revived, &amp; shine in the Historie of the Universitie&#146;  (ibid., 689, 692). This correspondence is interesting, but not rich in biographical fact.<br>
<br>The other source is less happy, consisting of lawsuits indicating serious tensions within Vaughan's family, especially between the children of his first and second marriages. By an indenture dated 1689 Vaughan and his wife gave the Newton estate to his eldest son, with Thomas agreeing in return to pay &pound;100 each to the children of the second marriage, to allow his father &pound;30 a year for life, and his stepmother &pound;20 a year after his father's death. However, this affair was not concluded until 1694. Thomas did not make the agreed payments to the children of the second marriage, and alleged that his father and stepmother had &#145;in a most clandestine manner &hellip; taken away the said articles and indenture &hellip; and cut the signatures therefrom&#146;  (Hutchinson, 230). The matter was finally settled out of court and an agreement was reached which acknowledged Thomas's right to the estate. In 1693 Vaughan's daughter Catherine, whose hand had been burnt when she was an infant and who was lame, petitioned the justices of the great sessions to &#145;order her father to give her necessary maintenance&#146;  (ibid., 232). The judge of assize awarded her &pound;6 a year, but this appears not to have been paid, and Catherine received no support from the local magistrates. In a second petition to the next meeting of the great sessions she complained that she had received only 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. This occasioned a bitter letter from Vaughan to the judge who had made the award: &#145;your Lordship will give me leave to tell you that among heathens noe parents were ever compelled to maintain or relieve disobedient &amp; rebellious children, that both despise and vilifie their parents&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Henry Vaughan</span>, 699). The case seems to have been concluded by the local magistrates ordering a quarterly payment of 15<i>s</i>. At some time after the house at Newton was conveyed to his son Thomas in 1689, Vaughan and Elizabeth moved to a cottage in Sgethrog; its lintel-stone may be seen at the foot of Vaughan's gravestone. On it are inscribed the initials H<sup>V</sup>E over the date 1689; however, it is unclear when they actually vacated Newton.<br>
<br>There is no portrait of Vaughan, and no description of his appearance. Aubrey wrote that he was &#145;ingeniose, but prowd and humorous&#146;, that is, capricious or moody  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 303). This seems an apt description of Thomas Vaughan. The brothers may have been identical twins. Thomas Powell wrote of them, &#145;Not only your <i>faces</i>, but your <i>wits</i> are <i>twins</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Poems</span>, 67), and the second half of this seems apt enough. Stevie Davies considers the fact of Vaughan's twinship central to understanding of his personality and, by extension, his work.<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>The cause of Vaughan's death is unknown; he died in Brecknockshire in 1695, on 23 April, like Shakespeare before him, and Wordsworth after him. His wife survived him. He died intestate, and his possessions were valued at &pound;49 4<i>s</i>.: not much, but almost ten times what his father's had been at his death in 1658. Vaughan's gravestone, of unusual size and thickness, may still be seen in St Bridget's churchyard, Llansanffraid. Vaughan was buried not inside the church, as was fairly usual for gentlemen at that time, but in the churchyard, a statement of humility perhaps. At the top is written in Latin: &#145;Henry Vaughan, Silurist, Doctor of Medicine. He died on April 23 in the year of our salvation 1695 and in the 73rd year of his age.&#146; (Vaughan's age at death, as recorded on his gravestone, is at odds with the now generally accepted year of his birth.) Immediately below is the family's coat of arms: a statement of claim to gentlemanly status. Below that is written in Latin: &#145;What he wished on his tomb: unprofitable servant, greatest of sinners, here I lie; glory to God; may He have mercy.&#146; The combination of worldliness and humility is not merely conventional: memorials to the gentry of that time were apt to celebrate the virtues of class, such as free-handed hospitality, rather than Christianity's more rigorous virtues.<br>
<br>The gravestone, a kind of retrospective, sums Vaughan up as gentleman, Silurist, medical man, and Christian. Arguably he came at last to present himself under two principal aspects, of gentleman and of Christian, which are, as George Herbert clearly saw when he wrote &#145;Church Monuments&#146;, in some tension with one another.<br>
<br>Vaughan anticipates the Romantics in expressing a loving appreciation of the natural world. His sense of the sacredness of nature may be related to his reading in the hermetic books. These speak of a god transcendent, hidden, utterly beyond all sense and thought; but also of a god nearer than was the Lord in the garden of Eden, a god moreover whose presence is uninterrupted. Of all paradoxes, this is the most favoured by the hermetic writers. To the author of the fifth <i>libellus</i>, as to Henry Vaughan, the Lord manifested himself &#145;ungrudgingly through all the universe&#146;; he &#145;beheld God's image with his eyes, and laid hold on it with his hands&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hermetica</span>, ed. W. Scott, 4 vols., 1924&#150;36, 1.159). Since he creates by emanation, there is no sharp distinction between God and his universe. No place is especially sacred, because every place is sacred; to use Vaughan's words, God is &#145;in all things, though invisibly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Poems</span>, 242), and &#145;<i>each bush</i> / And <i>oak</i> doth know I AM&#146;  (ibid., 193). Such a viewpoint had its appeal for a mid-century Anglican who had lost his accustomed liturgy and his former places of worship. Vaughan's devotion to the God who manifested himself ungrudgingly through the universe surely marks a new phase of religious sensibility in seventeenth-century England.<br>
<br>As Vaughan's nineteenth-century editors and his twentieth-century biographer were clergymen, it is not surprising that they found him most interesting as a religious poet. <span class="italic">Silex scintillans</span> is indeed as great a sequence of religious lyrics as we have. However, discussion of Vaughan, for some considerable time after the appearance of Hutchinson's <span class="italic">Life</span> in 1947, tacitly accepted his view that &#145;We can admire his loyalty to his ideals in Church and State, and yet regret that the calm and remote air of his divine poems and devotional pieces should so often be ruffled by these political and ecclesiastical outbursts&#146;  (Hutchinson, 109). Since then, however, criticism has been increasingly focused on Vaughan's religio-political intentions (religion and politics were scarcely separable), which can be descried even in poems in which polemical intent is not obvious. The founding, in the year of the tercentenary of his death, of a society devoted to the study and celebration of his work and that of his brother has resulted in an increase of critical attention. This is a welcome development; the ratio of work, during the second half of the twentieth century, on Marvell and Herbert to that on Vaughan is unjustified. While much interesting criticism has sharpened our sense of Vaughan as a poet of political purpose, it does not follow that his understanding of political processes was superior. What then about his work makes it worthy of continued attention?<br>
<br>As one of the defeated, Vaughan wore his rue with a difference, in two senses. His finest lyrics challenge the best in their age; his achievements in rhythm have no peer until Hopkins; and if others had a better understanding of political process, none of his contemporaries understood better than he the relatedness of all living things and their relationship to what we call the inanimate world. He understood the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>'s most important passage on the theology of nature, <span class="roman">Romans</span> 8: 19&#150;22, as modern theologians do. What the science of his time could not prove, the intuition of the poet could express. Jurgen Moltmann understood well when he prefaced his <span class="italic">God in Creation</span> with Vaughan's poem &#145;The Book&#146;, which asserts the unity of creation and the value of all creatures. Victorian criticism of the metaphysicals may often seem dated, but it was astute of H. C. Beeching, introducing E. K. Chambers's edition of Vaughan's poems in 1896, to sense the force of an observation first made of Wordsworth and say that Vaughan too &#145;makes us feel that Nature is not a mere collection of phenomena, but infuses into her least approach some sense of her mysterious whole&#146;. At the beginning of the twenty-first century some students of &#145;environmental literature&#146; consider it anachronistic to think of &#145;ecological consciousness&#146; as anything but a post-Darwinian phenomenon. Closer study of Vaughan, as of Milton, his greatest contemporary on the other side of the political divide, might convince them otherwise.<br>
