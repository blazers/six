<span class="headword">Wolfe,  Humbert</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Umberto Wolff]</span>  (1885&#150;1940), <span class="occ">poet and civil servant</span>, was born of Jewish parents in the via Fatebenefratelli, Milan, on 5 January 1885. He was the younger son and third of the five children of Martin Wolff (1845&#150;1894), of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and his wife, Consola (1859&#150;1926), daughter of Vita (Haim) and Orsola Terracini of Genoa. That same year Martin Wolff became a partner in a Bradford wool business, obtaining British nationality with his children in 1891. Umberto was educated at Bradford grammar school, and became a scholar of Wadham College, Oxford, where he obtained a second class in classical moderations (1905) and a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1907).<br>
<br>In 1908 Wolff entered the Board of Trade as senior clerk in the harbour department, where his speed and brilliance of mind caught the attention of William (later Lord) Beveridge who in 1912 enticed him into the newly created department of labour exchanges and unemployment insurance. With the outbreak of war he became secretary to the munitions of war committee, and from 1915 to 1918 was controller of labour regulation in the newly formed Ministry of Munitions, serving under Lloyd George (whose favour he briefly enjoyed and mysteriously lost) and subsequently under Winston Churchill. According to the &#145;Introduction&#146; to the <span class="italic">History of the Ministry of Munitions</span>, Wolfe's account in <span class="italic">Labour Supply and Regulation</span> (1923) &#145;[has] not been superseded&#146;  (Hazlehurst, 9). His nationality was called into question when he was appointed CBE in 1918 for his contribution to the war, described later by Lord Beveridge as &#145;of first-rate importance&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 9 Jan 1940). Churchill loyally, but erroneously, tried to demonstrate that Wolff's father was a citizen of Schleswig-Holstein; Wolff chose this moment to change his name to Humbert Wolfe.<br>
<br>After the armistice Wolfe reverted to employment exchanges, incorporated in the new Ministry of Labour. From 1920, as head of the general department and a principal assistant secretary, he was responsible for international labour questions. Until 1931 he was a regular member of the British empire delegation to meetings of the International Labour Organization (ILO) in Geneva, where his eloquence, his skill as a negotiator in explosive situations, and his witty interventions in French and English earned him respect and often affection. But he never achieved his ambition of becoming secretary-general of the League of Nations or director of the ILO. At home he strove to humanize labour exchanges, and to bring able men and (preferably attractive) women from varied backgrounds into the administrative class of the ministry. He was appointed CB in 1925. In 1931 Wolfe became director of services and establishments in the ministry, and from 1934 until 1938 he headed the department of employment and training, where his methods proved so effective that other ministries copied them and often turned to his department to fill critical vacancies. In March 1938 he was appointed deputy secretary to the ministry.<br>
<br>Wolfe's wisdom and experience were invaluable, his energy and commitment boundless, in identifying and largely resolving the problems of manpower and the needs of home defence raised by the threat of impending war. High blood pressure, advanced arteriosclerosis, and sheer exhaustion took their toll, as he knew they would, and he died at his home, 75 Eccleston Square, London, on his birthday, 5 January 1940. The funeral took place on 11 January at St Martin-in-the-Fields. His grave, marked only by a hawthorn tree at his own request, is in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
<br>Wolfe was baptized into the Church of England in 1908, and married on 29 March 1910 his childhood sweetheart, Jessie Chalmers Graham (1883&#150;1956), elder daughter of Joseph Chalmers Graham, rector of the Knox Institute, Haddington, East Lothian. They had one daughter, Ann. After his long-standing love affair with the successful young novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58791/', "Pamela Frankau (1908&#150;1967)")</script>, Wolfe and his wife were legally separated in 1938.<br>
<br>Wolfe's was a many-sided, even chameleon-like personality. Ambition coupled with a superabundance of nervous and intellectual energy enabled him to pursue with equal ardour a career, a lively social life, and the writing, production, and editing in the space of twenty years of more than forty books of verse and prose, in addition to innumerable reviews in newspapers and periodicals.<br>
<br>Wolfe's many voices&#151;ironic, lyrical, satirical, romantic&#151;displayed his mastery of poetic technique. Though the core of his writing was autobiographical, his compulsion to simultaneous self-revelation and concealment found expression in the use of the third person in the prose accounts of his early childhood, <span class="italic">Now a Stranger</span> (1933), and of his Oxford days, <span class="italic">The Upward Anguish</span> (1938). In the chronological sequence of prose sketches, <span class="italic">Portraits by Inference</span> (1934), and his travel stories, <span class="italic">P.L.M.</span> (1936), Wolfe plays the observer in the wings but effectively occupies centre stage. A number of poetic works were indirectly or covertly autobiographical: <span class="italic">Humoresque</span> (1926), a harlequinade about lost love, a theme taken up and developed in the dramatic fantasy <span class="italic">Reverie of Policeman</span> (1933) and the unpublished verse play &#145;The Publicist&#146; (1927), in which the writer, both author and character, comes to terms with his own tangled life; and <span class="italic">The Uncelestial City</span> (1930), a dying judge's review of his past, which borrows heavily from Wolfe's own life.<br>
<br>Exclusively satirical writings were <span class="italic">News of the Devil</span> (1926), which pilloried Fleet Street, <span class="italic">Don J. Ewan</span> (1937), in which an American newspaper magnate scourged the modern world in Byronic stanzas, and the slighter volumes <span class="italic">Lampoons</span> (1925), <span class="italic">ABC of the Theatre</span> (1932), <span class="italic">Stings and Wings</span> (1935), and <span class="italic">Truffle Eater</span> (1933), an anti-Nazi pastiche of <span class="italic">Struwwelpeter</span>.<br>
<br>Volumes of occasional verse included <span class="italic">London Sonnets</span> (1920), <span class="italic">Shylock Reasons with Mr. Chesterton</span> (1920), <span class="italic">The Unknown Goddess</span> (1925), <span class="italic">This Blind Rose</span> (1928), <span class="italic">Snow</span> (1931), and <span class="italic">Out of Great Tribulation</span> (1939). Some had a central theme, as in the sonnet sequence <span class="italic">The Fourth of August</span> (1935), and notably the winners and losers in <span class="italic">Requiem</span> (1927) and the re-enactment of Christ's passion under Nazi tyranny in <span class="italic">X at Oberammergau</span> (1935). Wolfe's daughter was the focus and inspiration for <span class="italic">Kensington Gardens</span> (1924), <span class="italic">Cursory Rhymes</span> (1926), <span class="italic">Kensington Gardens in War-Time</span> (1940), and the cautionary tales of <span class="italic">Circular Saws</span> (1923).<br>
<br>Wolfe wrote as critic and interpreter in <span class="italic">Dialogues and Monologues</span> (1928), <span class="italic">Notes on English Verse Satire</span> (1929), <span class="italic">Tennyson</span> (1930), <span class="italic">George Moore</span> (1931), <span class="italic">Signpost to Poetry</span> (1931), <span class="italic">Romantic and Unromantic Poetry</span> (1933), and <span class="italic">Ronsard and French Romantic Poetry</span> (1934). His translations ranged from the Greek anthology&#151;<span class="italic">Others Abide</span> (1928) and <span class="italic">Homage to Meleager</span> (1930)&#151;to <span class="italic">Portrait of Heine</span> (1930), Edmond Fleg's <span class="italic">Wall of Weeping</span> (1929), Ronsard's <span class="italic">Sonnets Pour H&eacute;l&egrave;ne</span> (1934), <span class="italic">Cyrano de Bergerac</span> (1937), and a version of a romantic comedy by Eugene Heltai, <span class="italic">The Silent Knight</span> (1937).<br>
<br>He edited a number of collections and anthologies: <span class="italic">Augustan Books of English Poetry</span> (1926&#150;7), <span class="italic">A Winter Miscellany</span> (1930), <span class="italic">The Pilgrim's Way</span> (1936), <span class="italic">Personalities</span> (1936)&#151;selections from A. A. Baumann&#151;and wrote introductions to other editions: <span class="italic">The Poetical Works of Robert Herrick</span> (1928), <span class="italic">Selected Poems by Swinburne</span> (1928), and <span class="italic">The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span> (1933).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Requiem</span> made Wolfe famous, and his verse remained popular despite attacks from the critics, but his posthumous eclipse thanks to the war and changing literary fashion was undeserved. While he consistently and unashamedly proclaimed his faith in beauty, goodness, and the power of poetry to transform the world, at the heart of his genius lay a satiric stance, and the ability to sum up an event or a person in a pungent phrase or a couplet, and in this he bears comparison with Herrick, Dryden, and Pope as much as with Heine.<br>
