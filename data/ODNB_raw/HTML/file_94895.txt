<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Millar,  George Reid</span>  (1910&#150;2005), <span class="occ">special operations officer, author, and farmer</span>, was born on 19 September 1910 at Boghall, Baldernock, Stirlingshire, the younger son (there was no daughter) of Thomas Andrew Millar (<i>d</i>. 1921/2), architect, and his wife, Mary Reid, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Morton (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1938). As a small boy he shared his cot with the family Airedale, which had to be put down in 1917 as there was no meat to spare for it; this did not make him pro-German. He went from Loretto School, which he rather disliked, to St John's College, Cambridge, where he read architecture and enjoyed himself. He tried work as an architect, between 1930 and 1932, but soon gave it up for journalism. The <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> sent him to investigate the wreck of the <i>Lusitania</i>, which led to a lifelong fascination with the sea. In 1934 he moved on to the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, and once scooped the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, which captured him with a larger salary. He was unusually good-looking, and made his first marriage on 2 December 1937 to Annette Rose Forsyth, the 25-year-old daughter of Brigadier-General Clifton Inglis Stockwell, and the former wife of Michael Noel Forsyth; she abandoned her first husband for him. She joined him in Paris when he became one of the <span class="italic">Express</span>'s Paris correspondents shortly before the outbreak of war in 1939. By June 1940 he was the only one left, and made a hazardous escape from the advancing German forces by motor car south-westwards, managing to get out to England just in time. She had been driving an ambulance at the front, and escaped separately.<br>
<br>Millar at once threw up his profession to join the army, and was soon commissioned into the rifle brigade and sent to north Africa. In the confused fighting round Gazala in June 1942 his platoon got separated from the 1st battalion and he was taken prisoner, lightly wounded. He was packed off to a prisoner-of-war camp in southern Italy, where he soon ran a black market in food with the local peasantry. When this was discovered he was moved to a punishment camp near Genoa, from which he was abruptly transferred to Germany in September 1943. He escaped from the train, made friends with some French forced labourers, got into France, stumbled on a British escape line, and crossed the Pyrenees with difficulty. On the way he met a Special Operations Executive (SOE) organizer, Richard Heslop, who refused to recruit him, but mentioned his name to his SOE commander. SOE interviewed and recruited him when he reached London. During his escape, which earned him a military cross, he had been buoyed up by thoughts of rejoining his wife; she had not waited for him.<br>
<br>Millar plunged into SOE training and, on the rebound, into a new love affair, with Isabel Beatriz Hardwell, the wife of Charles George Hardwell, and daughter of Montagu Bentley Talbot Paske-Smith, diplomat, and his Spanish wife. He was parachuted into eastern France on the night of 1&#150;2 June 1944, a few days before the Normandy landings, to set up a new sabotage circuit called Chancellor; his personal codename was Emile. He went to work in the Ourcq valley, north of Besan&ccedil;on, where Georges Molle, the leading local poacher, proved a tower of strength to him. From a very late start, he was able to assemble groups of saboteurs devoted to him, whom he made skilled at their tasks and kept supplied with explosives. They disrupted traffic on the local railway, which was of some strategic importance to the Germans, and made a substantial distraction of German effort away from the main fighting fronts, at a price in casualties. His powers of leadership and sheer charm were such that, fifty years later, elderly women who had worked for him as teenage couriers would lay hand on heart and cry &#145;Ah! Emile!&#146; if his codename was mentioned. He was appointed to the DSO by the British and to the L&eacute;gion d'honneur by the French, who also awarded him a Croix de Guerre.<br>
<br>After the liberation of France Millar put an account of his escape into a book, <span class="italic">Horned Pigeon</span> (1946), and of his SOE adventures into another, <span class="italic">Maquis</span> (1945). He wrote them fast, but well, and secured clearance for their publication. The latter sold extensively: it gives a matchless account of how to live hour by hour, never knowing whether you will see the next through. De Gaulle told him in a private interview that his was the best account of life in the maquis, though he could not say so in public.<br>
<br>Millar divorced his first wife, and on 11 May 1946 married Isabel as soon as she was free of her first husband. After a protracted honeymoon sailing round the Mediterranean, they leased a farm of 1500 acres in west Dorset, where he settled down to breed cattle, hunt, shoot, and write. The best of several travel books were <span class="italic">Isabel and the Sea</span> (1948), on their honeymoon, and <span class="italic">Oyster River</span> (1963), on SOE's sea link between Cornwall and Brittany. He also wrote <span class="italic">Road to Resistance</span> (1979), a memoir of his war years. In 1989 Isabel emerged unconscious from a road accident, from which she died in 1990 without ever having recognized him again. He gave up the farm, and moved to Uploders Place, a house near Bridport, where Venetia Ross-Skinner looked after him as he went blind and old age crept up on his still undaunted spirit. He died at Warmwell House, Dorchester, on 15 January 2005, of bronchopneumonia. Venetia Ross-Skinner arranged an annual prize in his memory at Bridport literary festival. He had no children.<br>
