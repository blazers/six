<span class="headword">Wheare,  Diagory <span class="st"> [Degory]</span></span>  (1573&#150;1647), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born in Berry Court, Jacobstow, Cornwall. Little is known of his family. In his youth he frequented the Cornish puritan circle of Sir Anthony Rous of Halton St Dominick, with whose fourth son, Francis Rous, he formed a lifelong friendship. After his father's death in 1585, the one-year-old John Pym joined the Rous establishment when his mother became Sir Anthony's second wife. Wheare matriculated with Francis Rous at Broadgates Hall, Oxford (later Pembroke College), on 6 July 1593, graduated BA in 1597 and proceeded MA in 1600. In 1599 Pym became a student at Broadgates, and Wheare acted as his tutor. They remained in close touch, as shown by their correspondence and Wheare's signature on a 1614 deed placing Pym's estates in trust.<br>
<br>From 1602 to 1608 Wheare was a fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, resigning to become travelling companion to Grey Brydges, fifth Baron Chandos, a favourite of James I. After returning with Brydges from the Netherlands in 1610 he remained in Chandos's household at Sudeley Castle until the baron's death in 1621. He then took up residence in Gloucester Hall, Oxford (later incorporated in Worcester College), where he became principal in 1626. The hall flourished under his firm administration, and the students were urged to apply themselves to useful knowledge befitting a gentleman.<br>
<br>Throughout his life at Oxford Wheare was an indefatigable contributor of Latin poems to collections issued by the university to mark special occasions such as the accession of James I in 1603, the return of the future Charles I from Spain in 1623, the birth of the future James II in 1633, and Charles I's return from Scotland in 1641. He published tributes to his patron, the celebrated antiquary William Camden, in <span class="italic">Pietas erga benefactores</span> (1628) and <span class="italic">Parentatio historica</span> and an account of Gloucester Hall in 1630.<br>
<br>On 19 November 1621 Wheare's friend at Gloucester Hall, the mathematician Thomas Allen, recommended him to Camden when the latter was in the process of endowing the first chair in history at Oxford. He described Wheare as &#145;a man who, besides his abilities of learning sufficient for such a place, is known to be of good experience (having sometimes travelled), and of very honest and discreet conversation&#146;  (Camden, 315). The benefaction was accepted by the university in May 1622, the donor specifying that he wished Wheare to lecture on the epitome of Roman history by Lucius Annaeus Florus. In a letter dated 6 January 1623 Camden stated that the new professor<blockquote>should read a civil history, and therein make such observations as might bee most usefull and profitable for the younger students of the University, to direct and instruct them in the knowledge and use of history, antiquity, and times past. (Jones, 175)</blockquote>For more than twenty years after he began lecturing in 1623 Wheare obeyed Camden's instructions to develop themes from sections of Florus. He deposited the Latin manuscript of many of his lectures in the Bodleian Library in 1645. Occasionally he drew parallels with modern times, and suggested how Roman examples might be followed by statesmen, but, despite his contact with Rous and Pym, he made no specific allusions to contemporary political troubles in Britain. His reputation rests less upon these lectures than upon his Latin manual on how to read and profit from history, which he composed and published at the beginning of his tenure, and revised and expanded in subsequent editions. Two titles were used: <span class="italic">De ratione et methodo legendi historias dissertatio</span> (1623, 1625, 1628) and <span class="italic">Relectiones hyemales de ratione et methodo legendi utrasque historias civiles et ecclesiasticas</span> (1637, 1662, 1684). The 1662 edition contained many additions by Nicholas Horseman. Further changes and additions were made in an English translation by the tory pamphleteer Edmund Bohun, <span class="italic">The Method and Order of Reading both Civil and Ecclesiastical Histories</span> (1685, 1694, 1698, 1710). A later incumbent of the Camden chair, Henry Dodwell, added a preface to the 1694 English version entitled &#145;An invitation to gentlemen to acquaint themselves with ancient history&#146;.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Method and Order</span> was one of the best and last examples of the Renaissance <i>ars historica</i>. This popular genre was based on <i>obiter dicta</i> on the nature and purpose of history pronounced in classical antiquity and applied by historians then and since. Its practitioners glossed not only the ancient texts but also each other's remarks about them. History was assumed to have both a practical and a moral application indicated by the phrase attributed to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, &#145;history is philosophy teaching by examples&#146;. The European authors of <i>artes historicae</i> differed as to whether the readers should first study the precepts exemplified by history before approaching the subject matter or whether these precepts should be directly inferred from historical example. It was Wheare's achievement to see both sides of this issue, and to attempt to reconcile them. In so doing he displayed remarkable erudition in both classical and Renaissance historians. He was less informed about medieval historians, but this weakness was compensated for by the additions of Horseman and Bohun.<br>
<br>In 1643 Wheare endeavoured to have his son Charles (<i>b</i>. 1613) endorsed as his successor in the Camden chair. He does not seem to have played any part in politics at Oxford during the civil war, and was still Camden professor and principal of Gloucester Hall when he died in Oxford on 1 August 1647, leaving a widow and four sons. He was buried in Exeter College chapel. Charles Wheare ran as a candidate for the chair, but was not elected.<br>
