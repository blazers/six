<span class="headword">Pite,  Arthur Beresford</span>  (1861&#150;1934), <span class="occ">architect and educator</span>, was born on 2 September 1861 at 9 South Terrace, Grosvenor Park, Walworth, Surrey, the second son of Alfred Robert Pite (1832&#150;1911), architect, and his wife, Hephzibah Starkey, and was baptized on 27 February 1862 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London.<br>
<br>For Pite architecture was an &#145;ancestral&#146; calling, his earliest memories being of the distinctive aroma of tracing paper in his father's London office. His father's work, at the time of his birth and later, in partnership with W. G. Habershon, consisted mainly of churches and domestic buildings, including work for various London estates. Before his marriage, however, in the late 1850s, he had worked in Brazil as an architect to the ambitious Dom Pedro Railway project. Arthur's education began in London at King's College School, and the National Art Training School in South Kensington. From 1876 to 1881 he was articled in the Cardiff office of what was at first Habershon Pite and Fawckner, his father leaving the partnership in 1878. His architectural studies continued meanwhile at University College (where he received the Donaldson medal in 1879) and the Architectural Association in London. He came to the notice of the profession at an early age due to his controversial and brilliantly accomplished Gothic design for a West End club house&#151;apparently intended as a &#145;humorous travesty&#146; of its subject  (W. A. Pite, 131)&#151;with which, in March 1882, he won the Soane medallion of the Royal Institute of British Architects. He then travelled for a year in France and Germany, with his architect brother William, who was Architectural Association travelling student, later to find renown as the architect of King's College Hospital, Denmark Hill, London.<br>
<br>The club house design came at the end of a period when Gothic&#151;particularly in the work of George Edmund Street, William Burges, and E. W. Godwin&#151;had begun seriously to challenge classicism as the style for civic buildings. Pite's design may, indeed, have been intended to pay homage to Burges, who died while he was preparing it. If Burges's Cardiff Castle&#151;the towers of which Pite would have seen rising while articled in that city&#151;might be said to have given the club house its architectural character, it also gave the young and spiritually minded Pite a deeper sense of a &#145;golden city&#146;, which he felt it should be the ambition of every architect to help bring into being. Significantly, he attached to his club house design the Spanish motto &#145;El Dorado, yo h&eacute; trovado&#146; (&#145;I have found the Golden City&#146;). In 1884 he worked briefly as a draughtsman for <span class="italic">The Builder</span> magazine, responsible for a series of brilliant illustrations at a time when its new editor, H. H. Statham, was trying to inject new energy and vision into the paper's coverage of architectural topics.<br>
<br>Pite's independent buildings were relatively few. From 1883 (the year he was also admitted as a student to the Royal Academy) to 1897 he was first improver, and then managing clerk, in the office of the leading London architect John Belcher, his finest contributions of this period being to the Institute of Chartered Accountants building in the City of London (1888&#150;93), a key design in the revival of a more sophisticated version of classicism. With Belcher he early became involved with the Art-Workers' Guild (founded in 1884), later becoming its master. After 1900 much of Pite's time was spent teaching, following an invitation from his friend, and founder of the Art-Workers' Guild, W. R. Lethaby, to become the first professor of architecture at the newly formed Royal College of Art, a post he held until 1923. He was also architectural director of a pioneering educational project bringing together architects, artists, and builders, at the London county council's School of Building in Brixton, and, from 1909 to 1931, a member of the University of Cambridge board of architectural studies.<br>
<br>The relative security he obtained from teaching enabled Pite to choose his own architectural projects carefully, and he appeared to choose those which provided an opportunity to establish new models for a variety of different building types. He was regarded in his day as experimental and avant-garde, seeming to ignore conventional stylistic boundaries. H. S. Goodhart-Rendel said that &#145;What was good enough for the best people at any time &hellip; seems always to have been something of which he had tired ten years before&#146;  (W. A. Pite, 125). As a devout Christian he particularly favoured the development of new forms in connection with church buildings, incorporating these later in his secular buildings. Sometimes his visionary compositions, in particular his proposal for a &#145;tower of healing&#146; of 1904, closely combined secular with sacred imagery.<br>
<br>The finest of Pite's churches is Christ Church, Brixton Road, London (1896&#150;1902). It represents an early example of a return to Byzantine sources, incorporating innovations such as a studious &#145;layering&#146; of the walls, using different intensities of brick polychromy. With Lethaby he attempted a much larger version of a Byzantine church in an unsuccessful entry for the 1902 competition for a new Anglican cathedral at Liverpool. An idiosyncratic Wesleyan church at Gospel Oak (1899; dem.) and a chancel added to the eighteenth-century church of Holy Trinity, Clapham Common (1905), both in London, reveal a later affection for the work of Sir Christopher Wren&#151;which was not uncommon among younger English architects at this time. Outside England, Pite was involved in work which included missionary buildings in Palestine, and a notable cathedral in Kampala, Uganda (1911&#150;13).<br>
<br>Pite was a lover of Dickens and appreciated his vision of London, and it was as architect to the Howard de Walden estate in St Marylebone that he came closest to realizing his vision of a &#145;golden city&#146;. Pite produced for the estate a fine series of houses (including 82 Mortimer Street, 1893, with its Michelangelesque sculpture), apartment blocks, a hostel, a church house, medical buildings, a restaurant (Pagani's), a warehouse, business premises, and a day school. Not far from St Marylebone stands the building considered by many to be Pite's masterpiece: built in 1906&#150;8, the London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow insurance offices on Euston Square. Like some of the buildings on the estate, these offices show the influence of Michelangelo, but the earlier literal references to the sculpture of the Medici tombs were superseded here by a plastic manipulation of load-bearing masonry, with little applied decoration. Another contemporary example of the influence of Michelangelo can be seen in the garden architecture of Burton Manor in Cheshire (1909&#150;13). Pite's sense of place and attention to history are shown in the way in which the insurance offices echo the Greek revival style of nearby important early nineteenth-century structures, such as St Pancras Church and Euston Arch. In the same way, his ebullient fa&ccedil;ade for the Burlington Arcade on Piccadilly (1930&#150;31) seems designed to echo the very different commercial and cultural exuberance of that thoroughfare. In the Euston building, and later ones such as the primitive, &#145;aboriginal&#146; branch library in Thornhill Square, Islington, Pite's architecture might be compared with that of his Slovenian contemporary Joze Plecnik.<br>
<br>On 20 April 1887 Pite married Mary Kilvinton Mowll (<i>d</i>. 1905) at Whitfield in Kent. In private he was reserved and meditative. Only in his lectures and other public utterances was his dry wit given free rein. He made light of his own pinched features in one of his early competition pseudonyms, Chichevache, Chaucers's thin-faced and voracious monster. Through his drawing, teaching, and lecturing he attracted a number of young admirers, some of whom were themselves to be influential in later years, although none ever adopted anything like a &#145;Pite style&#146;. They included Charles Holden, A. E. Richardson, H. S. Goodhart-Rendel, William Curtis Green, and H. Berry Webber. It was Richardson who compared Pite, near the end of his life, to the Roman twin-faced god &#145;Janus bifrons&#146;, for his ability to look with equal passion into the past and the future  (W. A. Pite, 134). Pite died at home, at 22 Manor Way, Beckenham, Kent, on 27 November 1934, and was buried in Norwood cemetery in south London on 30 November.<br>
