<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Alison, Sir  Archibald</span>, second baronet  (1826&#150;1907), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Edinburgh on 21 January 1826, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/349/', "Sir Archibald Alison, first baronet (1792&#150;1867)")</script>, historian, and his wife, Elizabeth Glencairn (1799&#150;1873), youngest daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel William Tytler. In 1835 Possil House, near Glasgow, became the family home. The father educated his son privately, until he went to Glasgow University. There, at the age of fifteen, he gained the first prize for an English essay on Sulla, and reviewed Thierry's <span class="italic">History of the Gauls</span> in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span>. Between Alison and his father there was always a very close relationship. They shared the same tastes, and the son replied in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> (May 1850) to the criticisms in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> on the later volumes of his father's <span class="italic">History of Europe</span>.<br>
<br>On 3 November 1846 Alison was commissioned ensign in the 72nd foot (later Seaforth Highlanders); he was promoted lieutenant on 11 September 1849, and joined the headquarters of the regiment in Barbados. Yellow fever was raging there, and his father had arranged for an exchange, but Alison refused to leave his regiment at such a time. He went with it to Nova Scotia in 1851, and came home with it in October 1854, having been promoted captain on 11 November 1853.<br>
<br>After some months at Malta the regiment went to the Crimea in May 1855 and, having taken part in the expedition to Kerch, was placed in the Highland brigade at the end of June. While serving with the regiment in the trenches before Sevastopol, Alison attracted the notice of Sir Colin Campbell by opportunely producing a sketch plan of the trenches, which he had drawn on an envelope, as well as by his coolness under fire. He was mentioned in dispatches and was made brevet major on 6 June 1856. On 19 December 1856 he left the 72nd for an unattached majority.<br>
<br>When Sir Colin Campbell left England at twenty-four hours' notice on 12 July 1857 to suppress the Indian mutiny, he took Alison with him as his military secretary, and his younger brother, Frederick, as his aide-de-camp. In the second relief of Lucknow both brothers were wounded, Archibald losing his left arm. He returned to duty early in 1858, but the stump became inflamed, and he was invalided home (10 March). He had been mentioned in dispatches, and was made brevet lieutenant-colonel and CB (28 February 1861). On his arrival in England he dined with Queen Victoria. He published &#145;Lord Clyde's campaign in India&#146; in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> (October 1858), and later other articles.<br>
<br>Alison was unemployed for the next four years. On 18 November 1858 he married Jane, daughter of James Black of Dalmonach, a Glasgow merchant. She died on 15 July 1909. Jane edited her father-in-law's autobiography, and was a woman of many gifts. They had two sons and four daughters. From 17 March 1862 to 19 October 1867 Alison was an assistant adjutant-general, first with the inspector-general of infantry at headquarters, and three years afterwards in the south-western district. He became brevet colonel on 17 March 1867, and succeeded his father as baronet in May 1867. On 1 October 1870 he was placed on the staff at Aldershot as assistant adjutant-general.<br>
<br>At the end of 1873 Alison went to the west coast of Africa in command of the British brigade in the Second Anglo-Asante War, with the local rank of brigadier-general. He took part in the battle of Amoaful, the capture of Bequah, the action at Ordahsu, and the capture of Kumasi. At Amoaful the enemy fire was very heavy, and the dense growth made direction difficult, but his staff were struck by his self-possession and the precision of his orders. When abscesses in his only hand made him nearly helpless, he bore his suffering without complaint. He was mentioned in dispatches, received the thanks of parliament, and was made KCB on 31 March 1874. After a few months at Aldershot, he went to Ireland as deputy adjutant-general on 17 October 1874, and was promoted major-general on 1 October 1877. After four months as commandant of the Staff College at Camberley, he was appointed deputy quartermaster-general for intelligence, and helped the headquarters staff to meet the Egyptian crisis of 1882.<br>
<br>On 6 July 1882 Alison left England to command a force which was assembled at Cyprus to secure the Suez Canal. The bombardment of Alexandria took place on the 11th, and Alison landed there on the 17th with two battalions which were soon reinforced. On the 24th he occupied Ramlah and, receiving instructions to &#145;keep Arabi Pasha constantly alarmed&#146;, made repeated demonstrations towards Kafr el Dauwar, especially on 5 August. Thus Arabi was led to expect that the British advance on Cairo would be from Alexandria, and not from Isma&#145;iliyyah, as was planned. In that advance Alison commanded the Highland brigade, the leading brigade of the 2nd (Hamley's) division in the storming of the trenches at Tell al-Kebir; Alison took a personal part, revolver in hand, in the confused fighting inside. After the surrender of Cairo he was sent to occupy Tanta with half a battalion of the Gordon Highlanders (17 September). He found there an Egyptian force disposed to resist, but by coolness and tact he induced them to surrender. He was mentioned in dispatches, received the thanks of parliament, and was promoted lieutenant-general for distinguished service on 18 November 1882. After Wolseley's departure Alison was in command of the British force in Egypt until 17 May 1883. On his return a sword of honour was presented to him by the citizens of Glasgow, with a tiara for Lady Alison.<br>
<br>Alison commanded the Aldershot division from 1 August 1883 until the end of 1888, except for part of 1885, when he acted as adjutant-general during Wolseley's absence in Egypt. He received the GCB on 21 June 1887, was promoted general on 20 February 1889, and retired on 12 January 1893.<br>
<br>He was given the colonelcy of the Essex regiment on 24 November 1896, and was transferred to his former regiment, the Seaforth Highlanders, on 30 March 1897. He was also honorary colonel of the 1st volunteer battalion of the Highland light infantry, and was honorary LLD of Cambridge, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. From 1889 to 1899 he was a member of the Indian council. Alison died at his London home, 93 Eaton Place, on 5 February 1907, and was buried at Dean cemetery, Edinburgh, four days later. He was characterized as a man who knew how to combine courtesy with insistence on duty.<br>
