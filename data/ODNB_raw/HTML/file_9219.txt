<span class="headword">Fawcett,  James</span>  (1751&#150;1831), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and university teacher</span>, was born in Leeds, and baptized at St Peter's on 4 July 1751, the son of Richard Fawcett (1703/4&#150;1783), vicar of St John's, Leeds (1768&#150;83). Suffering from rickets, he had a weakly constitution from an early age. Having been educated at Leeds grammar school, he matriculated from St John's College, Cambridge, at Michaelmas 1770, under John Chevallier. In January 1774 he graduated BA, as fifth senior optime, and won the first members' prize, while a senior bachelor, in 1776. In 1777 he took his MA degree, and during the same year he was elected fellow of his college on the foundation of Sir Marmaduke Constable.<br>
<br>Ordained deacon on 11 June 1775 and priest on 15 December 1776 Fawcett was appointed curate at his father's church in Leeds in 1776. He was Lady Margaret preacher in Cambridge from 1786 to 1819 and published his sermons in 1794. From 1791 to 1822 he also served as vicar of St Sepulchre's (or the Round Church), Cambridge. In 1785 he proceeded BD, and in 1795 he was chosen Norrisian professor of divinity. Although his sermons were praised as models of composition and orthodoxy he failed to draw large congregations. He was rendered ineffective as a lecturer to divinity students by:<blockquote>A certain thickness in his speech, an awkwardness of manner in a crowd, a want of energy, and an easiness of temper, little calculated to curb the sallies of a large assembly of young men constrained to sit out a lecture of an hour in length. (Hughes, viii&#150;ix)</blockquote>Fawcett chiefly lived in St John's until presented by the college in 1801 to the united rectories of Thursford and Great Snoring in Norfolk. He then divided his time between his parsonage and the university, being permitted to retain rooms in college on account of his lectures. In 1815 he vacated the Norrisian professorship in the vain hope of gaining the more lucrative Lady Margaret professorship. In 1822 he also resigned his vicarage in Cambridge and retired to his rectory in Norfolk. Unmarried, he died at Great Snoring on 10 April 1831, aged seventy-nine.<br>
