<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Murray,  Flora</span>  (1869&#150;1923), <span class="occ">physician and suffragette</span>, was born at Murraythwaite, in Dumfriesshire, on 8 May 1869, the fourth of five children of John Murray (1828&#150;1862), landowner and retired naval captain, and his wife, Grace Harriet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Graham (1838&#150;1923). Having attended schools in London and in Germany, Murray went to the London Hospital in Whitechapel in 1890 for a six-month course as a paying probationer nurse; then, having decided to do medicine, she entered the London School of Medicine for Women in 1897. She completed three years' study there before going north in 1900 to finish her degree course at Durham, gaining the MB BS in 1903. Immediately after qualifying she worked for 18 months as medical assistant in charge of female admissions at the Crichton Royal Institution, a large asylum in Dumfriesshire, which provided the material for her subsequent MD thesis, &#145;Asylum Organisation and Management&#146; (1905). She resigned her post there in December 1904 to become house surgeon at the Belgrave Hospital for Children, in London. In 1906 she moved to the Chelsea Hospital for Women as assistant anaesthetist and remained on the staff there until 1913.<br>
<br>Shortly after arriving in London, Murray began working for women's suffrage, first as a supporter of Millicent Fawcett's National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies and then as a member of Emmeline Pankhurst's Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). She became prominent in the militant movement, speaking at public meetings, joining in the 1911 census protest, and treating suffragettes injured in the large demonstrations. During this period she met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62050/', "Dr Louisa Garrett Anderson")</script>, a fellow WSPU member, with whom she formed a close friendship and working collaboration that would last for the rest of her life. In 1911 the two founded a small hospital, which opened in February 1912 as the Women's Hospital for Children, at 688 Harrow Road, London. Under the WSPU motto, &#145;Deeds, not Words&#146;, it provided not only much-needed health care to working-class families&#151;in the first eleven months over 2,500 children were seen in out-patients&#151;but also opportunities for its doctors to gain clinical experience, since few hospitals at the time offered resident jobs for women. At the same time Murray continued her wider suffrage work and became a vociferous campaigner against the practice of forcible feeding of suffragettes on hunger strike, citing her own findings in women whom she had treated after release from Holloway. Her actions attracted the attention of Home Office officials, who attempted&#151;unsuccessfully&#151;to discredit her.<br>
<br>When war broke out in 1914 Murray and Anderson decided that contributing to the medical services for the troops would demonstrate clearly that women were capable of doing their duty as citizens and as competent in treating casualties as their male colleagues. However, knowing from their days with the WSPU that any approach by them would be rejected by the authorities, they offered their services to the French, and within five weeks had formed and equipped a small group, the Women's Hospital Corps (WHC), to run an auxiliary hospital under the Croix Rouge Fran&ccedil;aise, in Paris, with Murray as doctor in charge. On 15 September 1914 the group left England for their new home in the H&ocirc;tel Claridge on the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es, the first women's unit to go abroad. Within forty-eight hours of their arrival the 100-bed hospital was overwhelmed by casualties, but the women coped, and gradually this French military hospital run by English women acquired a reputation for dealing efficiently with injured men, with survival rates as good as those of other hospitals around. When in late October the WHC offered to run another hospital near the channel coast, the hard-pressed British authorities&#151;in a rather surprising <i>volte-face</i>&#151;accepted immediately, agreeing to fund it. This second hospital, at the Ch&acirc;teau Mauricien in Wimereux, had sixty-five beds, and by the end of the year the entire corps was based there, because scarcity of heating fuel had forced the closure of the H&ocirc;tel Claridge.<br>
<br>Shortly after leaving Paris, however, Murray and Anderson learned that new hospital beds were being created in England, and having offered to run a unit there were invited to meet the director-general of Army Medical Services, Sir Alfred Keogh, who astonished them by suggesting that they set up an army hospital in London. They accepted, and the corps returned to England in January 1915. They were assigned large former workhouse buildings in Endell Street, Covent Garden, and their hospital would be known as the Endell Street Military Hospital. Murray was once again doctor in charge; her colleague Anderson was chief surgeon, the two of them acting as commanding officers, leading a carefully recruited female staff of around 180. Full responsibility for running the 573-bed hospital, however, fell to Murray, graded for the purposes of pay as lieutenant-colonel equivalent. Surviving accounts by members of the WHC and their patients describe a driven, rather austere woman, who had no difficulty in enforcing discipline among sometimes unruly male patients while striving tirelessly to make a success of the enterprise.<br>
<br>Even though Endell Street was under the patronage of Sir Alfred Keogh there was still considerable opposition to the hospital within the War Office, and the general assumption was that it would close within six months. In the event it ran for over four and a half years, during which time Murray's staff treated over 24,000 in-patients, and saw 26,000 more as out-patients. The hospital became widely known and praised, <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> declaring approvingly that &#145;the noble ladies who manage the Suffragette hospital in Endell Street &hellip; are men in the best sense of that word, and yet women in the best sense of that word also&#146;  (19 July 1916). At the same time, the campaign for women's suffrage continued at the hospital: Murray saw it her duty to educate her staff, particularly the younger orderlies, many of whom who had been too young to join the suffrage movement, through weekly teaching sessions about their future responsibilities as citizens when women finally got the vote. In August 1917 she and Anderson were both awarded the CBE for their war work.<br>
<br>Endell Street was decommissioned at the end of 1919 and closed in January 1920. Murray returned to private practice and to the Harrow Road hospital, now renamed the Roll of Honour Hospital. She continued campaigning for universal franchise and in 1921 became a founder member of Lady Rhondda's Six Point Group. The diary and scrapbook of press cuttings that she had kept throughout the war were turned into a book about the WHC (<span class="italic">Women as Army Surgeons: Being the History of the Women's Hospital Corps in Paris, Wimereux and Endell Street, September 1914&#150;October 1919</span>), published in 1920. The following year the expiry of the hospital's lease and lack of funds to start in new premises forced the closure of Harrow Road, and Murray retired with Anderson to their cottage, Paul End, in Penn, Buckinghamshire. She died in a nursing home in Hampstead, London, on 28 July 1923, shortly after an operation for large bowel cancer, and was buried in Holy Trinity churchyard, Penn.<br>
