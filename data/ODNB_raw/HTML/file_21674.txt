<span class="headword">Peacock,  George</span>  (1805&#150;1883), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Navy House, Exmouth, Devon, on 9 June 1805, the second son of Richard George Peacock and his wife, Elizabeth Sanders. His father, a former master in the navy, then a merchant shipowner, took the boy from Dawlish grammar school, aged thirteen, to be his apprentice. Having served in the Mediterranean and Brazil, rising gradually to command a ship on a voyage to the Pacific, in 1828 Peacock joined the navy as second master on the <i>Echo</i>, the first regularly commissioned steamship in the service, to survey the lower Thames. He was ordered to the West Indies in the <i>Winchester</i> in 1829, and was appointed acting master of the <i>Magnificent</i> in March 1831.<br>
<br>After exchanging to the <i>Hyacinth</i> he surveyed the harbour of San Juan de Nicaragua (San Juan del Norte) and suggested a route across the isthmus from San Juan to the Pacific. He also recommended Victor Cove (Colon) as the terminus of a railway across the isthmus of Panama. Fifty years later Comte Ferdinand de Lesseps acknowledged his debt to Peacock's survey in his own direction of the cutting of the Panama Canal  (<span class="italic">Western Times</span>, 23 June 1882).<br>
<br>In 1835, as master of the <i>Medea</i> in the Mediterranean, he surveyed the isthmus of Corinth, marked the line of a possible canal, and presented his chart and plans to King Otho of Greece. In 1882, when work on the Corinth Canal began, King George of Greece honoured Peacock with the royal order of the Redeemer.<br>
<br>As master of the <i>Andromache</i>, Peacock surveyed, buoyed, and beaconed the harbours of Charlottetown and Three Rivers, Prince Edward Island, in 1838. After applying unsuccessfully to be appointed to a ship going to the First Opium War, he &#145;became disgusted with the Royal Naval service &hellip; having been badly treated by the Admiralty generally <i>for want of influential political friends</i>&#146; (his italics) and on 14 February 1840, &#145;reluctantly and respectfully&#146; resigned his commission  (Lpool RO, Pea 3/4).<br>
<br>Offered a post by the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, Peacock superintended the building and equipment of the <i>Peru</i> and the <i>Chile</i>. In overall command of the expedition, he took them, the first steamships ever to navigate the Strait of Magellan, to the Pacific coast. From 1840 to 1846 he was the company's marine superintendent there, during which time he<blockquote>laid down Buoys&#151;erected Beacons&#151;built a Lighthouse&#151;surveyed Harbours&#151;opened and worked Coal-mines&#151;discovered new Guano-beds&#151;suggested Railways&#151;rendered valuable services occasionally to her Majesty's Cruisers&#151;and &hellip; in the face of a thousand unlooked for difficulties and perplexing annoyances, succeeded in establishing Steam Navigation under the Flag of England along the coast of Five Republics &hellip; from Chiloe to Panama; and brought from Valparaiso to Panama &hellip; the <i>first</i> regular Mails. (Peacock, 7)</blockquote>In 1848 Peacock became dock master, subsequently superintendent, of Southampton docks. In the same year he formed a company, Peacock and Buchan, for the manufacture of his patented anti-fouling paint for iron ships. He was able proudly to claim that numerous iron sailing ships had returned from India and the west coast of South America &#145;after an absence of from TEN to FOURTEEN MONTHS with PERFECTLY CLEAN BOTTOMS&#146;  (pamphlet appended to G. Peacock, <span class="italic">A Treatise on Ships' Cables</span>).<br>
<br>Peacock was an indefatigable inventor. Aged seventeen he invented and fitted a screw propeller to the longboat of his father's brig <i>Fanny</i>. Between 1828 and 1876, he invented, among many other things, an invulnerable floating battery, a refuge buoy beacon, and Peacock's Synovia, a lubricating preparation for ships' engines. He devised a method of making fresh water from condensed sea water on steamships. Despite its successful use for many years on steamships he served in, the Admiralty scorned the idea. In 1839 someone pirated and patented the system with a few small changes, receiving praise and pecuniary reward from the government: &#145;Such are the Laws of Patent!&#146; wrote Peacock in disgust  (Lpool RO, Pea 3/32). His most charming invention was the Nautilus Bathing Dress of 1828, for &#145;Swimming in Safety with Decorum&#146;. One of these garments, the top half inflatable by means of a nozzle, Captain Peacock carried always with him at sea, keeping it under his pillow at night. In 1879, it was put into manufacture, and he had himself photographed modelling both front and rear elevations. A sense of the ridiculous does not seem to have been among the captain's many estimable qualities.<br>
<br>In 1858, feeling &#145;desirous of ending his days &hellip; with some honourable acknowledgement of his services&#146;  (Peacock, 12), he petitioned the Admiralty to reinstate his name on the list of masters of 1835&#151;but in vain. In 1860 he commanded an unsuccessful expedition, under the patronage of Napoleon III, to look for nitrates in the Sahara.<br>
<br>Peacock published several pamphlets, among them <span class="italic">Official Correspondence</span>, relating to his naval career (1859), <span class="italic">Handbook of Abyssinia</span> (1867), <span class="italic">A Treatise on Ships' Cables</span> (1873), <span class="italic">The Resources of Peru</span> (1874), and <span class="italic">Notes on the Isthmus of Panama and Darien</span> (1879). Peacock's wife, Jane, died in December 1878; his three sons also predeceased him. It was at Ashfield House, Holly Road, Fairfield, near Liverpool, the home of his only daughter, Jane Ash, wife of Henry Cookson, that he died on 6 June 1883. He was buried in the family vault at Starcross, Devon, three days later.<br>
