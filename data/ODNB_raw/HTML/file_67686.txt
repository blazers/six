<span class="headword">Patterson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Burr]</span>,  Gabrielle Ruth Millicent</span>  (1905&#150;1968), <span class="occ">aviator</span>, was born on 6 July 1905 at 23 Blomfield Court, Maida Vale, London, the eldest of four daughters of Malcolm Burr and his wife, Clara Millicent Goode. A mining engineer by profession but an entomologist by inclination, her father followed an explorer's life of prospecting and researching. His wife travelled with him, and Gabrielle and her sisters were educated in various European cities, including Paris, Berlin, Budapest, and Vienna. Having completed her education she was employed by her mother's family firm, Thos Goode &amp; Sons, of South Audley Street, London, purveyors of china and glass to five generations of the royal family, and eventually became its company secretary. But a Mayfair showroom, however grand, was not exciting enough for her, and she took up the new sport of flying. At this time&#151;the 1920s&#151;flying clubs were being established and staffed in the main by ex-RAF pilots flying First World War aircraft.<br>
<br>Having gained a pilot's licence Gabrielle went on to become, in 1931, the first woman to hold an instructor's certificate. About this time she met her future husband, Arthur (Pat) Patterson (<i>d</i>. 1986), and was instrumental in teaching him to fly. They married on 26 June 1931 and their only child, Ian, was born in 1932. Pat qualified as an aviation engineer, and the couple moved around airfields as work opportunities arose. By 1933 they owned a Miles Hawk aircraft and Gabrielle Patterson had gained a B licence at the Cinque Ports Flying Club. This allowed her to fly as a commercial pilot for Silvertown Lubricants Ltd while continuing to instruct for the club. For a short time she was sales manager for the Miles Aircraft Company. The most prestigious aerial sporting event at this time was the king's cup air race, and competition between the early aircraft builders to design an aeroplane capable of winning the cup became intense. Gabrielle entered in 1934, flying a Miles Hawk G-ACTZ designed by &#145;Blossom&#146; Miles, wife of Fred Miles.<br>
<br>In the late 1930s Gabrielle Patterson was a leading figure in women's aviation and gained a lot of publicity. She started her own small flying school at Romford, Kent, in a barn with one Puss Moth. With the formation of the Civil Air Guard in 1938 she became chief instructor (and head of the women's corps of the Civil Air Guard) at Romford. She was joined there by other qualified women instructors who built up their flying hours in the months before the Second World War by training the influx of volunteers keen to take advantage of the cheap subsidized flying in the Civil Air Guard.<br>
<br>In 1939 the Pattersons' marriage failed, and they subsequently divorced. Pat was called up into the Fleet Air Arm and Gabrielle eventually joined the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA). Created only in 1939, the ATA was composed mainly of pilots too old or unfit for the RAF. Referred to as the &#145;ancient and tattered airmen&#146; they released RAF pilots from ferrying duties into active service. Initially there was official disapproval of women pilots, but after ceaseless lobbying Pauline Gower was allowed to form a women's section of the ATA. With 1530 flying hours Gabrielle Patterson was one of the first eight chosen to report for duty at Hatfield on 1 January 1940. At first the women were allowed to fly only training aircraft from the factories to the maintenance units but by the summer they were cleared to fly light operational aircraft. Patterson served as a first officer until the spring of 1943, when after contracting bronchitis she was grounded and subsequently left the ATA.<br>
<br>Gabrielle Patterson was a gifted teacher, always ready to encourage young flyers. Involved from the outset with the Women's Junior Air Corps, from 1946 to 1950 she served as commandant, and as chairman of its aviation committee she wrote the syllabus for the course work. Her outstanding ability was recognized when she became the first woman to be appointed to the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators' panel of examiners. With the resumption of civilian flying after the war she moved to Barton in 1950 to become chief flying instructor of the Lancashire Aero Club, and shortly afterwards went to Ringway airport, Manchester, as chief flying instructor of the British European Airways staff flying club. After several years in this role she was forced to give up aviation for medical reasons, and subsequently read for a degree at Manchester University from 1954 to 1956.<br>
<br>Having won a scholarship in 1956 to the Sorbonne (University of Paris), Patterson, who was a lifelong Francophile, thereafter made her home in France. She taught English for the Otis Elevator Company. In later years she became concerned with the difficulty faced by pilots of non-British nationality in expressing themselves intelligibly in English over the radio-telephone, and gave time and effort to teaching them. After falling ill in 1968 she went to live with her sister Elizabeth at Little Missenden, in Buckinghamshire. She died, of cancer, in Wycombe General Hospital, High Wycombe, on 31 October 1968, and was cremated at Amersham. Her ashes were scattered from the air over White Waltham airfield in March 1969.<br>
