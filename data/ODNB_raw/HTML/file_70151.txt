<span class="headword">Jung,  Meir Zvi</span>  (1858?&#150;1921), <span class="occ">rabbi</span>, was born in Tisza Eszlar, near Tokay, Hungary, then part of the Austrian empire, the son of Rabbi Abraham Jung, a businessman and landowner. He studied in a <i>yeshivah</i> (Talmudic college) in Pressburg under Rabbi Samuel Ehrenfeld and Rabbi S. B. Schreiber. He also studied in Huszt under Rabbi Moses Schick. He gained <i>semichot</i> (rabbinical ordinations) in Pressburg, as well as from Rabbi Isaac Glick of Tolscva, Rabbi Judah Leib Julius of Shebesh, and from Rabbi Solomon Spitzer of Vienna. He received his secular education in the <i>Gymnasium</i> of Budapest. He then studied philosophy, history, and Semitics at a string of German universities including Marburg (under Professor Hermann Cohen), Heidelberg, and Leipzig, gaining his doctorate from the latter under the protestant theologian Professor Franz Delitzsch. He published a study of the <span class="italic">Pirke avot</span> (&#145;ethics of the fathers&#146;) based on his dissertation.<br>
<br>Some time in the 1880s Jung was appointed rabbi in Mannheim, where he staunchly opposed the growing influence of Reform Judaism. In 1891 he took up a position in Ungarisch-Brod, Moravia. He was probably the earliest pioneer in Europe of Jewish day schools that offered secular as well as religious instruction, in the German-Jewish spirit of <span class="italic">Torah im Derekh Eretz</span>. He began a network of <i>Gymnasia</i> in Austria-Hungary, the first opening in Ungarisch-Brod (1901), followed by Lemberg (Lw&oacute;w) (1908), Storozynetz, Bukovina (1906 or 1909), and Vienna (1911). He saw these institutions as a means of counteracting assimilation brought about by attendance at state schools. Jung's schools flourished until 1915 and the dislocation caused by the First World War.<br>
<br>However, another school established in Cracow in September 1906 was short-lived. Jung's schools offered a classical education in Greek and Latin alongside traditional <i>yeshivah</i> training. This combination aroused bitter opposition from the local Hasidim, with the support of Rabbi Issachar Dov Rokeakh of Belz and other Hasidic groups throughout Hungary, and they plastered the streets with posters proclaiming in Hebrew &#145;HaMashchit bo el HaIr&#146; (&#145;The destroyer has come to town&#146;). Jung responded by issuing a Hebrew <i>kol kor&eacute;</i> or open letter addressed to the <i>rebbes</i> (heads of Hasidic sects), appealing to them to support his work. It fell on deaf ears. An unholy alliance was formed between the Hasidim and assimilationist Jews in the city and they made a successful joint appeal to the Galician authorities to have the school closed down.<br>
<br>In 1912, on the recommendation of Rabbi Moritz Gudemann, chief rabbi of Vienna, Jung was selected out of some twenty or thirty applicants to succeed Rabbi Moses Avigdor Chaikin as chief minister of the Federation of Synagogues in London. Within a year Rabbi Jung, a native German speaker, had mastered both Yiddish and English. He founded and was first president of the Va'ad ha Rabbonim (council of rabbis) set up to bolster both standards of religious observance and the influence of the rabbinate in Anglo-Jewish life. He was particularly critical of the inadequate standards of <i>kashrut</i> (kosher food provision) of the chief rabbi's <i>bet din</i> (Jewish ecclesiastical court). Between 1912 and 1915 he acted as unofficial spiritual guide to the Machzike Hadas (&#145;upholders of the faith&#146;) or Spitalfields Great Synagogue, when this was the most influential east European style Orthodox congregation in Britain. However, the authority of the Va'ad and of Jung in particular was never accepted by the rival United Synagogue, which represented the interests of establishment Anglo-Jewry.<br>
<br>Jung continued his educational work in London. In December 1912 he opened a Jewish trade school for the sons of poor East End Jewish immigrants. The curriculum combined paid apprenticeship training with traditional religious studies. However, the school, which settled in premises in Cambridge Heath, Bethnal Green, foundered not for want of potential pupils but for lack of funding from the lay leaders of Anglo-Jewry. Unlike the Jews' Free School, the ethos of Jung's establishment was an unfashionable loyalty to traditional Judaism, not rapid Anglicization designed to smooth passage into British society. In addition, Jung encouraged the introduction of secular studies into the curriculum of the Etz Chaim Yeshiva, the first Talmudic college founded in Britain, in order to widen its appeal.<br>
<br>The Sinai League was another educational initiative of Rabbi Jung's. This was an informal association of youth clubs that combined social activities with Jewish learning, aimed at school leavers, the sons and daughters of the first generation of immigrants who were defecting from their Jewish roots. The clubs, which segregated the sexes, usually met on the premises of synagogues affiliated with the federation and developed a strongly Zionist complexion.<br>
<br>In 1886 Rabbi Jung married Ernestine Silbermann (<i>b</i>. 1860/61), a daughter of Jacob Silbermann of Eperjes (Presov), Slovakia, and sister of Abraham Silbermann, translator and publisher of London. They had six children: four sons and two daughters. The eldest child, Lolla, was born in Mannheim and the rest in Ungarisch-Brod. Two of the sons, Professor Moses Jung (1891&#150;1960) and Rabbi Leo Jung (1892&#150;1987), emigrated to the United States where they both became leading figures in Jewish education, the elder as an academic, eventually professor of comparative religion at Columbia University, New York, and the younger as a congregational rabbi. A third brother, Julius Jung (1894&#150;1975), remained in London; following in his father's footsteps, albeit in a lay capacity, in 1925 he became secretary, and in due course executive director, of the Federation of Synagogues (1952&#150;9). In 1914 Rabbi Jung set up a branch of the non-Zionist Orthodox political party Agudat Yisrael in the East End and invited a number of Hasidic leaders to join, his Cracow experience notwithstanding. When the Aguda was revived after the First World War, he served as secretary of the London branch in 1920&#150;21.<br>
<br>Jung's wife died on 30 January 1915. He married Regina Silbermann (<i>b</i>. 1870/71), his late wife's sister, on 13 April 1921, only weeks before his death. This took place on 10 June 1921 in &#145;tragic circumstances&#146; in his bathroom at home at 14 Bancroft Road, Mile End. An inquest recorded a verdict of &#145;accidental death&#146; caused by &#145;bronchial pneumonia accelerated by coal-gas poisoning&#146;: there had been a gas leak. He was buried on 14 June at the Federation Jewish cemetery, Edmonton, Middlesex.<br>
