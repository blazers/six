<span class="headword">Proctor,  Thomas</span>  (1753&#150;1794), <span class="occ">history painter and sculptor</span>, was born at Settle, Yorkshire, on 22 April 1753. His impoverished father apprenticed him to a tobacconist in Manchester, but he afterwards moved to London, and for a time worked in a merchant's counting-house. In 1777 he enrolled as a student at the Royal Academy Schools. Inspired by the works of James Barry, he painted a large picture, <span class="italic">Adam and Eve</span>, and in 1780 began to exhibit, sending a portrait to the Royal Academy, and another to the Incorporated Society of Artists. In 1782 he gained a premium at the Society of Arts, and a medal at the Royal Academy for life drawing. This early success continued when in 1783 he was awarded a silver medal at the Royal Academy for a model from life, and in 1784 the gold medal for history painting, the subject being a scene from Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Tempest</span>. He then turned to modelling, and produced a statue, <span class="italic">Ixion</span>, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1785, and was so highly praised by Benjamin West that it was bought by the art patron Sir Abraham Hume. He next modelled a group entitled <span class="italic">The Death of Diomedes, King of Thrace</span>, which was greatly admired at the academy in 1786, but not purchased. Bitterly disappointed, Proctor broke his work in pieces and abandoned sculpture.<br>
<br>Proctor reverted to painting, but did not again exhibit until 1789, and then sent only a portrait; but in 1790 he contributed to the exhibition of the Society of Artists <span class="italic">Coronis</span>, a subject from Ovid's <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span>, and to the Royal Academy <span class="italic">Elisha and the Son of the Shunammite</span>, and <span class="italic">The Restoration of Day after the Fall of Phaethon</span>, a sketch. In 1791 he exhibited at the academy <span class="italic">Hannah Declines Accompanying her Husband to the Yearly Sacrifice</span>, and in 1792 two portraits and a group in plaster, <span class="italic">Peirithous, the Son of Ixion, Destroyed by Cerberus</span>. Three portraits and <span class="italic">The Final Separation of Jason and Medea</span> were his exhibited works in 1793, and <span class="italic">Venus Approaching the Island of Cyprus</span> in 1794. After 1790 Proctor exhibited without giving an address, and his abode was unknown to his contemporaries. West, then president of the Royal Academy, discovered that he had been living in London in miserable circumstances at Clare Market. West brought his case to the notice of the council of the Royal Academy, and in 1793 it was resolved that he should be sent to Italy as the travelling student, with a grant of &pound;50 for preliminary expenses. Unfortunately the generous help came too late. Before he could leave England he was found dead in his bed, worn out by mental anguish and privation. He was buried in Hampstead churchyard on 13 July 1794.<br>
