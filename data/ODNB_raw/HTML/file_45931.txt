<span class="headword">Prout,  Elizabeth</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Mary Joseph of Jesus]</span>  (1820&#150;1864), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic nun</span>, was born on 2 September 1820 in Coleham, Shrewsbury, the only child of Edward Prout, a cooper, and his wife, Ann Yates. She was baptized on 17 September 1820 in St Julian's church, Shrewsbury. By 1841 she and her parents were living in New Brewery Yard, at Stone, Staffordshire. After the arrival of the Passionist priest Dominic Barberi in nearby Aston Hall in 1842, Elizabeth became a Catholic under his influence. In July 1848, on the recommendation of another Passionist, Father Gaudentius Rossi, she entered the convent of the Sisters of the Infant Jesus in Northampton. By 1849, however, she had contracted tuberculosis in her knee and had to leave the noviciate.<br>
<br>Back at Stone, Elizabeth Prout recovered her health, but met with so much opposition to her Catholicism from her mother that she decided to leave home. With the help of Father Rossi she found a teaching post in St Chad's, Manchester. She was then invited by him and her parish priest, Father Robert Croskell, to co-operate with them in founding a new religious order. Then aged only twenty-nine, she was the youngest and the first Catholic Englishwoman to found a religious order in nineteenth-century England. Her congregation marked a break with tradition, offering a consecrated religious life, with choir observance for all, no dowry, and no class distinctions, to women of the working and lower middle classes who could not afford the dowries required by the established orders. With the approval of Bishop William Turner of Salford, Elizabeth and five companions professed their simple vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience on 21 November 1854. From then she was known as Mother Mary Joseph of Jesus. Both contemplative and active, Mother Mary Joseph's congregation was distinguished, like the Passionist congregation, by the spirituality of St Paul of the Cross. The congregation helped to provide Catholic education in the working-class districts of Manchester, the inhabitants of which included the poorest Irish immigrants, many of them refugees from the famine of the late 1840s. The sisters also visited the poor in their own homes, instructed converts, provided retreats for women, and worked at vestment making and other forms of church needlework.<br>
<br>In 1853, with the exception of Mother Mary Joseph, all the sisters caught fever. After a period of recuperation at Newton Heath, they moved to Levenshulme in April 1854. There, as well as opening a school for the poor children of the locality, Mother Mary Joseph kept a boarding-school for lower-middle-class girls. She made other foundations in Ashton under Lyne and in Sutton and Blackbrook near St Helens, Lancashire, in 1855. She had to close her convent in Ashton in 1857 when one of her sisters plunged the congregation into debt, but returned in 1862 to conduct sewing classes and night schools for the unemployed girls and women during the Lancashire cotton famine. She hoped to open a home for factory girls in Ashton but was unable to acquire the land.<br>
<br>Although lively and enterprising, Mother Mary Joseph was small in stature and physically delicate. She died of tuberculosis at the Holy Cross Convent, Sutton, on 11 January 1864 and was buried in St Anne's Monastery cemetery in Sutton three days later. During the next century her congregation opened new houses throughout the British Isles and in North and South America, Botswana, Sweden, and Papua New Guinea, totalling sixty-three houses in 1964. In 1973 her remains were exhumed from the monastery cemetery and reinterred in the adjacent church of St Anne and Blessed Dominic, Sutton, beside those of Father Dominic Barberi and Father Ignatius Spencer. The cause for her canonization was opened by Archbishop Worlock of Liverpool on 18 May 1994.<br>
