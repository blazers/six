<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Quare,  Daniel</span>  (1648/9&#150;1724), <span class="occ">maker of clocks, watches, and barometers</span>, is presumed to have been of a strict Quaker family, but nothing is known of his parentage. It has been suggested he was a native of Somerset, perhaps on account of the former existence of a manor named Quarre in that county, coupled with the fact that Besse records a John Quire of Misterton, Somerset, who was fined in the 1660s for his Quaker beliefs. Nor is anything known of his apprenticeship, the earliest record of Quare appearing in the minutes of a Clockmakers' Company quarter court held in London on 3 April 1671 when he was &#145;admitted and Sworne a Brother of the Company&#146;, paying &pound;3. He was also ordered to abandon an illegally recruited and unidentified apprentice; he enrolled the first of his fifteen authorized pupils in June 1673.<br>
<br>Quare's premises were subjected to a Clockmakers' &#145;search&#146; in March 1675 when he was working in the &#145;Middle or Cittie&#146; precinct&#151;one of three company divisions at that date. He was probably in St Martin's-le-Grand, which was his address when he married Mary, daughter of Jeremiah Stevens, maltster, of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, on 18 April 1676; the ceremony took place at a Friends' meeting at Devonshire House, Bishopsgate, where Quare was one of the early members. A clock by him is recorded signed with a more precise address&#151;&#145;in Martins Neare Alders Gate Londini&#146;,&#151;where he was still living in August 1680. One authority reports, without verifiable reference, that he next had a business at the Plough and Harrow in Cornhill, but by June 1682 he was in the parish of All Hallows, Lombard Street, where, in 1683, he was lodging with one Edward Hoult. By 1686 he was established in Exchange Alley in the parish of St Mary Woolnoth in the heart of the City. Many renowned watchmakers flourished there, and Quare took over the premises vacated by Robert Seignior, who had been appointed in 1682 to succeed Edward East as the king's chief clockmaker, though in the event East outlived him. No business association between Seignior and Quare has been discovered but doubtless Quare inherited a measure of goodwill. Seignior named the shop The Dial but Quare used the King's Arms as his address. The adjoining shops were occupied by a confectioner and a vintner.<br>
<br>Quare, it may be presumed of one of his faith, was a peace-loving and honest member of the community but he came into conflict with authorities by refusing, in accordance with his beliefs, to pay tithes or to swear an oath; either action could have brought about his disownment. Consequently, goods to the value of &pound;5 were seized from him in 1678 to offset his rate of &pound;2 12<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. &#145;for the maintenance of the Parochial Priests in London&#146;, two clocks and two watches worth &pound;11 5<i>s</i>. were taken from him in 1679 when he refused to contribute towards the militia, and in 1682&#150;3 Quare and five other Friends had goods to the value of &pound;145 17<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. seized for attending a proscribed meeting at White Hart Court. On 4 June 1686 Quare was summoned, with about fifty other Friends, to appear before the commissioners appointed by James II to hear their grievances. Matters were eased by the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> of 1689 but plate worth just over &pound;3 was taken from him that year for tithes and priests' maintenance. He subsequently served the parliamentary committee of the meeting for sufferings, disbursing over &pound;350 in expenses in 1700&#150;02.<br>
<br>Quare's religious leanings did not exclude him from election to parish duties, though he was not keen to serve and twice paid fines to be excused. Nevertheless, he was a member of the vestry committee of St Mary Woolnoth in 1693, a sidesman in 1694, and one of two collectors for the poor in 1696. In September 1698, while away in Flanders, he was chosen to be a member of the court of assistants of the Clockmakers' Company. He later served them in higher office: in September 1705 he was elected junior warden, and he rose through the ranks of renter and senior warden to become master in September 1708.<br>
<br>In 1695 an ambitious lottery, the proceeds of which were to finance two colleges of science and art, offered 2000 winners the opportunity to learn a chosen trade. Quare and his former apprentice John Marshall, by then working &#145;against the Royal Exchange&#146;, volunteered to teach the art of watch making. The scheme failed through lack of interest but in the following year Quare assisted John Bellers in drawing up his <span class="italic">Proposals for Raising a College of Industry of All Useful Trades</span> (1695); although the bill did not succeed before parliament, it led to the establishment of the Quaker workhouse at Clerkenwell, where Quare was said to have been &#145;responsible for some boys there for many years&#146;.<br>
<br>Quare worked in relative obscurity until the 1680s and he may well have spent most of the 1670s in the employment of others. His early work is rare and displays no significant contribution to the improvement of mechanical designs. Two events brought him to the fore: first, his move to Exchange Alley between 1683 and 1686 placed him in the centre of London's business quarter (where he was said to have successfully speculated in the shares and funds with which it abounded); second, in 1687, he played a major part in the Clockmakers' Company's opposition to Edward Barlow's patent application for &#145;pulling or repeating clocks and watches&#146;. James II judged that Barlow's watch, made by Tompion, was inferior to one submitted by Quare because it required two buttons to be pushed instead of Quare's one. This was a tremendous boost to Quare's reputation and secured his place in horological history. The Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, holds a watch believed to be that proffered by Quare and supposedly retained by James. It has been claimed that Quare adapted the concentric minute hand, but examples by several other makers are now recorded to show this was not the case. In the first decade of the eighteenth century he was, however, among the first to use jewel endstones in watches to improve the action and durability of escapements, and to use dust caps to help keep movements clean.<br>
<br>In August 1695 Quare was granted a fourteen-year patent for &#145;the sole use and benefit of a Portable Weather Glass or Barometer, by him invented&#146;, which could &#145;be removed and carried to any place, though turned upside down, without spilling one drop of the quicksilver, or letting any air into the tube&#146;. The Clockmakers' Company opposed this application too, and it is questionable whether or not Quare deserved priority; a similar design had already been published in Holland in 1688 and Robert Hooke reported that Thomas Tompion had made an example a year earlier. When William Derham carried out barometric experiments at the Monument in 1696 he used two of Quare's &#145;best portable barometers&#146;. Several examples have survived but it is unlikely that any has its original tube.<br>
<br>Quare's influential standing came to be of use to Friends when appealing to the throne. On his petition two Friends imprisoned in Westmorland were released and on 2 May 1695 he introduced four Friends, including George Whitehead and Gilbert Latey, to a private interview with William III when a statement on the sufferings of Friends was presented to the king. Quare and nineteen other Quakers signed a petition to the Commons, presented by Edmond Waller on 7 February 1696. When in Flanders in 1698 upon business Quare distributed Latin copies of Robert Barclay's <span class="italic">Apologies</span>, reporting upon his return that it was &#145;much more desired&#146; in French. Such an edition was published in 1702.<br>
<br>Though Quare was never a clock- or watchmaker to the crown, he certainly enjoyed royal patronage. At Hampton Court an enormous 10 foot-high year-going burr walnut timepiece he made for William III was still standing in his bedchamber at the end of the twentieth century. It has dials to show the times of sunrise and sunset, and the latitude, and it was able to display either solar time or mean time until 1836 when it was altered by Vulliamy. In 1691&#150;2 Quare supplied William with a repeating watch costing &pound;69 17<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. which was reported to be &#145;still in a good state of preservation&#146; in 1866, though its later whereabouts are unknown. At Windsor Castle a small travelling clock with gilded brass case survives, the movement of which originally provided a choice of balance or pendulum control, a mechanism previously seen only in two clocks by Tompion, also of royal provenance, from whom Quare may have acquired the movement of this clock. It lacks any personal cipher but could have been made between about 1705 and 1715 for either Anne or George I. Quare also supplied at least three barometers, of which two were at Hampton Court in the 1990s. He was held in especially high regard by George I, and at Friends' House is a copy of his paper dated 4 February 1715 refusing George's invitation to be the king's watchmaker for &pound;300 per annum. He declined because he could not swear an oath but begged the king not to appoint anyone else. The king told Quare, then aged about sixty-seven, that he could call to see him at any time and, accordingly, the yeoman of the guard at the back stairs let him &#145;frequently go up without calling any body for leave as otherwise is usual, tho Persons of Quality&#146;. Quare also mentioned in passing that in forty years he had served &#145;men of the Greatest Rank of most other Nations in Europe, as well as this Nation&#146;.<br>
<br>Of Quare's children who survived infancy (and seven did not), Jeremiah was a &#145;merchant&#146;, Anna married John Falconer in 1705, Sarah married Jacob Wyan in 1712, and Elizabeth married Silvanus Bevan, &#145;citizen and apothecary&#146;, in 1715. The weddings were lavish affairs attended by nobility, foreign ambassadors and envoys, and leading Quakers including William Penn and George Whitehead.<br>
<br>About 1721 or 1722 Quare took into partnership his former apprentice, Stephen Horseman, who was bound in January 1701 and made free in September 1709. Horseman, also a Quaker, in 1712 married Quare's niece Mary Savage, who lived in Exchange Alley with her uncle, who consented to the marriage. Towards the end of his life Quare retired to the country, acquiring a property at Croydon where he died, aged seventy-five, on 21 March 1724; he was buried at the Quaker burial-ground, Bunhill Fields, on the 27th. The <span class="italic">Daily Post</span> of 26 March reported: &#145;Last week dy'd Mr. Daniel Quare, watch and clock maker in Exchange Alley, who was famous both here and at foreign courts for the great improvements he made in that art and we hear he is succeeded in his shop and trade by his partner Mr. Horseman&#146;. Quare's will, dated 3 May 1723, named his son Jeremiah executor and was proved on 26 March 1724. He left &pound;2800 and all his household goods in London and Croydon to his wife, Mary, along with &#145;the two gold watches she usually wears, one of them being a repeater and the other a plain watch&#146;; six grandchildren received &pound;400 each and Jeremiah inherited &pound;2000 and the residue of the estate. Mary spent her last years with Jeremiah in the parish of St Dionis Backchurch, Lime Street; she died, aged seventy-seven, on 4 November 1728. Jeremiah died in the following year. Horseman continued the Exchange Alley business until he was declared bankrupt, a notice appearing in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, 1 December 1730; Richard Peckover, present in the alley from at least March 1731, is believed to have then taken over the goodwill.<br>
<br>Between about 1680 and 1685 Quare began numbering watches in series, and between then and 1724 his business retailed nearly 6500&#151;roughly 5000 timepieces, 1150 repeating watches, and 300 clockwatches and alarm watches. He numbered them in two series, the first accommodating all types of watch, the second, begun about 1688, being exclusively for repeating watches. It was not until between 1705 and 1710 that he began to number his clocks in a series which exceeded 300 items, though it is probable the business sold twice that number. These series were continued by Horseman, and Peckover then continued the watch series. Quare also numbered his barometers, that series reaching about 150. Many forgeries of Quare's work were produced both in England and on the continent.<br>
<br>Aesthetically, much of Quare's seventeenth-century work is indistinguishable from that of many of his contemporaries&#151;he did not sell standard models with recognizable features as did Tompion and Knibb&#151;and it was not until the turn of the century that his characteristic designs of clock case and dial developed. He made or retailed most types of clock and watch (though there is no evidence that he ever worked on turret clocks) and the wide range of styles of workmanship found in their movements reflects not only the extent of his employment of others but also the lack of rigid implementation of workshop practices. Quare's own hand is unrecognizable. The daybook of Richard Wright of Warrington, Lancashire, reveals that Quare's business did not rely solely upon London outworkers because in 1721&#150;2 Horseman sent Wright fourteen watches, one at a time, in different stages of production, for finishing. Quare also retailed several table clocks whose movements, far superior to any others bearing his name, were made by Tompion's workmen. In 1720 the London clockmaker Joseph Williamson claimed, probably legitimately, to have made Quare's equation clocks including a 400-day clock showing true and mean time which Quare, &#145;for whom I wrought mostly&#146;, supplied to Charles II of Spain about 1700. Thomas Grignion worked for Quare as a finisher, probably of watches, and John Penkethman also appears to have been associated with him; in 1720 Penkethman advertised from his shop in Exchange Alley for the recovery of a lost, almost new, Quare watch, and a poor tax assessment of 1725 locates him &#145;under Mr Quares&#146;. Daniel Quare is also likely to have employed the watchmaker Robert Quare, who in 1695 lived with his family a short distance away in Lothbury, lodging with a Thomas Paul, possibly the clockmaker. Robert Quare's relationship to Daniel has not been established. Watches by Robert are recorded, and his son, also named Daniel, was the last of Quare's apprentices. Among Quare's other pupils were Richard Vick, appointed watch- and clockmaker to George I in 1722 and master of the Clockmakers' Company in 1729, Joshua Appleby, who served as master in 1745, and John Marshall, who is recorded as the inventor of the &#145;Magic Night Watch&#146;.<br>
