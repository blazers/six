<span class="headword">Pearce,  Ernest Harold</span>  (1865&#150;1930), <span class="occ">bishop of Worcester</span>, was born on 23 July 1865 at 48 Great Marlborough Street, London, the eldest son of James Pearce and his wife, Jane Courtenay Edmonds. His place of birth then housed the west branch of the Young Men's Christian Association, of which his father was the secretary. His mother was the eldest daughter of Walter Edmonds, of Penzance, and sister of the Revd Walter John Edmonds, chancellor of Exeter Cathedral. A severe attack of rheumatic fever at the age of seven seriously affected Pearce's heart and left him fearful of over-exertion for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>In 1874, on the presentation of the banker F. A. Bevan, Pearce was admitted to Christ's Hospital, and began a lifetime connection with the school: he was exhibitioner, assistant master, governor, almoner, chairman of the education committee, and vice-chairman of the council of almoners. He also became its historian in <span class="italic">The Annals of Christ's Hospital</span> (1901). In 1884 Pearce, who was a Grecian at Christ's Hospital, entered Peterhouse, Cambridge, as a classical scholar and choral exhibitioner, and obtained second classes in the first division of the classical tripos (1887) and in the second part of the theological tripos (1888), graduating BA in 1887 and MA in 1891. He was ordained deacon in 1889 and priest in 1890 by Archbishop Benson, and went as an assistant master to the South Eastern College, Ramsgate. In 1891 he returned to Christ's Hospital as an assistant master, but in 1892 accepted the post of metropolitan district secretary of the British and Foreign Bible Society, of which he ultimately became a life governor, and vice-president in 1914.<br>
<br>In 1895 Pearce was appointed to the vacancy in the living of Christ Church Greyfriars, London, where the boys of Christ's Hospital attended the Sunday morning service: he soon re-seated the church and brought the boys down from uncomfortable galleries to the floor of the building. Pearce's appointment to the living led to his becoming chaplain in 1896&#150;7 to the lord mayor of London, Sir George Faudel-Phillips, the alderman of his ward, and to a close association for many years with the Mansion House and the life of the City. During this time he became a freeman on the roll of the Musicians' Company and served as its chaplain; he was professor of biblical history at Queen's College, Harley Street (1899&#150;1905); for four years he was secretary of the London Diocesan Church Reading Union; he was elected on to the court of Sion College, became treasurer and president, and in 1913 published its history, <span class="italic">Sion College and Library</span>; he was a member of the court of assistants of the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy, was twenty-nine times a steward of its festival, and for ten years a treasurer, and wrote an account of the charity, <span class="italic">The Sons of the Clergy</span> (1904).<br>
<br>In 1899 Pearce joined the staff of <span class="italic">The Times</span> as its ecclesiastical correspondent and was in Printing House Square every night, except Saturday, in order to write up the news and to provide obituaries and editorials as appropriate. About this time he came into close contact with the prime minister's office and became an unofficial adviser in the allocation of ecclesiastical patronage, a position of influence he retained for much of the rest of his life. Interestingly, he was later criticized for his bias in the distribution of his own patronage as bishop and responded frankly: &#145;My business is to keep &#147;advanced&#148; men out of the diocese. You must look to my successor to redress the balance&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 Oct 1930, 16).<br>
<br>In 1911 Pearce was appointed by the prime minister, H. H. Asquith, to a canonry at Westminster Abbey, where he later became treasurer (1912&#150;16), archdeacon (1916&#150;18), and subdean (1918&#150;19). Pearce spent a large amount of time in the abbey's archives and produced a significant work of ecclesiastical and monastic history, a register entitled <span class="italic">The Monks of Westminster</span> (1916). He also wrote two lives, <span class="italic">William de Colchester, Abbot of Westminster</span> (1915), and <span class="italic">Walter de Wenlok, Abbot of Westminster</span> (1920). Through this research he qualified for the Cambridge degrees of LittD (1917), BD (1920), and DD (1924).<br>
<br>In the First World War Pearce was appointed assistant chaplain-general (1915&#150;19), with the substantive rank of brigadier, and greatly improved the organization and efficiency of the chaplain's department of the War Office. He was a chaplain to George V in 1918 and 1919, and in 1919, at the close of the war, was made CBE.<br>
<br>In 1919 Pearce was nominated by Lloyd George to the bishopric of Worcester, and was consecrated in Westminster Abbey on 24 February. It was as an &#145;able and modest administrator&#146; rather than as a &#145;profound thinker&#146; or a great preacher that Pearce left an impression as bishop  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 Oct 1930). Although often overly stubborn in his views, Pearce won respect for his business skills in running the diocese. But his ability not to take himself too seriously was shown in a disagreement with the theologian H. D. A. Major over whether a nominee for a particular post needed more parochial experience. Major provided a list of &#145;first-class bishops&#146; who had little such experience. Pearce admitted the point and added, &#145;If you had made a list of bishops of the second or third class it might have included myself&#146;  (Stephenson, 139). In the controversies over the prayer book in 1927&#150;8, Pearce always took the conservative side, and he spoke and voted in the House of Lords against the approval of the &#145;deposited book&#146;.<br>
<br>His antiquarian interests (he was elected FSA in 1918) led Pearce to work upon the Worcester Cathedral archives and to edit for the Worcestershire Historical Society <span class="italic">The Register of Thomas de Cobham, 1317&#150;1327</span> (1930); and from his knowledge of the register he had already published, <span class="italic">Thomas de Cobham, Bishop of Worcester</span> (1923). Other works included studies of early Christianity (1908) and the laws of the earliest gospel (1913).<br>
<br>Pearce's own college, Peterhouse, elected him an honorary fellow in 1919 and, after incorporating at Oxford and proceeding to the degree of DLitt in 1929, Worcester College, Oxford, paid him the same honour. Pearce never married. He served as a director of the London Life Association Ltd (which had absorbed the clergy mutual office). He was declared dead at Westminster Hospital, London, on 28 October 1930, after collapsing in Old Palace Yard, near St Margaret's Church, while on his way to attend the opening of parliament. He was cremated at Golders Green on 31 October and his ashes are buried in Worcester Cathedral at the foot of the monument of Bishop Hurd. Pearce's edition of the correspondence of Hurd with William Mason was published in 1930 posthumously.<br>
