<span class="headword">Reilly,  Sidney George</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Shlomo  ben Hersh Rozenblium]</span>  (1874&#150;1925), <span class="occ">spy</span>, dubbed the Ace of Spies, was born Shlomo (Solomon) ben Hersh Rozenblium on 24 March 1874 in Bedzin, Piotrk&oacute;w Guberniia, Russian Poland, the only son of Hersh (Grigory) ben Yakov Rozenblium and his wife, Paulina Bramson. He had two sisters, Elena and Mariam. His father was a contractor and minor landowner active in the Jewish emancipation movement. Among his ancestors was the Jewish theologian Elijah ben Solomon, gaon of Vilna (1720&#150;1797).<br>
<br>Details of Reilly's education are uncertain. Despite later claims, he did not attend Heidelberg or Cambridge universities or the Royal School of Mines. Nevertheless he demonstrated sufficient knowledge of chemistry to gain membership in the Chemical Society in 1896 and the Institute of Chemistry in 1897. He had an exceptional command of languages, including English, Russian, Polish, German, and French.<br>
<br>As Sigmund Salomon Georgjevitch Rosenblum he arrived in London in 1895. In 1899 he became Sidney George Reilly by receiving a passport in that name, though he never legally adopted it or became a British subject. A patron, possibly his entr&eacute;e into British intelligence, was Sir Henry Hozier (1838&#150;1907), powerful secretary of Lloyds connected to the War Office intelligence branch. With his strong Jewish features and accented English, Reilly was an unconvincing Englishman, but this became his favourite of many alternative identities.<br>
<br>Reilly was married at least four times but never divorced. His first marriage in 1898 was to Margaret Callahan Thomas (1874&#150;1933), a governess and the widow of the Revd Hugh Thomas, from whom he separated by 1904. Between 1904 and 1908 he was married to a Russian woman with whom he maintained a relationship through the mid-1920s. Two children were produced by this union, a son and a daughter, but their names and fates are unknown. In 1910 Reilly took another Russian bride, Nadya Petrovna Zalessky (1888&#150;<i>c</i>.1949), the former wife of a tsarist naval official; they separated in 1919. He married a British actress, Pepita Bobadilla 
    (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Nelly Louise Burton; 1894&#150;<i>c</i>.1970)
  , widow of playwright Charles Haddon Chambers, in 1923.<br>
<br>Reilly was a collector of books and artwork, particularly Napoleona. He was an aviation enthusiast and helped found one of the first aviation firms in Russia, Krylya, in 1910. He also was a member of the Imperial All-Russian Aero Club. He was a freemason.<br>
<br>Reilly's espionage career, as much commercial as political, was long and complex. From 1899 to 1905 he was mostly in the Far East. In 1904 he directed the trading firm M. A. Ginsburg &amp; Co. in Port Arthur, China, and supplied information to both Japan and Russia. The years 1906&#150;14 found him based in St Petersburg, where he developed a wide array of personal and professional contacts extending from the revolutionary underground to the imperial court. In 1914 he went to New York as a war contractor and became a powerful influence in Russian purchasing. His ruthless business tactics earned him a fortune and many enemies. Reilly entered the Royal Flying Corps as second lieutenant in October 1917 and served at that rank until demobilization in April 1920. He received the Military Cross in 1919. An effort to secure his honorary commission as a major in the army failed, in part due to political objections.<br>
<br>The First World War saw Reilly become a formal agent of the British Secret Intelligence Service in whose employ he remained until 1922. In 1918 he spearheaded a bold if unsuccessful plot to topple Lenin's regime, the misnamed Lockhart plot. Thereafter he ostensibly devoted himself to the anti-Bolshevik cause and became the key adviser to one of the Soviets' militant opponents, Boris Savinkov (1879&#150;1924). In 1924 Reilly was a charter member of the International League to Combat the III International and in the same year helped found the American affiliate, the Anti-Bolshevik League. However, Reilly's memoranda to the SIS and various British officials reveal a measured approach to the Soviet regime. He judged the abrupt and total overthrow of the Bolsheviks as unwise and unnecessary and advocated policies aimed at shifting leadership from ideologues to more pragmatic hands. Economic incentives played a vital role in these plans. In pursuit of this goal he returned to Soviet Russia in late 1925 and was captured by Soviet police. Russian records suggest that Reilly was executed in Moscow on 5 November 1925 but this, as with previous contradictory statements on his demise, is by no means definitive. He is said to have been buried in Moscow on 9 November.<br>
<br>Estimates of Reilly's character vary widely. Some saw in him Baron Munchausen, others Mephistopheles. The official verdict, as rendered by the Foreign Office's Sir Nevile Bland, was that Reilly was &#145;a man of great courage &hellip; coupled with a somewhat unscrupulous temperament, [making] him a rather double edged tool&#146;  (FO 371/12605). An American business rival, Samuel Vauclain, observed that he was &#145;not only a keen-witted and resourceful businessman, but, when in a tight place, proved &hellip; an ingenious diplomat&#146;  (Office of Naval Intelligence, file 21010, 34). Reilly, however, had his champions, among them his wartime SIS chief and later business partner Sir William Wiseman, Sir Robert Nathan, and perhaps most notably Sir Winston Churchill. There remains a division among those who regard Reilly as a martyr to the anti-communist cause (Brook-Shepherd) and those who see him as a devious Soviet double agent  (Lockhart, <span class="italic">First Man</span>). He was all that and more. Reilly was indifferent to matters of ideology; his only true loyalty was to himself.<br>
