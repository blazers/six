<span class="headword">Kenney,  James</span>  (1780&#150;1849), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born in Ireland, the son of James Kenney (<i>fl</i>. 1760&#150;1800), well known in English sporting circles. Nothing is known of his childhood or education, but his father was for many years manager of the Savour Vivre Club in St James's Street, London, and it was presumably he who placed Kenney in the London banking house of Herries, Farquhar &amp; Co. Despite a diffidence which, in later life, exhibited itself as a nervous inability to make up his mind on even the most trivial issues, Kenney declared his literary ambitions in 1803 by publishing <span class="italic">Society, a Poem in Two Parts, with other Poems</span>, which made little impact.<br>
<br>Kenney persisted, however, and the production at Covent Garden on 5 November 1803 of his first play, <span class="italic">Raising the Wind</span>, made his reputation. It remains his strongest claim to a place in dramatic history, above all for its creation of the charming confidence trickster Jeremy Diddler. Before submitting the play to Covent Garden, Kenney had played Jeremy Diddler in an amateur performance, but it was the ageing William &#145;Gentleman&#146; Lewis who made the part, and the play, famous. <span class="italic">Raising the Wind</span> ran for thirty-eight nights in its first season, and its success enabled Kenney to abandon the safety of the bank for the danger of a playwright's career. He was already well enough acquainted with the London theatres to have shaped his first play according to the strengths of the Covent Garden company. Not only did Jeremy Diddler slot in to Lewis's line in lounge lizards, but there was also a shrewdly comic Yorkshire servant for the popular tyke John Emery and a female grotesque for Mrs Davenport.<br>
<br>It was by providing such custom-built plays for actors, singers, and theatre managers that Kenney sought to sustain his forty-year career in London. His name is linked to more than fifty pieces, and he had a hand in many others. <span class="italic">Raising the Wind</span> was followed by three musical pieces, comic operas in the style of the day, with music by Matthew Peter King. The third of these, a comic opera in three acts called <span class="italic">False Alarms</span>, opened at Drury Lane on 12 January 1807 and ran for twenty-one nights. Its popularity was enhanced by the contribution of the singer&#150;composer John Braham, and in particular by Braham's setting of Kenney's sentimental ballad, &#145;Said a Smile to a Tear&#146;. When the taste for melodrama declared itself, Kenney supplied Drury Lane with <span class="italic">Ella Rosenberg</span>, an early example of domestic Gothic, which opened on 19 November 1807 with Mrs Siddons in the title role. On 31 March 1808 the same theatre staged his first comedy, <span class="italic">The World</span>, which ran for twenty-three nights. &#145;Ah! where is Kenney's wit?&#146;, asked Byron a year later in <span class="italic">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</span>, complaining that <span class="italic">The World</span> &#145;tires the sad gallery, lulls the listless Pit&#146;. Byron was not alone in perceiving in the play's popularity evidence of the destitution of contemporary comedy, but Kenney made no attempt to answer his critics. He was much liked for his good humour, and for his unwillingness to join in malicious gossip. J. R. Planch&eacute;, who could not remember Kenney's &#145;saying a severe thing of or to anyone&#146;, recalled an occasion when his nervous friend, startled by a sudden noise, exclaimed, &#145;Is&#151;<i>Heaven</i> broke loose?&#146;  (Planch&eacute;, 1.125&#150;6).<br>
<br>Accepted into literary circles after the success of <span class="italic">The World</span>, Kenney was a regular guest of Samuel Rogers, and numbered Charles Lamb among his close friends. By 1812 he had become prosperous enough to marry, but not, perhaps, to marry as he did. Louisa Mercier (<i>c</i>.1780&#150;1853) had become the fourth wife of the playwright-novelist Thomas Holcroft in April 1799. When Holcroft died in March 1809, Louisa was left in sole charge of their twin daughters and of two daughters from Holcroft's third marriage. She and Kenney were married on 5 March 1812, and had four further children, of whom <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15404/', "Charles Lamb Kenney (1821&#150;1881)")</script> is the best-known. The struggle to maintain his extended family was a given circumstance for the rest of Kenney's working life. He continued to write in a variety of dramatic genres, ranging from tragedy (<span class="italic">The Pledge</span> of 1831 was a version of Hugo's <span class="italic">Hernani</span> and <span class="italic">The Sicilian Vespers</span> of 1840 an adaptation of a play by Casimir Delavigne) to burlesque (<span class="italic">Aladdin</span> at the Lyceum in 1844), but his greatest successes, in association with the actor John Liston, were in farce. <span class="italic">Love, Law and Physic</span>, which opened at Covent Garden on 20 November 1812, provided Liston with the first, and most enduring, of a string of lower middle-class cockney roles, Lubin Log. It was followed, in 1814, by <span class="italic">Debtor and Creditor</span>, with Liston as Gosling. The partnership was renewed at the Haymarket on 7 July 1823, when Liston created the lovelorn cockney waiter Billy Lackaday in Kenney's <span class="italic">Sweethearts and Wives</span>, and continued at Drury Lane, where Liston played Knipper Clipper in <span class="italic">Thirteen to the Dozen</span> (1826) and the shipwrecked cockney Bowbell in Kenney's unfairly neglected <span class="italic">The Illustrious Stranger</span>, which opened on 4 October 1827.<br>
<br>At about this time, Kenney was briefly associated with Elliston in the management of Drury Lane, but his nervous disposition was unequal to the strain of theatrical in-fighting. His appearance was so affected by his anxiety that &#145;he was more than once taken for an escaped lunatic&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). After his marriage to Louisa, Kenney lived for several years in St Val&eacute;ry-sur-Somme, where Louisa may have plumped the family income by instructing private pupils. Kenney died of heart disease at his home, 22 South Terrace, Alexander Square, Brompton, London, on 25 July 1849. That the family was suffering financial hardship is suggested by the staging of a benefit performance at Drury Lane on the day of his death. On 13 October 1849 his widow was awarded a civil-list pension of &pound;40 a year which passed to her dependent daughters on her death on 17 July 1853.<br>
