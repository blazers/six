<span class="headword">Atkins, Sir  Ivor Algernon</span>  (1869&#150;1953), <span class="occ">organist and choirmaster</span>, was born on 29 November 1869 at Llandaff, near Cardiff, the sixth child and third son of Frederick Pyke Atkins (1830&#150;1897), organist of St John's parish church in Cardiff, and his wife, Harriet Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rogers. He was educated privately, studying music with his father and Charles Lee Williams (organist of Llandaff Cathedral, 1876&#150;82), and assisted his father at Cardiff before becoming sub-organist to George Robertson Sinclair at the cathedrals of Truro (1885&#150;9) and Hereford (1890&#150;93). In 1893 he was appointed organist of Ludlow parish church. As a non-resident scholar, he earned a BMus degree through Queen's College, Oxford. On 27 April 1899 he married Katharine May Dorothea 
    (Dora; 1869/70&#150;1954)
  , the daughter of the Revd Edward Butler, of Llangoed Castle. They had one child, Edward Wulstan Ivor (<i>b</i>. 1904).<br>
<br>The appointment which defined Atkins's career was that in 1897 to Worcester Cathedral, where he remained organist until 1950. The post involved conducting the Three Choirs festival, which included orchestral conducting. For this he had no training but gradual experience. In a 1938 performance of Rakhmaninov's second piano concerto, soloist and orchestra finished together, but Atkins was seen to conduct two extra beats. During his final active years, after the Second World War, Atkins's conducting was criticized by younger musicians accustomed to the rising standards encouraged by increased broadcasting and gramophone recording. Atkins's organ playing was not brilliant. But he was a tall, forceful man with considerable administrative skills. These he had brought to bear on the formidable task of restarting the Three Choirs festival after its cessation during the First World War. His achievement was recognized by a knighthood in the new year's honours of 1921.<br>
<br>At Worcester Cathedral, Atkins cut through the Victorian accretions to revive the music of his Tudor predecessors Thomas Tomkins and Nathaniel Patrick. But the strongest association of his career was with Edward Elgar and his music. In 1902 he secured the first Three Choirs festival performance of Elgar's <span class="italic">The Dream of Gerontius</span>, in the teeth of ecclesiastical objections to J. H. Newman's Catholic text; thereafter <span class="italic">Gerontius</span> became a staple of the festival. Atkins saw to it that later Worcester festivals included each new major work by Elgar, usually under the composer's inimitable direction, regularly revived and repeated. His friendship with Elgar, lasting forty years until the older man's death, was the greatest of Atkins's life.<br>
<br>Atkins's Worcester festival programmes, from 1899 to 1948, showed imagination and balance. Parry, Coleridge-Taylor, Walford Davies, Vaughan Williams, Holst, and Walton conducted their own works. Atkins himself conducted Strauss's <span class="italic">Tod und Verkl&auml;rung</span> in 1902, as well as pieces by Wagner (act <span class="smallcap">III</span> of <span class="italic">Parsifal</span>, in the cathedral, raised eyebrows in 1911), Kod&aacute;ly (repeatedly), and Szymanowski. However, he drew the line at Walton's <span class="italic">Belshazzar's Feast</span> and prevented its inclusion in any Three Choirs programme during his lifetime.<br>
<br>One of Atkins's talents was fitting original English texts back to great music suffering from mediocre translations. Thus he restored the words of the King James <span class="roman">Bible</span> to his editions of Bach's <span class="roman">St Matthew passion</span> (to which he persuaded Elgar to append his name as co-editor in 1911) and <span class="roman">St John passion</span> (1929) and Brahms's <span class="italic">German Requiem</span> (1947). At his last Worcester festival in 1948 Atkins conducted Debussy's <span class="italic">The Blessed Damozel</span> with Rossetti's original words, which he had restored to it. He was an occasional composer, his biggest work a choral and orchestral <span class="italic">Hymn of Faith</span> (setting Elgar's choice of words from scripture, 1905). He edited the <span class="italic">Worcester Psalter</span> (1948) and Bach's <span class="italic">Orgelb&uuml;chlein</span> (1916). He published an account of the early organists of Worcester Cathedral (1918), wrote a preface to <span class="italic">Worcester Mediaeval Harmony</span> (1928), and collaborated on a printed catalogue of the Worcester Music Library (where he served as librarian from 1933 to his death). He retired from the cathedral organistship at Easter 1950.<br>
<br>Atkins became an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music in 1910; doctor of music in 1920; and a fellow of St Michael's College, Tenbury Wells, in 1921. He was president of the Royal College of Organists in 1934&#150;6. He died at his home, 8 College Yard, Worcester, on 26 November 1953, and was buried in the cathedral on 1 December. Lady Atkins, who was prominent in the life of the city and was the first woman to be high sheriff of Worcester, died in 1954.<br>
