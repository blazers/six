<span class="headword">Baillie,  Donald Macpherson</span>  (1887&#150;1954), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and theologian</span>, was born on 5 November 1887 in the Free Church manse at Gairloch, Ross-shire, the second son of the Revd John Baillie (1829&#150;1891), Free Church minister of Gairloch, and his wife, Annie Macpherson (<i>d</i>. 1932). After her husband's death Annie Baillie almost single-handedly brought up her three boys, John, Donald, and Peter, in a rigidly Calvinist atmosphere, determined that all three were destined to be ministers. The youngest, Peter, was allowed to become a medical missionary but was drowned soon after his arrival in India. Donald and his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40282/', "John Baillie (1886&#150;1960)")</script>, learned from discussions with their mother around the family table to delight in rigorous thinking, but as they encountered a broader and more humane atmosphere in school and university they came increasingly to question scholastic Calvinism and sought a theology which was more open, vibrant, and engaged.<br>
<br>After education at Inverness Royal Academy, Donald took a first in philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, and then proceeded to study theology at New College, Edinburgh, and at Marburg and Heidelberg universities, where he studied under Wilhelm Herrmann, Adolph J&uuml;licher, Ernst Troeltsch, and Johannes Weiss. He acted for three years as assistant to James Seth, the professor of moral philosophy in Edinburgh University, and was ordained in the United Free Church of Scotland in 1918. He held the charges of Bervie (1918&#150;23), St John's, Cupar (1923&#150;30), and St Columba's, Kilmacolm (1930&#150;34), before being appointed in 1934 to a newly established chair in systematic theology at St Mary's College, University of St Andrews. He held this post until his death, and established a formidable reputation as an attractive teacher of great ability and a preacher of clarity, depth, and spirituality.<br>
<br>In addition to translations of F. D. E. Schleiermacher and various articles Baillie published only two books during his lifetime. His Kerr lectures, <span class="italic">Faith in God and its Christian Consummation</span> (1927; 2nd edn with introduction by John MacIntyre, 1964) was a fine example of the Kantian&#150;Ritschlian tradition of protestant liberal theology, and also showed a singular openness to the new &#145;theology of crisis&#146;, particularly as represented by Emil Brunner, and to the concept of paradox, which was to play an important role in Baillie's later theology. His <span class="italic">God was in Christ: an Essay on Incarnation and Atonement</span> (1948) quickly became a theological classic and has had sustained influence on modern Christology in the English-speaking world, particularly with its suggestion that the &#145;paradox of grace&#146;&#151;&#145;Not I, but Christ in me&#146; illumines the incarnation. &#145;A toned down Christology&#146;, Baillie affirmed, &#145;is absurd. It must be all or nothing&#151;all or nothing on both the divine and human side&#146;  (p. 132). His robust yet modest writing was characterized by great lucidity, honesty, and spiritual depth. Like his brother John he represented the best of the Scottish tradition of liberal evangelical theology, combining reverence with intellectual rigour and passion.<br>
<br>Baillie's posthumous publications&#151;<span class="italic">The Theology of the Sacraments and other Papers</span> (1957), and two volumes of sermons, <span class="italic">To whom Shall we Go?</span> (1955) and <span class="italic">Out of Nazareth: a Selection of Sermons and Lectures</span> (1958)&#151;served to consolidate his international reputation as a creative and constructive theologian.<br>
<br>Donald Baillie played a leading role in the ecumenical movement in Scotland, where he was convener of the Church of Scotland inter-church relations committee. He was prominent in the faith and order commission of the World Council of Churches, particularly at its Edinburgh 1937 and Lund 1952 conferences. He chaired the commission on intercommunion which reported to the 1952 World Conference on Faith and Order at Lund, and he was highly regarded as one of the most eirenic and constructive of ecumenical theologians.<br>
<br>A lifelong bachelor, with a wide and varied circle of friends, Donald Baillie suffered for most of his life from asthma, and died from emphysema on 31 October 1954, significantly, perhaps, the eve of All Saints' day, at Maryfield Hospital, Dundee. He was buried on 3 November at the western cemetery, St Andrews.<br>
