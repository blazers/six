<span class="headword">Clive <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Maskelyne]</span>,  Margaret</span>, Lady Clive of Plassey  (1735&#150;1817), <span class="occ">society figure</span>, was born on 24 October 1735 at Kensington Gore in London, the fourth of the four children of Edmund Maskelyne (1698&#150;1744), a civil servant, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Booth (<i>d</i>. 1748). After the death of her mother Margaret lived with relatives in Wiltshire and attended the school run by Mrs Saintsbury at Cirencester in 1749. The Maskelyne family pursued a number of scholarly endeavours, and Margaret's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18266/', "Nevil Maskelyne")</script> later became astronomer royal. From an early age Margaret herself developed a close interest in astronomy, music, and poetry, and at school she became proficient in the French language. The Maskelyne family also had strong connections with the East India Company, and by the late 1740s Margaret's brother Edmund was stationed at Madras, where he became a close friend of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5697/', "Robert Clive (1725&#150;1774)")</script>. In 1751 Edmund encouraged Margaret to sail to India after Clive, according to legend, had become captivated by her beauty as represented in a miniature portrait. By the time Margaret arrived in India in 1752, Clive had become a military hero and, after a six-month courtship, the couple were married at Madras on 18 February 1753. A month later Margaret and her new husband sailed for Britain.<br>
<br>The course of the Clives' marriage was determined by two further periods of service undertaken by Robert in India. On the first occasion, between 1755 and 1760, Robert was accompanied by Margaret, who gave him devoted and affectionate company as he established the British military and political position in Bengal. The Clives returned to Britain in 1760, fabulously wealthy and much envied. In spite of Robert's best efforts, however, the Clives were not fully accepted into polite society, which was deeply suspicious of the new wealth accumulated by company &#145;nabobs&#146;. Their time together was often devoted to music and they were regular attenders at concerts and operatic events. When Robert, now Baron Clive of Plassey, was reappointed as governor of Bengal in 1764, Margaret, who was pregnant, stayed in Britain. She spent much of her time at a rented house at Westcombe, near Blackheath, Kent, where she kept a small circle of friends around her, but she also played an active role in supervising her husband's political and financial affairs. Although she lived a quiet life, devoting much attention to astronomy, music, and the learning of Italian to improve her understanding of opera, Margaret maintained a public profile when it was necessary to sustain Robert's political ambitions. She attended court in 1765, and in the same year she organized a remarkable soir&eacute;e at the Clive home in Berkeley Square, where the young Mozarts, then visiting London, appeared with the popular Italian castrato Manzuoli.<br>
<br>Robert Clive returned to Britain in 1767. Margaret then accompanied him to France for an eight-month visit the following year as he endeavoured to recover from a bout of depressive illness. Clive was also now beset by political problems, and over the next five years he was forced to defend his reputation and private fortune. Margaret remained in the background, content with the company of her four children and several close companions. Robert's actions in India were subjected to searching parliamentary inquiry in 1772&#150;3, but he eventually escaped with his honour intact. He died unexpectedly in November 1774, having suffered a seizure after taking a large dose of opium to relieve acute discomfort caused by illness. Margaret recovered from the shock of this devastating tragedy and picked up the threads of a quiet, almost reclusive existence. She lived out the rest of her life at Oakly Park, one of the Clive family homes in Shropshire, where she followed her hobbies surrounded by her extensive collections of telescopes, globes, and cats. Her interest in Anglo-Indian affairs was renewed in 1797, when <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5696/', "Edward Clive, first earl of Powis (1754&#150;1839)")</script>, the eldest of her children, was appointed governor of Madras. She died at Oakly Park on 28 December 1817.<br>
