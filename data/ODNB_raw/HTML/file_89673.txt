<span class="headword">Rubinstein,  Michael Bernard</span>  (1920&#150;2001), <span class="occ">solicitor</span>, was born on 6 November 1920 at 16 Ladbroke Terrace, Kensington, London, the son of Harold Frederick Rubinstein (1891&#150;1975), solicitor and playwright, and his wife, Lina Naomi, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lowy. Educated at St Paul's School, he served in the Royal Engineers and then the Royal Artillery throughout the Second World War. Demobilized as a captain he studied law before joining the family firm of Rubinstein, Nash &amp; Co in 1948. He remained with the firm (subsequently Rubinstein, Callingham, then Rubinstein, Callingham, Polden and Gale), specializing in defending the interests of publishers and authors, until he retired in 1994. His military service left him with hearing in only one ear but his lifelong commitment to music and the education of young musicians was unabated. He was a director of Youth and Music and a governor of the Purcell School, and successively a trustee, chairman, and vice-president of the Society for the Promotion of New Music. With characteristic irony, his book about music was entitled <span class="italic">Music to my Ear</span> (1985). On 1 July 1955 he married (Edna) Joy Smith Douthwaite (<i>b</i>. 1927/8), a ballet dancer and teacher (under the name Joy Boulter), and daughter of George Smith Douthwaite, electrical engineer. There were two sons and two daughters of the marriage.<br>
<br>Rubinstein was best known for representing the leading publishing houses of his era, including Chatto and Windus, Sidgwick and Jackson, Hodder and Stoughton, Jonathan Cape, Victor Gollancz, and Penguin, then independent companies yet to be swallowed up by publishing conglomerates. His most notable triumph was his successful defence in 1960 of Penguin Books when the latter was prosecuted under the <span class="roman">Obscene Publications Act</span> (1959) for publishing the unexpurgated text of D. H. Lawrence's <span class="italic">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span>. This was the first prosecution of a novel under an ostensibly liberalizing act of parliament to amend the law of obscenity and to protect literature. While the prosecution floundered in a time warp of witnesses cheerfully asserting that they did not have to read the book to know it was obscene, and prosecuting counsel asking the jury whether they would want their maidservants or wives to read the book, Rubinstein concentrated on rallying the literary establishment to prove that its publication was justified in the public interest. Thirty-five witnesses testified to its merits. Rubinstein had the delicate task of finding a sexually unimpeachable female witness who could testify that she had read the book and remained uncorrupted. Penguin's triumphant acquittal signified an end to such prosecutions of books where a defence of literary merit could be raised. Within a year Rubinstein's grateful clients, Penguin, had sold two million of one of Lawrence's lesser works. The outcome gave particular satisfaction to Rubinstein since his father's defence thirty years previously of <span class="italic">The Well of Loneliness</span> by Radclyffe Hall, a novel with lesbian themes, had failed. Rubinstein deposited the papers from the <span class="italic">Lady Chatterley</span> trial at Bristol University, and the trial was the subject of a number of books and articles on censorship.<br>
<br>In 1962 Rubinstein successfully defended book publishers against an attempt by the registrar of restrictive practices to abolish the net book agreement. The agreement had been in operation since 1900, allowing the book trade to fix the price at which books had to be sold to the British public&#151;a measure then felt by the majority of the publishing industry to safeguard small bookshops, and to enable the publication of a more eclectic range of quality books. It collapsed over thirty years later when major publishers withdrew. In 1997 the restrictive practices court found the agreement to be against the public interest. The ending of the agreement strengthened large book store chains, but led to the closure of many small independent bookshops.<br>
<br>Rubinstein also defended many publishers against an increasing tide of libel actions. Most notable was the scornful dismissal by an English jury in 1964 of a claim by Dr Wladislaw Dering against Leon Uris and his publishers William Kimber for the account in Uris's <span class="italic">Exodus</span> of Dering's experiments on prisoners at Auschwitz. The trial lasted eighteen days and Rubinstein assembled twenty-two witnesses. As the book had exaggerated the number of such experiments, Uris was found guilty of libel, but Dering was awarded a contemptuous half a penny in damages. He had to pay &pound;20,000 costs but had paid only &pound;3000 when he died a year later. Rubinstein estimated that the action cost ten times what it would have cost to settle out of court, but insisted that it had to be defended on principle. It was a set-back for opportunist plaintiffs and deterred many such claims in the next decade. Rubinstein cared strongly about the balance to be struck between freedom of speech and protection of reputation, and his knowledge of libel laws led to him being appointed a member of the lord chancellor's committee on defamation from 1971 to 1974. The committee's sensible suggestions for reform were eventually incorporated into the <span class="roman">Defamation Act</span> (1986). Rubinstein wrote about the shortcomings of libel law in his book <span class="italic">Wicked, Wicked Libels</span> (1972).<br>
<br>Rubinstein found himself in the public eye in 1979 when he held a press conference for the surveyor of the queen's pictures, Sir Anthony Blunt, when the latter was unmasked as the &#145;fourth man&#146; in the Cambridge spy ring centred round Kim Philby. Upset by newspaper reports about him, Blunt asked Rubinstein if he had any legal recourse. Rubinstein wisely advised that he had destroyed his good name and had no chance of successfully bringing proceedings.<br>
<br>Rubinstein's wide range of interests produced large numbers of haikus, an even larger number of letters to the broadsheet newspapers, and lively conversation at the Garrick. As a young man he had frequently spent weekends at Great Amwell, Hertfordshire, studying the works of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky with Maurice Nicoll. In later life he listed amongst his recreations &#145;experiencing right hemisphere mentation&#146; and &#145;ruminating&#146;  (<span class="italic">WW</span>). He wrote a number of esoteric monographs on subjects dear to his heart, including <span class="italic">Nasrudrin on his Toes and Other Feats</span> (1999, on Sufism) and <span class="italic">The Cart-Ruts on Malta and Gozo</span> (1984). A man of Judaeo-Christian outlook, he was honorary secretary of a Jewish society to aid Arab refugees. He died on 12 January 2001 at the Lister Hospital, Stevenage (near his home in Benington, Hertfordshire), of multi-organ failure. He was survived by his wife, Joy, and their four children.<br>
