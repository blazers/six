<span class="headword">Murdoch,  William Lloyd</span>  (1854&#150;1911), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, was born at Sandhurst (later renamed Bendigo), Victoria, Australia, on 18 October 1854. He was the son of Gilbert William Lloyd Murdoch (1826&#150;1854), at one time a corporal in the United States army, and his wife, Edith Susan Hogg. His father, of Scottish ancestry, had emigrated from Maryland to Australia in 1849. After being educated at Dr Bromley's school in Ballarat and at Bonwick School, Melbourne, Murdoch moved to Sydney, New South Wales, where he was articled to a solicitor and subsequently practised until 1891.<br>
<br>Murdoch made his d&eacute;but as a cricketer for New South Wales in 1875 and made nineteen appearances for the state until 1884. Against Victoria at Sydney in 1882 he made 321. He was selected for Australia in what was retrospectively seen as the second test match to be played against England, at Melbourne in 1877. In the following year he toured England as a wicket-keeper and batsman. In 1880 he made the first of four tours to England as the Australian captain, heading the batting averages on each occasion and doing much to sustain the reputation he had acquired in Australia in the 1880s as the &#145;W. G. Grace of Australia&#146;. In the first test played in England, at the Oval in 1880, he carried his bat for 153 not out in Australia's second innings. Australia had followed on 271 runs behind and Murdoch's contribution reduced the margin of defeat to five wickets. His outstanding innings on the 1882 tour was 286 not out against Sussex. On his third tour as captain, in 1884&#151;again against England&#151;he made 211 at the Oval, the first double-century in a test match.<br>
<br>In 1879 the family firm for which he worked was dissolved and Murdoch was declared bankrupt with debts of &pound;775. He had, nevertheless, been able to embark on his cricket tours to England, and his marriage (on 8 December 1884) to Jemima Watson (<i>d</i>. 1917), daughter of a wealthy goldmine owner from Bendigo, gave him financial security. In 1888&#150;9 he paid an extended visit to England and, on his return, was the choice of the players&#151;but not the press&#151;to captain Australia for a fourth time. The 1890 tour was a &#145;failure&#146; but &#145;it would be wrong to say that he (himself) failed&#146;, reported <span class="italic">Wisden</span>.<br>
<br>Immediately after returning home Murdoch took the decision to move permanently to England with his family. Thanks to his wife he enjoyed financial independence. He knew the country well and was encouraged by his friend W. G. Grace. He disliked the vicious attacks being made on players&#151;and especially on himself for being past his best&#151;by an increasingly savage Australian press. Finally, he simply wanted to play cricket at first-class level for a few more years. While awaiting qualification for Sussex, he toured South Africa in the winter of 1891&#150;2 and his appearance for England at Cape Town in March 1892 gave him the distinction (again retrospectively)&#151;of playing test cricket for two countries. The match represented his only performance at test match level as a wicket-keeper, since that position had been filled in the Australian team during his career by J. McC. Blackham.<br>
<br>Murdoch captained Sussex from 1893 to 1899, and under his leadership the county's fortunes revived. His best scores during this period were 226 against Cambridge University at Hove (1895) and 172 against Hampshire at Southampton (1894). But with increasing years and weight his batting deteriorated. He subsequently played first-class cricket (1901&#150;4) for the London County Cricket Club founded by W. G. Grace at the Crystal Palace, making several good scores against first-class counties, including 155 against Lancashire at Old Trafford in 1903. His last important score was 140 at the Oval in 1904, when he played as substitute for the Gentlemen against the Players. His being invited to join the side on the second day, after a player had dropped out through injury, was held by the MCC to be contrary to the laws but no action was taken by the authorities. Of fine physique, Murdoch was an orthodox and correct batsman who played with a straight bat. He had a wide range of strokes, especially the off-drive and the cut. As a batsman he was excelled only by W. G. Grace on hard, true pitches, and by few in defence on soft, treacherous wickets. As a captain he was a resourceful tactician. His second &#145;career&#146;, from 1893 onwards, enabled him to compile nearly 17,000 runs besides securing 243 dismissals as a wicket-keeper. In his London county days he usually opened the batting with Grace, the two great veterans of nineteenth-century cricket in Australia and England playing out their last years together.<br>
<br>Murdoch was a genial, good-tempered man whom C. B. Fry called &#145;genuinely and unaffectedly amusing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oxford Companion to Australian Sport</span>, 1992, 732). Contemporaries recognized his relaxed and easy manner. He died on 18 February 1911, during a test match between Australia and South Africa at Melbourne. During the lunch interval that day he suffered a stroke, from which he died without recovering consciousness. His body was returned to England, and was interred at Kensal Green cemetery, London, on 18 May 1911; his wife and five children survived him.<br>
