</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pengelly, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1675&#150;1730), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the son of Thomas Pengelly, of Cheshunt, and his wife, Rachel (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1660&#150;1715), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Jeremy Baines, a parliamentary officer during the civil war. His father was a wealthy merchant trading to the eastern Mediterranean and the Atlantic seaboard, with considerable property in London's East End and in Finchley, as well as in Hertfordshire. The future judge was certainly born at his house in Moorfields on 16 May 1675; but the family seat of Churchgate in Cheshunt subsequently provided a refuge for the former protector Richard Cromwell, who continued to board there with Mrs Pengelly after his host's death, and this association inspired a legend that the younger Pengelly was Richard's illegitimate son.<br>
<br>As a youth Thomas showed an aptitude for study. In 1691 he became clerk to a London attorney, and a year later, at the age of seventeen, he was admitted to the Inner Temple, where he was called to the bar on 24 November 1700. There is no evidence as to his early practice, but after only ten years at the bar he was created a serjeant-at-law. By 1720 he was certainly among the foremost advocates in Westminster Hall, being an acknowledged expert in the law of corporations, which in this period of party strife brought him much business in king's bench <i>quo warranto</i> proceedings about parliamentary boroughs, as well as a mass of cases for opinion. He does not seem to have appeared much in equity: many decades later a pamphlet alleged that he abandoned practice in chancery because of the partiality shown by the lord chancellor, Parker, towards the young Philip Yorke, afterwards Lord Chancellor Hardwicke. But although the story is plausible (Parker was inclined to favouritism), the author was hostile to Hardwicke, and his account is not corroborated by any contemporary witness. Indeed, Pengelly's counselling work was wide-ranging: his surviving correspondence shows that by 1717 he had become principal legal adviser to the duke of Somerset, and in the 1720s he was also counsel to the duchess of Marlborough, whom he represented in litigation arising out of the Blenheim estate. On 1 May 1719 he was knighted and chosen by Parker to succeed Sir Thomas Powys as the king's prime serjeant, and in that capacity he helped to conduct the trial of the Jacobite Christopher Layer for high treason during January and February 1722.<br>
<br>Upon Somerset's nomination in 1717 Pengelly was elected member of parliament for Cockermouth in Cumberland, defeating another lawyer and future judge, the former tory and government candidate Sir Robert Raymond. In parliament his activity tended to parallel his profession. He was most prominent in the aftermath of the South Sea crash and in pursuing other issues of corruption associated with commerce and law. He took a strong line against the delinquent South Sea directors, and was active in the subsequent committee of inquiry, while outside the Commons his reputation inspired a steady stream of cases from companies and projectors anxious to avoid the <span class="roman">Bubble Act</span> passed to inhibit speculative joint-stock ventures. In 1725, when it became clear that the financial ramifications of the crash had precipitated the failure of several masters in chancery who had invested suitors' money to recoup the high cost of purchasing their places from Lord Chancellor Macclesfield, Pengelly was active in promoting the chancellor's impeachment. He was subsequently one of the principal managers for the Commons at the trial: on the tenth day he replied to the legal points raised by the defence, arguing that sale of the offices violated common law and several statutes, and insisted that Macclesfield had consciously and corruptly used the power and authority of his office to extort money for his own benefit. One of his final acts in parliament, in February and May 1726, was to assist in the expulsion from the Commons of John Ward, a swindling businessman whom he had prosecuted for defrauding the duke of Buckingham.<br>
<br>As the leading common lawyer of his generation Pengelly had legitimate expectations of promotion to the top of his profession. But although he supported the government in parliament over major issues such as the repeal of the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity Act</span> and the <span class="roman">Schism Act</span>, and spoke for the abortive <span class="roman">Peerage Bill</span>, it was difficult to navigate safely through the tortuous politics of the time. And after 1720, when Sir Robert Walpole and his allies began to fill the highest offices of state with their own creatures, his association with the independent Somerset was an impediment to his prospects of gaining the politically sensitive place of chief justice in king's bench. In 1723 he was earmarked for a second-rate judicial post: the duke of Newcastle wrote that if he would accept a vacant puisne judgeship &#145;he would be cheaply provided for, and the making him a Judge would be right &hellip; that he may not do more hurt in another place&#146;  (Newcastle to Townsend, 1 Nov 1723, BL, Add. MS 32686, fol. 384). In the event the experience of being passed over for the chief justiceship in king's bench on the death of Sir John Pratt (in 1725) pushed him into association with Sir William Pulteney and the opposition whigs, but on 16 October 1726 he was appointed to succeed Sir Geoffrey Gilbert as lord chief baron of the exchequer&#151;a post with no political influence. At the time both Somerset and Pulteney encouraged him to hope still for higher promotion, but after less than four years in the exchequer he succumbed to gaol fever, contracted from prisoners in court at the Lent assizes in Taunton. He died at Blandford in Dorset, on 14 April 1730, and was buried in the Temple Church on 29 April.<br>
<br>At a time when it was fashionable to condemn lawyers for self-serving avarice Pengelly was exceptional for attracting comments from people high and low about his honesty, independence, and altruism. Indeed, although he built himself a new mansion at Cheshunt, he died unmarried and childless, and there are hints of asceticism about his personality. A life published shortly after his death maintained that he sacrificed leisure hours and company to ensure that he was thoroughly prepared to represent his clients, and he certainly appeared gratis for poor suitors, or in deserving causes. The truth of this characterization is also supported by the evidence of his will, which bequeathed &pound;2890 for the discharge of poor prisoners on the western circuit and in London. After setting aside other sums for the duke of Somerset and the duchess of Marlborough he left his estates in Hertfordshire and Hampshire and the remainder of his personal property to his clerk, John Webb.<br>
