<span class="headword">Quinton,  James Wallace</span>  (1834&#150;1891), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born on 7 October 1834 in Enniskillen, the son of William Quinton, a wine merchant in the town. Richard Frith Quinton (1849&#150;1934), criminologist and governor of Holloway prison, was his younger brother. Quinton was educated at Enniskillen Royal School and Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1853. In 1856 he joined the Bengal civil service.<br>
<br>Quinton spent most of his career in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh. On 20 March 1865, while stationed at Meerut, he married Pauline May, daughter of Francis Drummond, with whom he had two children, Francis William Drummond (<i>b</i>. 1865) and Anna Henrietta Drummond (<i>b</i>. 1867). In April 1875 he was appointed officiating judicial commissioner of British Burma, but returned to the North-Western Provinces and Oudh in March 1877 to become magistrate of Allahabad. In November 1878, after three months on the North-Western Provinces famine commission, he became officiating commissioner of Jhansi division, an appointment which was confirmed in April 1880. A supporter of Lord Ripon's plans for local self-government, he readily accepted an appointment in 1883 to the governor-general's legislative council, a position he again held in 1889. In June 1885 he became junior member of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh board of revenue and thereafter twice served, in 1886 and 1889, on the lieutenant-governor's council. He was a member of the public service commission of 1886 and in 1889 chaired an inquiry into the administrative structure of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh. In 1887 he was gazetted CSI and in October 1889, after thirty-three years' service, he was appointed chief commissioner of Assam.<br>
<br>Quinton knew little of Assam and was given its top job purely on the basis of his seniority in the service, a fact which provoked much criticism in the wake of the disaster which overtook him in the state of Manipur. Manipur's ruling family was loyal to the British, but in return expected military aid to help them repel rivals for the throne. When, in the 1880s, British aid dried up, Tikendrajit, the state's commander-in-chief and most able brother of Raja Sura Chandra, began to doubt the value of the alliance. Instead of openly opposing the British, however, Tikendrajit befriended the young political agent Frank St Clair Grimwood. Thus, in September 1880, when Tikendrajit staged a palace coup, Grimwood obligingly hurried Sura Chandra into exile and persuaded Quinton to leave Tikendrajit and his new regent, Kula Chandra, in power.<br>
<br>In March 1891, after six months of dithering, the governor-general's council in Calcutta dispatched Quinton to Manipur with instructions to recognize Kula Chandra as raja in return for greater submission to the British. Tikendrajit was to be banished. Accompanied by Colonel Skene and 400 Gurkhas, Quinton arrived at the Manipur residency on 22 March 1891 and immediately called a durbar, at which it was his intention to have Tikendrajit seized. Not surprisingly, Tikendrajit refused the bait and on 24 March Quinton ordered his men to attack the fort and seize him. The battle was horribly lopsided and within hours the British were besieged within the residency. Rejecting the option of retreat, Quinton decided to negotiate for peace and that evening, along with Grimwood, Skene, and two other British officers, he entered the fort. The talks failed, however, and on attempting to return to the residency Quinton and his companions were set upon by an angry crowd. Grimwood was speared to death almost immediately, but the others managed to scramble back into the fort. Tikendrajit apparently gave orders for them to be protected, but the crowd continued to clamour for blood and during the night they were led out to their execution.<br>
<br>British revenge was thorough. A month later 8000 soldiers entered Manipur and seized the fort. Quinton's body, along with those of his companions, was recovered and buried with military honours in the residency cemetery on 30 April. In the following months Tikendrajit and his leading general, Thangal, were tried and hanged and an infant raja from a rival family was installed on the throne.<br>
<br>In Britain the affair provoked popular outrage reminiscent of 1857, but although in public official criticism of Quinton was muted, in private many old India hands believed that he had paid the price of diplomatic inexperience. His widow and mother were awarded pensions.<br>
