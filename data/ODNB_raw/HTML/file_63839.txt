<span class="headword">Stenhouse,  Lawrence Alexander</span>  (1926&#150;1982), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 29 March 1926 at 17 East Avenue, Burnage, Manchester, the son of Lawrence Drummond Stenhouse, jute manufacturer's representative, and his wife, Joanna Fraser Henderson. He was educated at Manchester grammar school and at St Andrews University, where he read English and graduated with a second-class degree in 1951. He later studied for his MEd at Glasgow University (first-class degree and William Boyd prize in education, 1956). From 1951 until 1956 he taught in multilateral secondary schools in Glasgow and Dunfermline. In 1957 he became staff tutor in psychology and secondary education at the Durham University Institute of Education until 1963, when he returned to Scotland as head of the education department at Jordanhill College of Education, Glasgow. In September 1967 he became director of the Humanities Curriculum Project (HCP), funded by the Nuffield Foundation and Schools Council (1967&#150;72), which was at first based at Philippa Fawcett College, London.<br>
<br>In 1970 Stenhouse moved to the University of East Anglia, and established the Centre for Applied Research in Education which developed research in curriculum and evaluation and an innovative masters degree in education, as well as continuing with HCP until 1972. He became professor of education at the University of East Anglia in 1978 and remained in post until his death. He was married on 5 September 1949 to Evelyn Annie, a clerk, daughter of William M'Lean Ross, wholesale stationer. They had one son and two daughters; he separated from his wife in 1969.<br>
<br>As an educator Stenhouse was very much a product of the Enlightenment, but his humanist and rationalist ideals were fused with his own educational experiences. His main ambition was to improve the educational process for the majority who, he believed, were sold short by the system. He saw that, after secondary education for all was introduced, the need was not simply to extend the existing curriculum to a higher proportion of students, but to transform the teacher&#150;pupil relationship.<br>
<br>Stenhouse was an original thinker who deserved to reach a wide audience and readership. In general his ideas were based on his own thinking and experience rather than the ideas of others. But there were some important exceptions&#151;for example, he frequently acknowledged his debt to the philosopher R. S. Peters (especially to <span class="italic">Ethics and Education</span>, 1966). He was also impressed by some aspects of the work of the American psychologist Jerome Bruner (especially <span class="italic">The Process of Education</span>, 1965, and <span class="italic">Toward a Theory of Instruction</span>, 1966), although he was critical of some aspects of Bruner's famous curriculum project, &#145;Man: a course of study&#146;. Stenhouse wanted to be seen as a curriculum theorist rather than a sociologist, psychologist, or philosopher.<br>
<br>The first of Stenhouse's major publications was <span class="italic">Culture and Education</span> (1967). Like much of his work, it was a mixture of new theory and direct practical experience. Some of the book is based on his own teaching in Scottish schools and reflects his love of literature and his concern for the historical. He also brought to curriculum studies, for the first time in the United Kingdom, an anthropological dimension which was later to prove of considerable significance.<br>
<br>From 1967 to 1972 Stenhouse was almost completely preoccupied with HCP. It was a remarkable project which, unfortunately, did not survive the financial cuts of the later 1970s, and the anti-professional political campaigns of the 1980s. His ideas about &#145;humanities in school&#146; were derived partly from the kind of sixth-form general studies he had himself enjoyed as a pupil at Manchester grammar school. What he wanted to do was to make that kind of humanities and discussion-based learning available not just to an &eacute;lite few, but to all pupils. Hence his early rejection of the official brief for HCP&#151;that it should be designed for the average and below average. He retained his view that raising the school leaving age gave schools an opportunity to present <i>all</i> young people with a curriculum which was relevant and worthwhile. If the HCP did eventually fail in some respects, it failed not because of lack of planning or vision, but because successful implementation of the project would have been too costly for the 1970s and 1980s. If a broader view is taken, however, HCP must be regarded as a success: after exposure to the ideas of Stenhouse and his colleagues, many teachers were led towards a new role for teachers and a less authoritarian structure for schools.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">An Introduction to Curriculum Research and Development</span> (1975) is, without doubt, Stenhouse's <i>magnum opus</i>. It is important in a number of respects, not least because it rejects the mechanistic behavioural objectives model of curriculum. At a time when the behavioural objectives model was fashionable in the USA and attracting some attention in the UK, Stenhouse was unequivocal in rejecting a view of teaching and learning which stated that the only way to organize the curriculum was to divide teaching programmes into pre-specified outcomes in terms of measurable changes in student behaviour. He carefully demonstrated that such an atomistic view was not only dangerous but was based on mistaken understanding of philosophy and psychology. The book not only demolished the objectives model very convincingly, but it set up in its place an alternative, much more humanistic view of teachers, research, and curriculum, in language which was clear and concise. It is an excellent book, which contains such quotable sentences as &#145;prophets may teach private wisdom: teachers must deal in public knowledge&#146;  (p. 4). That quotation illustrates one of the paradoxes about Stenhouse: he had the reputation in some quarters of being &#145;anti-subject&#146;, yet much of this book is concerned with the importance of &#145;disciplines&#146;; for it is by resting on the traditional standards of a discipline that a teacher can enjoy the scrutiny of the quality of &#145;input&#146; rather than being obsessed with trying to measure &#145;output&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1980 Stenhouse edited another excellent contribution to the study of curriculum and evaluation: <span class="italic">Curriculum Research and Development in Action</span>. It is a review of a number of research projects, including HCP, and remains the best account of curriculum development in the 1960s and 1970s. Stenhouse wrote the introduction and a section on HCP. But the most interesting piece of his writing in the book is his concluding chapter: &#145;Reflection&#146;. He put the curriculum development movement of the previous twenty years (and therefore his own work) into the context of the change in society, in schooling, and in teacher education and professionalism over the same period. It presents a remarkably insightful picture of the problems of education in 1980 which remained challenges in the 1990s. Stenhouse's partner for the last eleven years of his life was the educationist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98826/', "Jean Rudduck (1937&#150;2007)")</script>. Stenhouse died of cancer at his home, 80 St Clements Hill, Norwich, on 5 September 1982. His work as an educational thinker lived on after his death, not only in his writings, but in the work of the many able educationists who had worked with him, such as John Elliott, Jean Rudduck, and Barry McDonald.<br>
