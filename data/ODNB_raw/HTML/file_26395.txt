<span class="headword">Stephens,  William</span>  (1649/50&#150;1718), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of Richard Stephens of Worcester. He matriculated from St Edmund Hall, Oxford, on 1 July 1664, aged fourteen, graduated BA in 1668, and proceeded MA in 1671. The latter degree was incorporated at Cambridge in 1671, and he proceeded BD at Oxford in 1678. He was preacher at the churches of St Laurence's, Hinksey, Oxfordshire, and St Martin's, Carfax, Oxford, and served at an unknown date as a schoolmaster in Bristol. He was instituted as rector of Sutton in Surrey on 26 July 1690. His patron was Lady Ann Mason, either Anna Margaretta, the widow of Sir Richard Mason MP, or their daughter, who was then the wife of Charles Gerard, Lord Brandon, radical whig and future earl of Macclesfield.<br>
<br>Stephens preached a sermon before the lord mayor of London on 30 January 1694, the anniversary of the execution of Charles I. It was duly published with a dedication to the mayor, the Presbyterian Sir William Ashurst. In 1696 Stephens published <span class="italic">An Account of the Growth of Deism</span>, a tract severely critical of the clergy, and in 1698, in <span class="italic">A Letter to King William III</span>, expounded a whig view of the foundation of the monarchy. He was reputedly the editor of the <span class="italic">Select Sermons of Dr Whichcote</span> (1698) by the third earl of Shaftesbury, and he certainly was a regular visitor when Shaftesbury was in residence at Chelsea in 1700&#150;01.<br>
<br>On 8 January 1700 Stephens was invited to preach before the Commons on the 30 January anniversary. The invitation was backed by Sir Rowland Gwynne, but was issued only after a fierce debate in which Sir Richard Onslow, MP for Surrey, had spoken in Stephens's defence following allegations of improprieties while a schoolmaster. Stephens's sermon explicitly declined to discuss Charles I's execution, &#145;a superfluous labour&#146;, but instead sought to remove from the church the &#145;scandal &hellip; as if she has laid any obligation upon her sons in opposition to the present constitution&#146;, and to debunk the use of the anniversary &#145;to flatter princes with notions of arbitrary power&#146;  (Kenyon, 73). The tories denounced the sermon, and the Commons refused to vote their thanks to Stephens, or to ask him to print his sermon, and then voted that in future only deans or doctors of divinity should preach before them. Stephens later had his sermon printed privately. The earl of Peterborough offered him a living of &pound;150 per annum, which was refused because it was &#145;against his principle to hold plurality of benefices&#146;  (Luttrell, 4.615).<br>
<br>In December 1705 Stephens again courted controversy, with the publication of <span class="italic">The Letter to the Author of the &#145;Memorial of the State of England&#146;</span>, which was a reply to a tract by John Toland (himself a friend of Stephens). Its tone was critical of the duke of Marlborough and Secretary Robert Harley, and as such a search was made for the author. On 18 January 1706 Charles Davenant reported the discovery of Stephens, &#145;a hairbrained Whig, and he owned the book, tho' parts of it are plainly above his capacity&#146;  (Downie, 255). Others suspected of contributing to the pamphlet were &#145;Trenchard, Rawlins and his Republican Club&#146;, and even though Stephens was examined by Harley and bail set at &pound;1000, he was remarkably sanguine about his prospects of escaping prosecution. The grand juries of London and Westminster did not present him on 22 January 1706, but when Stephens appeared before queen's bench on 14 February an information was read against him for libel. He publicly apologized in the <span class="italic">Flying Post</span> on 23 March and although he was sentenced on 6 May to stand in the pillory, the duchess of Marlborough intervened with the queen and the sentence was commuted. One consequence of this action was the loss of Shaftesbury's patronage, the earl being infuriated that Stephens should use his name in an attempt to avoid prosecution.<br>
<br>Stephens continued to publish his sermons, including those in 1711 and 1712 to the protestants of Ireland, and one commemorating George I's arrival in Britain in September 1714. He also wrote the dedication and preface to Bishop Hacket's <span class="italic">Life of Archbishop Williams</span> in 1715. He made his will in April 1712, making his wife, Susanna, who survived him, sole executor; his will referred to three children, and also to another daughter, Sarah Burridge, to whom he left only a shilling. He died on 30 January 1718.<br>
