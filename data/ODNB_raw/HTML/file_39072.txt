<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Abdul Rahman, Tunku</span>  (1902&#150;1990), <span class="occ">prime minister of Malaysia</span>, was born in Alor Setar, Kedah (a Malay state then under British &#145;protection&#146;), on 8 February 1902, the seventh son of Abdul Hamid Halim Shah, sultan of Kedah (<i>fl</i>. 1882&#150;1943), and his Thai wife, Makche Menjelara. Abdul Rahman, known as the Tunku (prince), was educated in Alor Setar, in Bangkok, at the Penang Free School, and at St Catharine's College, Cambridge (1922&#150;5), where he acquired the reputation of a playboy and failed to take a degree. In 1931 he entered the Kedah government service. In 1938 he started legal training at the Inner Temple but returned to Malaya on the outbreak of war. When the Japanese invaded in December 1941, he prevented the retreating British from taking his father with them, on the ground that the ruler should remain with his people. During the occupation Japan restored Kedah to Siam, and the Tunku continued in state administration.<br>
<br>The aftermath of war was a turbulent period for Malaya. The upheaval of the Japanese occupation was exacerbated by rice shortages, racial conflict, and a crisis in Anglo-Malay relations over the Malayan Union constitution, whose provisions to reduce the sultan's authority and to offer citizenship to non-Malays provoked unprecedented opposition from Malays, who feared being overwhelmed by the Chinese. Led by Dato Onn bin Jaafar, they formed the United Malays National Organization (UMNO) and forced the British to replace the union with a federation (February 1948), which safeguarded the Malays' political position. Although Abdul Rahman participated in the struggle against the Malayan Union, he resumed legal studies at the Inner Temple in 1947. Having been called to the bar, in 1949 he joined the Kedah legal department, later transferring to the federal legal department as a deputy public prosecutor.<br>
<br>Shortly after the resolution of the crisis in Anglo-Malay relations the Chinese-dominated Malayan Communist Party launched an armed struggle. The consequent emergency (1948&#150;60) aggravated the polarization of Malays and the Chinese, and when Dato Onn proposed to bring them together by opening UMNO to non-Malays he was forced out of the party. Somewhat surprisingly, the Tunku emerged as his successor and resigned his government appointment. A Malay prince, the Tunku could be relied upon to preserve the communal identity of UMNO; English-educated and experienced in government, he was equipped to champion Malay interests in negotiations with the British. Like Dato Onn, however, the Tunku recognized the need to reach an accommodation with non-Malays. His approach was far less precipitate than Onn's: he worked for the formation of what became known as the Alliance, a coalition between UMNO and the non-communist Malayan Chinese Association and Malayan Indian Congress.<br>
<br>The British at first dismissed the Tunku as lightweight, and were concerned that his Alliance would institutionalize rather than bridge communal divisions. The first federal elections of July 1955, when the Alliance won fifty-one of the fifty-two elected seats, established the Tunku's nationalist credentials. He was appointed chief minister, and, after he had refused to compromise with the Communist leader Chin Peng during the Baling talks (December 1955), the British accepted the Alliance demand for independence by 31 August 1957 at the London conference in January&#150;February 1956. The elaborate independence constitution, drafted by a commission of Commonwealth jurists chaired by Lord Reid, attempted to strike a balance between the rights of all Malayan citizens on the one hand and the special privileges of the Malays on the other. In effect it confirmed Malay control of government and Chinese economic dominance. As prime minister of independent Malaya, Abdul Rahman retained close links with Britain through the sterling area, the Commonwealth, and the Anglo-Malayan defence arrangement. In 1963 Malaya merged with the former British colonies of Singapore, Sarawak, and North Borneo (renamed Sabah) to form Malaysia, with the Tunku as head of government.<br>
<br>Tunku Abdul Rahman was robustly anti-communist, genuinely committed to non-communalism, and unashamedly reliant on his loyal deputy, Tun Abdul Razak. Although he presented himself as the happy prince presiding over a multiracial society, the security of the country, race relations, and eventually his own political position were subjected to immense strain. In 1963 Indonesia launched a three-year but unsuccessful armed &#145;confrontation&#146; against Malaysia. Then Lee Kuan Yew's political ambitions and vigorous campaign for a &#145;Malaysian Malaysia&#146; proved too much for Alliance leaders, who forced the secession of Singapore in August 1965. Third, radical Malays criticized the Tunku's compromises with the Chinese, who for their part complained that they were relegated to the status of second-class citizens. Following general elections in May 1969, communal tensions erupted in violence, which effectively ended the Tunku's political career. In September 1970 he was succeeded as prime minister and party leader by Tun Abdul Razak. From 1970 to 1973 the Tunku served as secretary-general of the Islamic Secretariat in Jiddah. Having retired to Penang, he took up journalism with the <span class="italic">Star</span>, and, although he had not been noticeably squeamish about detaining opponents when prime minister, in old age he was an outspoken but inviolable critic of the authoritarianism of Dr Mahathir (prime minister from 1981). He died in Kuala Lumpur on 6 December 1990. Abdul Rahman was thrice married and his children included four whom he adopted. His third wife, whom he married in 1939, was Sharifah Rodziah binti Saiyid Alwi Barakbah (<i>d</i>. 2000). Among his many honours and titles were the awards of Companion of Honour (1961) and an honorary doctorate of law from Cambridge (1960).<br>
<br>The relatively smooth transfer of colonial power to the Alliance convinced some that Abdul Rahman was a British stooge. This taunt misses the mark, for, although he did not acquire the accolade of a &#145;prison graduate&#146; or bear the scars of a freedom fighter, and while he lacked the charisma of Sukarno and the drive and administrative capacity of Lee Kuan Yew, the Tunku pursued his own political goals, which were shaped by a shrewd assessment of the needs of Malaysia's multiracial society. Indeed, Tunku Abdul Rahman flourished as a consensus politician whose relaxed style and genuine humanity&#151;which more than compensated for an exasperating disinclination to master a brief&#151;helped him steer his country into the post-colonial world.<br>
