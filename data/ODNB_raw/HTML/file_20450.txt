<span class="headword">O'Brien,  Donat Henchy</span>  (1785&#150;1857), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, second son of Michael O'Brien of Ennistimon, co. Clare, was born in Ireland in March 1785 into a family claiming descent from one of the ancient kings of Ireland. He entered the navy in 1796, on the <i>Overyssel</i> (64 guns), in which, despite his youth, he was employed on boat service. In 1799 he was put in command of a hoy laden with stone, to be sunk at the entrance of Goree harbour so as to block in three enemy line-of-battle ships. In a sudden squall the hoy sank in the wrong place at the wrong time, and O'Brien and his men were with difficulty rescued. He passed his examination in February 1803, and a year later was master's mate of the frigate <i>Hussar</i> when she was wrecked on the &Icirc;le de Sein on 8 February 1804. O'Brien was sent as a prisoner of war to Verdun, where he remained for three years before trying to escape. Two of his attempts failed, owing to severe hardship from cold, wet, and hunger; a third attempt proved successful, and in November 1808 he, with Henry Ashworth and another companion, reached Trieste, and finally boarded the <i>Amphion</i>, from which he was sent to Malta. There he joined the <i>Ocean</i> (98 guns), flagship of Lord Collingwood. The latter promoted him, on 29 March 1809, lieutenant of the <i>Warrior</i> (74 guns), in which he served at the capture of the Ionian Islands. In March 1810 he was appointed to the <i>Amphion</i>, and was still in her in the action off Lissa, in the Adriatic, on 13 March 1811, when a British frigate squadron under Captain William Hoste defeated a larger Franco-Venetian force. In November 1811 he followed Hoste to the <i>Bacchante</i> (38 guns) and, after repeatedly distinguishing himself in the arduous and dashing service of the frigates and their boats, was promoted commander on 22 January 1813. In 1814 O'Brien published <span class="italic">The narrative of Captain O'Brien, R.N., containing an account of his shipwreck, captivity, and escape from France</span>.<br>
<br>From 1818 to 1821 O'Brien commanded the <i>Slaney</i> (20 guns), on the South American station, which then included the west coast. On 5 March 1821 he was promoted captain, though the news did not reach him for some months. In October he was relieved in the <i>Slaney</i>, and returned to England. He married, on 28 June 1825, Hannah, youngest daughter of John Walmsley of Castle Mere in Lancashire; they had seven children. In 1839 he published, in two volumes, <span class="italic">My Adventures during the Late War</span>. In conjunction, to some extent, with the similar narratives by Edward Boys and Henry Ashworth, it formed the basis for part of Marryat's <span class="italic">Peter Simple</span>.<br>
<br>O'Brien had no further service after 1821, but was promoted rear-admiral on the reserved list on 8 March 1852. He died at Yew House, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, on 13 May 1857. A memorial window was placed in Broxbourne church.<br>
