<span class="headword">Latimer,  Thomas</span>  (1803&#150;1888), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born in Bristol on 9 August 1803, the son of a merchant's clerk who, some time after 1807, moved his household to London. Following an unrecorded but probably haphazard education, Thomas Latimer was apprenticed to a printer. With like-minded apprentices, among them the future comic writer and playwright Douglas Jerrold (1803&#150;1857), Latimer pursued the self-education possible in a printing office, mastering French and Latin, with some Italian, and was caught up in Byronism and radical enthusiasms. Present in 1823 when Dr George Birkbeck (1776&#150;1841) proposed a mechanics' institution in the capital, Latimer threw himself into the new activity, but soon withdrew and became involved in a nascent gymnastic movement on the German model.<br>
<br>After completing his apprenticeship Latimer worked briefly for the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> (as a writer of jokes at 6<i>d</i>. for seven lines) and then for the radical <span class="italic">Albion</span> until the government closed it down. A walking tour of Devon in the summer of 1826 confirmed his dislike of London; settling on Exeter, he married Frances Ann Perry (1807/8&#150;1892) of London, and they served briefly as superintendents of an infant school. Of twelve children born in the marriage, the younger son and four daughters survived him.<br>
<br>Soon after his arrival in Exeter Latimer was introduced to two leading figures in the Devon County Reform Club who proposed to pay his salary while he was placed with the <span class="italic">Devon County Chronicle</span>. Latimer claimed to have been the first shorthand reporter in the county; on one occasion at the Exeter assizes he and Charles Dickens matched skills. The arrangement with the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> collapsed after a year and Latimer was engaged by the <span class="italic">Plymouth Journal</span>; in the first six months of 1830 he also edited <span class="italic">Philo-Danmonian</span>, a literary periodical.<br>
<br>On his return to Exeter in 1830 Latimer joined the <span class="italic">Exeter and Plymouth Gazette</span>, where he soon became acting editor. When his hard-hitting leaders, in the mounting excitement over parliamentary reform, provoked his dismissal, he was immediately hired by the less well-established but uncompromisingly radical <span class="italic">Western Times</span>. In 1835, realizing his value in a new age of opinion, local liberal leaders bought out the paper and installed him as managing editor. With the collapse of Exeter's ancient textile industry, the plight of the many poor residents engaged Latimer's deepest sympathies, though he had little use for trade unionism as a remedy. He sharply attacked the entrenched leadership of the city, giving point to the motto for the paper, &#145;Tempora quaeram&#146;.<br>
<br>Though an Anglican, Latimer found his choicest target in Henry Phillpotts (1788&#150;1869), an uncompromising high-churchman who had become bishop of Exeter in 1831. Phillpotts soon alienated many of his clergy and much of the population of Exeter, especially the dissenters, by his absence from the city for all but a few hours during the cholera epidemic of 1832, by his use of patronage to provide for his family, and by his intolerance of theological difference, the last reaching a climax in the Gorham controversy of 1850.<br>
<br>Latimer's genius for abuse fully justified his reputation as the Cobbett of the West. When on the scent he was not overscrupulous about fact or language. While notably strait-laced in habit and conversation, his humour and sarcasm led him to focus on personal frailties and to make outrageous play with names: thus, a high-church parson who was among the first to place flowers on the altar was ever after Flower-Pot Smith, and when Phillpotts appointed a son-in-law, the Revd Francis du Boulay, to a living, the unfortunate cleric became the Revd du Bouilli (the Revd Bully-Beef). Very much of its time this slashing style clearly embarrassed late Victorian journalists who were called upon to write otherwise admiring obituaries.<br>
<br>In the mid-1840s a long-simmering dispute between the duke of Somerset and Phillpotts boiled over. A dozen years earlier the duke had chosen James Shore, an evangelical clergyman, as curate of a chapel built to serve some new housing on the ducal estate. In 1843 a change of vicars gave Phillpotts occasion to refuse a licence to Shore. Somerset thereupon had the chapel licensed as a dissenting place of worship, but when Shore continued to officiate according to the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> the bishop brought Shore to trial before the court of arches. In a judgment on 20 June 1846, later upheld by the judicial committee of the privy council, the court refused to remove Shore but ordered him admonished and to pay the costs, which led to his imprisonment for debt.<br>
<br>Shortly after the privy council judgment, Latimer printed a full report of a speech by the duke's son, Lord Seymour, attacking the bishop, and in an editorial Latimer denounced Phillpotts as, among other things, a &#145;consecrated, careless perverter of facts&#146;. Phillpotts thereupon brought a charge of criminal libel against &#145;Thomas Latimer, labourer&#146;; overriding the advice of his lawyers Latimer refused to apologize, and the case came to trial on 27 March 1848, when Latimer was brilliantly defended without fee by Alexander Cockburn (1802&#150;1880), later lord chief justice. Phillpotts had not reckoned with the effect of Lord Campbell's act of 1843, which allowed truth to be pleaded against an accusation of libel, and, despite hostile instructions, an overwhelmingly Conservative jury acquitted Latimer, to general rejoicing in Exeter.<br>
<br>Although Latimer somewhat moderated his editorial tone after mid-century, he remained committed to radicalism as he understood it. He became an overseer of the poor and an improvement commissioner in 1849 and a magistrate in 1851. Physically active and a genial friend, he was handicapped only by increasing deafness, which led him in the late 1860s to turn over editorial duties largely to his son-in-law, while his younger son Hugh (1843&#150;1920) took on the management of the highly successful paper, which had become a daily in 1866. Latimer died at his home, 143 Fore Street, Exeter, of liver cancer on 5 January 1888 and was buried in the old cemetery on 10 January. The commemorative window in the south aisle of the cathedral, like the windows in the lady chapel honouring his old adversary Bishop Phillpotts, was destroyed in an air raid in 1942.<br>
