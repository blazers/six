<span class="headword">Maude <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Nasmyth]</span>,  Dorothea Clara</span>  (1879&#150;1959), <span class="occ">physician and surgeon</span>, was born in South Kensington, London, on 26 February 1879, the third of five daughters of Ashley Henry Maude (1850&#150;1933) and his wife, Emma Constance, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Henry (1866&#150;1889). Her paternal grandfather, Colonel Sir George Ashley Maude (1817&#150;1894), a Crimea veteran, had been crown equerry to Queen Victoria. Her father, a barrister, lived on independent means, served for a year as mayor of Eastbourne, and pursued his amateur interest in botany (he was a member of the Linnean Society); under the influence of Lord Radstock he became a stern evangelical. He brought up his daughters with the help of governesses after their mother's death. Aged fourteen, Dorothea Maude was sent to Cheltenham Ladies' College, where she excelled. In 1898 she entered Somerville College, Oxford, and took first-class honours in physiology in 1902 but, Oxford degrees still being closed to women, graduated MA from Trinity College, Dublin, as one of the &#145;steamboat ladies&#146;. After deciding to study medicine, she enrolled at the Royal Free Medical College for Women, graduating MB and BS in 1906, and MD from the University of London in 1909. After taking a hospital position in Liverpool and a locum position in the Shetland Isles, she set up a practice at 5 Holywell Street, Oxford.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of war in 1914 many of the one thousand or so women physicians in Britain were keen to serve, both at home and abroad. The War Office rebuffed female medical volunteers in the field, on the ostensible ground that it was too dangerous, and that their skills were better applied at home, taking the place of male physicians and surgeons who were on war service. This led the Scottish-trained physician Elsie Maud Inglis to found the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service, under whose auspices women medical volunteers went to assist the French and the Serb forces. Others joined the volunteer units organized by Mabel St Clair Stobart and Lady Paget. Maude went independently of these units, joining a British field hospital in Belgium in the autumn of 1914. In January 1915 she moved to a Royal Army Medical Corps unit, the Sophie Berthelot Hospital in Calais, France, where her arrival caused a stir, as &#145;a trouser-wearing Dr Maude&#146; had been expected. She was next a staff physician at a hospital for battle casualties at Dunkirk established by her uncle Alwyne Edward Maude (1854&#150;1945), after which she returned to her Oxford practice.<br>
<br>Maude's third mission was to north Serbia, in July 1915, where she joined the Second British Farmers' Ambulance Unit in Po&#382;arevac. She was one of four staff physicians, in a unit that also included a matron, sixteen nurses, seven male orderlies, and three female cooks. Much of her time was spent treating Serbian civilians in outpatient clinics&#151;typhus, dysentery, and cholera were rampant&#151;and relieving other physicians in units in northern Serbia, while also assisting in the nearby camp hospital, where she would ride out to administer anaesthetics. In October 1915, with the Serb forces in retreat, she was asked to accompany some ill nurses back to England. She set out again in March 1916 for Corfu, where her uncle had set up a hospital in the grounds of the Villa San Stefano, above Corfu town, to treat Serbs exiled by the Austrian advance. Visiting the hospital on 25 May 1916, the Serbian crown prince Alexander awarded her the order of St Sava. She moved to Salonika, where the hospital was transferred in September 1916, treating Russians, Italians, and Portuguese, as well as Serbs, in conditions where malaria and dysentery were rife. Her final move, in October 1916, was to Vodena, north of Salonika, where she witnessed the privations of the Serb exiles. In Corfu she had met (George Cecil) Hugh Nasmyth (1887&#150;1942), a colliery manager in civilian life, who was then a lieutenant in the Army Service Corps. They married there on 19 April 1917, and she left Greece for Britain in May 1917. They had a son born in 1918 and a daughter in 1920.<br>
<br>Dorothea Nasmyth returned to her practice in Oxford, and remained there, apart from a short period (1925&#150;33) when she and her husband lived at Walmer in Kent. She finally gave up her practice in 1957, on the death of her last patient, the classical scholar Gilbert Murray. She died at her home, Badgers Holt, Boars Hill, Sunningwell, Berkshire, on 12 December 1959, and was cremated at Oxford crematorium. Her diaries document the wartime career of one of a number of British-trained women physicians who, undeterred by the opposition of the War Office, served independently in the field during the First World War.<br>
