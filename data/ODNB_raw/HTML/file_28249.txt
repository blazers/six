<span class="headword">Vernon,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1824, <em>d.</em> 1872), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born in Staffordshire and baptized at Skelton, Staffordshire, on 7 November 1824, the son of George Vernon and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Simpson. He is said to have trained in Paris before returning to settle in London and study with the engraver Peter Lightfoot. Like his master, Vernon concentrated on line engraving, but, although he was highly skilled, his choice of such a narrow medium and the fact that he was rarely employed by the book trade meant that he struggled throughout his career. It was no doubt in search of security that he visited America, and worked as a bank note engraver in New York during a stay which appears to have lasted from 1863 to 1865. Vernon exhibited seven engravings at the Royal Academy between 1857 and 1867, three portraits and four history subjects.<br>
<br>Many of Vernon's most important plates were published by Henry Graves, and these included his two earliest exhibits at the academy in 1857: <span class="italic">The Infant Amazon: a Portrait of Princess Helena</span>, after Franz Winterhalter, and <span class="italic">The Virgin and Child</span>, after William Dyce. Both works came from Queen Victoria's private collection and were published, together with two other subjects, in Samuel Carter Hall's <span class="italic">The Royal Gallery of Art</span> (1857&#150;8). Graves was also responsible for commissioning other prints after modern artists, such as <span class="italic">The First Born</span>, after Charles West Cope (1865) and <span class="italic">Olivia Unveiling</span>, after Charles Robert Leslie (1863). The other outlet for Vernon's modern subjects was the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, which reproduced a number of his works, among them <span class="italic">The Infant Bacchus</span>, after Martin Archer Shee.<br>
<br>Vernon's works after old masters encompassed a wide range of periods, and he showed engravings at the Royal Academy after Rubens's <span class="italic">Portrait of his Wife</span> and Murillo's <span class="italic">Pool at Bethesda</span>. Of the earlier masters, he also exhibited <span class="italic">Abundance</span>, after Jan Van Eyck, as well as working on an Arundel Society print after Fra Angelico's <span class="italic">Saint Matthew</span> from the chapel of Nicholas V in the Vatican.<br>
<br>Vernon was elected a member of the Graphic Society in 1867. He died on 23 January 1872. Examples of his work are in the print rooms at the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
