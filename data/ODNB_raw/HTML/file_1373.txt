<span class="headword">Barham,  Francis Foster</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Alist Francis Barham]</span>  (1808&#150;1871), <span class="occ">transcendentalist</span>, was born on 31 May 1808 at Leskinnick, Penzance, Cornwall, the youngest of the five sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1377/', "Thomas Foster Barham (1766&#150;1844)")</script>, musician and writer, and his wife, Mary Ann, daughter of the Revd Joshua Morton. His brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1372/', "Charles Foster Barham")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1378/', "Thomas Foster Barham")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1379/', "William Foster Barham")</script>. A delicate child, often confined to the house by fever, he became a voracious reader of poetry and the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. &#145;From my earliest age&#146;, he later wrote, &#145;my mind was impressed by an intense love of the study of divinity&#146;  (Barham, <span class="italic">Alist: an Autobiography</span>, 5). In his youth he grew fit enough to ride, shoot, swim, sail, and keep animals. At Penzance grammar school, where discipline was famously severe, besides Greek, Latin, French, and mathematics he learned that &#145;asceticism begets energy and endurance&#146;  (Barham, <span class="italic">Memorial</span>, Introduction). Asceticism therefore became the guiding principle of his life.<br>
<br>While studying under his brother the Revd Henry Foster Barham of Epping Forest, Barham acquired a taste for collecting rare books. In 1826 he was articled for five years to a solicitor at Devonport, Plymouth. There, living alone and frugally, he read for eight to twelve hours a day. Offended by the &#145;detestable&#146; style and phraseology of his law books, he turned to the lives of the saints and became particularly attached to Thomas &agrave; Kempis. After he qualified in 1831 he moved to London in order to practise as a member of one of the inns of court. Ill health prevented him from obtaining clients, and he decided to engage instead upon a literary career. He later recalled that &#145;as a solitary student in London, very retired, pale in countenance and toil worn in body, I seemed to exist for mind alone&#146;  (Barham, <span class="italic">Alist: an Autobiography</span>, 13). Two hundred pounds invested in the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span> procured him the joint editorship with John Abraham Heraud, the poet and dramatist. Finding the occupation &#145;unremunerative&#146;  (Barham, <span class="italic">Memorial</span>) he retired after less than a year, though he continued to contribute articles whose copyright he was careful to retain. Established in a comfortable boarding house in Camden Town, he dedicated all his time to reading in the British Museum: &#145;a great love of philology was born&#146;  (Barham, <span class="italic">Memorial</span>). Among the languages he mastered were Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, Persian, Sanskrit, and Chinese; &#145;book opened book&#146; his autobiography relates, and so he came to theosophy, freemasonry, alchemy, and occultism: &#145;I gave very long and earnest attention to collecting all the secret wisdom I could from this curious department of literature&#146;  (ibid., 11).<br>
<br>Prolonged study, loneliness, and lack of food&#151;Barham lived for weeks on bread and water&#151;intensified his belief in the importance of a spiritual life. His masters now were Philo; Dionysius, the pseudo-Areopagite; Tertullian; Origen; F&eacute;n&eacute;lon; and William Law. They led him to a practical syncretism which strove to unite all the scattered truths of every religion without their errors&#151;Barham was in no doubt he could identify the errors. After very long and arduous research he at last, about 1843, discovered the supreme central doctrine and gave it the name of Alism&#151;A, Al, or Alah being the most ancient and universal title of the deity in Hebrew scripture. &#145;By Alism I meant that eternal Divinity, pure and universal which reconciled all divine truths to be found in scripture or nature, in theology, philosophy, science, or art&#146;  (Barham, <span class="italic">Memorial</span>, 12). This discovery justified Barham's fundamental optimism. He thought it would enable every living creature to attain the best possible condition according to its particular circumstances. &#145;Every man who labours for the advancement of piety, prosperity and peace, universal industry and generous recompense: he indeed is divine, he indeed is godlike&#146;  (<span class="italic">Alist: an Autobiography</span>, 19). Barham believed, moreover, that the transformation of society had already begun under the providential administration of Sir Robert Peel. After 1843 Barham began calling himself Alist Francis Barham. Later he dropped the title Alist, but he never resumed the use of his middle name, Foster  (Barham, <span class="italic">Memorial</span>, iv).<br>
<br>During his fourteen years in London, Barham wrote and edited many books, among which was a new edition of Jeremy Collier's <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical History of Great Britain</span>, on which he laboured from 1840 to 1844. He lectured to institutions and set up a literary agency near Gray's Inn to deal with authors' problems. He founded a Syncretic Society &#145;for the advancement of literature&#146;  (<span class="italic">Alist: an Autobiography</span>, 17), and a Society of Alists. He called for a return to enthusiasm, believing that, if the great religious revival heralded by his discovery of Alism were to succeed, the clergy must reform their present coldness and dullness. Among the preachers he most admired were Amos Bronson Alcott, Thomas Chalmers, and Edward Irving. He claimed to have put the Alist case to, among others, the mystic James Pierrepont Greaves, Scott, Carlyle, and Gladstone  (Barham, <span class="italic">Alist: an Autobiography</span>, 9).<br>
<br>In 1844, aged thirty-six, having been a lifelong advocate of celibacy, he married Gertrude (<i>d</i>. 1869), daughter of the Revd Thomas Greenfield of Clifton, Bristol. The couple moved there, and for the next ten years Barham's time was principally occupied with the preparation of new translations of the Old and <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in chronological order, a herculean task which he was unable to complete. As a result of his labours he suffered from constant headaches, palpitations, and hallucinations. In 1854 he moved to Bath, where he and his wife lived at 8 St Mark's Place until she died on 23 December 1869. In the last eighteen months of his life he was befriended by a neighbour, Isaac Pitman, originator of the most widely used system of shorthand, and long a follower of Emmanuel Swedenborg. Barham died of a heart attack at his home in Bath on 9 February 1871, leaving manuscripts totalling 116 lb in weight, in very small handwriting and including treatises on ecclesiastical subjects, poems, plays, and propaganda for causes including pacifism, vegetarianism, and animal welfare. He also wrote on Swedenborg's works, and penned memoirs of James Pierrepont Greaves and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. These fell to Pitman, who published less than a tenth of the whole as an example of his new method of spelling in his <span class="italic">Phonetic Journal</span>.<br>
<br>Barham's prose was as lucid and precise as his vision of the world transformed by Alism. He was persuaded that Alah, God, the saints, prophets, and angels had an actual presence and communed with kindred intelligences, but he won few adherents for his ideas.<br>
