<span class="headword">Blomefield <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Jenyns]</span>,  Leonard</span>  (1800&#150;1893), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born on 25 May 1800 at 85 Pall Mall, London (his maternal grandfather's home). He was the youngest son of George Leonard Jenyns (1763&#150;1848), canon of Ely and chairman of the board of agriculture, and his wife, Mary (1763&#150;1832), a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12855/', "Dr William Heberden (1710&#150;1801)")</script> and a first cousin of Dr William Wollaston (1766&#150;1828). On the death of his cousin Soame Jenyns in 1787, George Leonard Jenyns had inherited the Bottisham Hall property in Cambridgeshire. Jenyns's mother, as Mary Heberden, had had her portrait painted by Gainsborough.<br>
<br>In 1813 Jenyns was moved from a school at Putney to Eton College, where he remembered Edward and Philip Pusey as dull schoolfellows. He took no part in the school games, but was devoted to chemistry, and was introduced to Sir Joseph Banks in 1817 as &#145;the Eton boy who lit his rooms with gas&#146;  (Blomefield, <span class="italic">Chapters in my Life</span>, 40). In 1818 he went to St John's College, Cambridge, and took a pass degree four years later. At Cambridge he came to the attention of J. S. Henslow (1796&#150;1861). They worked together on natural history projects until Henslow's death, and in 1823 Henslow married Jenyns's sister, Harriet.<br>
<br>In 1823 Jenyns was ordained deacon by Bishop George Pelham of Lincoln in Old Marylebone Church, and next year was ordained priest in Christ's College by the master John Kaye (1783&#150;1853), who was then also bishop of Bristol. After ordination he entered parish work immediately as curate of Swaffham Bulbeck, a parish of seven hundred souls adjoining the Bottisham estate in Cambridgeshire. During the years of his curacy he never saw his vicar. The latter resigned in 1827, and Jenyns was given the benefice by Bishop Sparke of Ely. He was the first resident vicar at Swaffham Bulbeck, but in the execution of the reforms that were necessary he observed the strictest moderation, and so gained the permanent goodwill of his parishioners. He reorganized a local charity school which had got into evil hands, enlarged the vicarage house, and planted a garden.<br>
<br>Cambridge was within an easy ride, and Jenyns was thus able to maintain regular communications with his fellow natural historians. He proceeded MA in 1825, the year in which he read his first paper, on the &#145;Ornithology of Cambridgeshire&#146;, to the Cambridge Philosophical Society. From about 1828 he began regularly to contribute pieces to both learned and popular publications, including <span class="italic">Loudon's Magazine of Natural History</span> and the <span class="italic">Annals and Magazine of Natural History</span>. His diary for 1831 records that he received an &#145;offer of accompanying Capt. Fitzroy, as Naturalist, in the Beagle, on his voyage to survey the coasts of S. America, afterwards going round the globe&#146;. He &#145;declined the appointment w<sup>h</sup> was afterwards given to Charles&#150;Darwin Esq. of Xts' College Cambridge&#146;&#151;he felt duty-bound to his parish and his health was not perfect.<br>
<br>In 1832 Jenyns joined the British Association for the Advancement of Science, which met that year in Oxford. He also attended (and read a paper at) the 1834 meeting at Edinburgh. In the following year, he published two works, <span class="italic">A Systematic Catalogue of British Vertebrate Animals</span> and <span class="italic">A Manual of British Vertebrate Animals</span>; the latter work was held in high estimation as a work of reference. Before he had completed it, at the request of Charles Darwin, he undertook to edit the monograph <span class="italic">Fishes</span> for <span class="italic">The Zoology of the Voyage of HMS Beagle</span>, published in 1840.<br>
<br>On 23 April 1844 Jenyns married Jane (1817&#150;1860), eldest daughter of the Revd Andrew Edward Daubeny (1784&#150;1877) and niece of Professor Charles Daubeny of Oxford (whom Jenyns subsequently visited often). In October 1849 the state of his wife's health compelled Jenyns's removal to Ventnor, and eventually his resignation of the vicarage at Swaffham Bulbeck in 1853, when his parishioners subscribed to a handsome testimonial for him. In the autumn of 1850 he settled at South Stoke, near Combe Down, Bath, but two years later moved to Swainswick, where for eight years he served the curacy of Woolley, and for a year or two of Langridge as well. On his wife's death in 1860 he settled finally in Bath. He was the founder (18 February 1855) and first president of the Bath Natural History and Antiquarian Field Club. In 1856 at the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Cheltenham, he read a paper entitled &#145;The variation of species&#146;, a paper of which Darwin asked to be sent a copy. (Jenyns broadly supported the latter's ideas, subsequently published in <span class="italic">Origin of Species</span>.) In 1869 Jenyns was the donor of the Jenyns Library, a munificent gift of some 1200 volumes, which went to Bath's Royal Literary and Scientific Institution. He also donated to this institution his choice herbarium of British plants, consisting of more than forty folio and an equal number of quarto volumes, the result of his life work in this branch of science. He had originally extended his studies from zoology to botany under the influence of Henslow, and on his friend's death he wrote a masterly memoir of him, published in 1862 (the year in which, on 24 June, he married his second wife, Sarah (1819&#150;1907/8), daughter of the Revd Robert Hawthorn of Stapleford). The <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the Bath Field Club abound with papers and addresses from his pen. Not the least valuable are those on the climate and meteorology of Bath. It was entirely at his instance that the small observatory was erected in the Institution gardens in 1865.<br>
<br>Towards the close of his career Jenyns was held in honour as the patriarch of natural history studies in Great Britain. He was elected a member of the Linnean Society in November 1822, and in the same year was elected into the Cambridge Philosophical Society. He was an original member of the Zoological (1826), Entomological (1834), and Ray (1844) societies. He had the greatest veneration for Gilbert White, whose <span class="italic">Selborne</span> he copied out while a boy at Eton, and knew almost by heart. He edited the <span class="italic">Natural History of Selborne</span> in 1843, and one of his latest interests was the welfare of the Selborne Society, before which on 14 May 1891 he read a delightful paper entitled &#145;The records of a rookery&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1871, through Jenyns's connection with the Chappelow family (he was the great-grandson of Edward Chappelow of Diss and his wife, Elizabeth, the sister of Francis Blomefield, the historian of Norfolk) a considerable property worth some &pound;7000 devolved on him, on the condition he adopted the name of Blomefield. In that same year, aged seventy-one, he ascended Snowdon, in a round trip of 12 miles from his lodgings at Llanberis. In 1888 the British Association for the Advancement of Science met in Bath; Blomefield was vice-president. Extremely methodical and regular in all his habits, he retained his mental vigour almost to the last. By 1891 he was suffering bronchial attacks and gout, but rallied sufficiently to give two lectures in that year. He died at his home, 19 Belmont, Bath, on 1 September 1893, aged ninety-three. He was buried in Lansdown cemetery, Bath, on 5 September.<br>
<br>Blomefield's attractive personality is revealed in his <span class="italic">Chapters in my Life</span> (privately printed at Bath in 1889), a short autobiography written with the greatest simplicity and directness. It contains interesting vignettes of Charles Darwin, Buckland, Heberden, Wollaston, Whewell, Daniel Clarke, and Leonard Chappelow, and nothing that he relates is second-hand.<br>
<br>In addition to the works mentioned above, Jenyns published, in 1846, a kind of supplement to White's <span class="italic">Natural History</span>, under the title <span class="italic">Observations in natural history: with an introduction on habits of observing, as connected with the study of that science. Also a calendar of periodic phenomena in natural history</span>. Almost all the material for this was collected by Jenyns over a period of twenty years and assembled while he was editing White's book, which he was scrupulously careful not to overload with notes. In 1858 appeared his <span class="italic">Observations on Meteorology</span>. At Bath, in 1885, he printed for private circulation some highly interesting <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span> of William Yarrell and of Prideaux John Selby. A large number (fifty-five) of scientific memoirs, contributed to the transactions of learned bodies, are enumerated at the end of his <span class="italic">Chapters in my Life</span>.<br>
