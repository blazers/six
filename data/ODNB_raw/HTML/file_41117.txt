<span class="headword">Bacon,  George Washington</span>  (1830/31&#150;1922), <span class="occ">map publisher</span>, was born in New York, USA, the son of James Bacon, bookseller, and his wife, Sarah Anne, of London, and younger brother of Benjamin. Nothing is known of his education. He is reported to have started business in London in 1860 and is described as the &#145;American map publisher&#146; who about 1862 traded from 48 Paternoster Row, London, publishing biographies of American presidents and political guides to the United States and acting as agent to the American atlas producer J. H. Coltton. In 1866 the firm was appointed agent for Ordnance Survey publications, but in 1867 Bacon and his partner, Francis Apperson, were declared bankrupt and their stock auctioned off. By 1868 Bacon was back in business at 337 Strand, publishing mainly British material. By 1870 his Strand Map Establishment, of 127 Strand, was selling mainly maps and atlases, but also domestic equipment such as sewing machines. The specialization in cartography was reinforced in October 1893 when he took over the important map business founded by James Wyld the elder. Bacon was elected fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1896. He retired as managing director in 1912, but remained a director until his death. In 1919 the firm moved to Norwich Street, London.<br>
<br>In 1869 Bacon acquired from Cassells maps which had appeared with the <span class="italic">Weekly Dispatch</span> from 1852 to 1862, and used them as the basis for numerous atlases and map series of Britain and the rest of the world published between 1869 and 1907 and presented as new and up to date. Equally out-of-date material was acquired from other publishers. Most remarkably the firm published from about 1885 until the 1920s maps printed from copper plates first used in 1792. Bacon also commonly plagiarized the maps of others and in 1900 was judged to have infringed copyright. It has been his town maps that have won widest praise, particularly those of London since they collectively constitute the finest record of the rapidly expanding capital. He also published thematic town maps (particularly of London), maps of military actions around the world, and comic cartographical interpretations of military and political events by Frederick Rose and others. He was quick to seize the publishing opportunities offered by the education boom of the late nineteenth century, issuing numerous school worksheets and materials covering geography and other subjects. In his lifetime Bacon was best known for his cycling, excursion, and touring maps, published in large numbers in a bewildering variety of attractive sizes, formats, and scales. He bought in all sorts of maps from other publishers, or simply plagiarized them to create touring maps which, although occasionally excellent, were generally of dubious reliability and poor quality. The maximum life was wrung from every product and the same maps were repackaged under different titles in attractively coloured pictorial covers. When the committee on the sale of Ordnance Survey maps called Bacon to give evidence on this genre of travelling map in 1896 it recognized his position as market leader. As well as publishing maps Bacon patented and marketed pseudo-medical cures and gadgets and wrote health guides.<br>
<br>Bacon, who was a naturalized British subject, had at least two daughters and a son with his wife, Ruth (<i>b</i>. 1846/7), daughter of Samuel Stanley, carriage painter. They married at the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington, on 4 December 1869, and settled at Shelgate Road, Battersea, and then at the Ridgeway, Wimbledon. He died at his home, Woodlawn, Bacon Hill, Hindhead, Surrey, on 21 January 1922. His wife predeceased him; his daughter, Alice Stanley Bacon, survived him and was his sole executor. He was an opportunist who exploited the map market to the full. His publications were rarely cartographically original, but frequently broke new ground in format and price and did much to make maps widely available and affordable.<br>
