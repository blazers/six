<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thornhill <span class="st"> [Thornhull]</span>, Sir  James</span>  (1675/6&#150;1734), <span class="occ">decorative painter</span>, came from a family which had owned the lordship of the manor of Thornhill, Dorset, from at least 1227. His father, Walter Thornhull (<i>b</i>. 1637), was the eighth son and the youngest of the sixteen children of George Thornhull of Thornhill and Woolland; the latter, acquired in 1540, became the principal family home. His mother was Mary, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26865/', "Colonel William Sydenham")</script>, governor of Weymouth, and later of the Isle of Wight during the protectorate.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>James Thornhill was born in 1675 or 1676. The register of baptisms at St Mary's, Melcombe Regis, records his baptism there on 7 September 1675, but the entry is a later pencil addition, squeezed between the lines, and some doubt is cast on the reliability of the date by the inscription &#145;J. Thornhill Etat.57/ on this July ye 25<sup>th</sup>&#146;, on Jonathan Richardson's portrait sketch of Thornhill (BM). Little is known of Thornhill's childhood. His father appears to have been largely an absentee, first operating as a grocer or merchant in Dorchester, contracting a debt to a Sydenham sister-in-law and evading it by absconding to New England and later to Ireland. The young Thornhill may have joined the London household of his great-uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26864/', "Dr Thomas Sydenham (d. 1689)")</script>, the eminent physician; in his will, made the previous year, Dr Sydenham left Thornhill &pound;30 for apprenticeship to some trade or profession. On 9 May 1689 Thornhill was apprenticed for seven years to a relative, Thomas Highmore, later sergeant-painter to William III.<br>
<br>The earliest evidence of Thornhill's practice as a decorative artist is the date 1699 inscribed on the frontispiece to a sketchbook (BM) used intermittently until 1718. On 1 March 1703 he was made free of the Painter&#150;Stainers' Company. Thornhill possibly provided the design (sketchbook, fol. 15<i>v</i>, BM) for the ceiling of the great cabin of the <i>Royal Sovereign</i> (now in the admiral superintendent's house, Chatham Dockyard, Kent), executed by another artist and completed in 1701. Thornhill's style was greatly influenced by the work of Antonio Verrio and, more particularly, Louis Laguerre. He may have been one of Verrio's assistants in the decoration of the queen's drawing-room at Hampton Court Palace (<i>c</i>.1702&#150;4): sketches for the feigned tapestries (sketchbook, fols. 113<i>v</i> and 114<i>r</i>, BM) appear to be alternative designs for, not after, those executed, and passages of the ceiling itself indicate Thornhill's hand, although Giovanni Battista Catenaro and Nicholas Scheffers are the only assistants recorded by Vertue.<br>
<br>In 1705 Thornhill designed the scenery for Thomas Clayton's opera <span class="italic">Arsinoe, Queen of Cyprus</span> (designs V&amp;A), performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. In the same year he completed his first large-scale independent commission, from Thomas Foley MP, for the decoration of the hall, staircase, and overmantels at Stoke Edith, Herefordshire; only the overmantels survived destruction by fire in 1927 (now at Marble Hill, Twickenham, Surrey, English Heritage). More important was his activity at Chatsworth; his principal work there, in the Sabine Room (<i>c</i>.1706), is his most substantial early surviving <i>&#339;uvre</i>. Executed in what Croft-Murray describes as his distinctive &#145;happy palette&#146; of clear blues, pinks, crimsons, and warm browns  (Croft-Murray, 1.170), the scheme shows Thornhill at ease with classical sources. A drawing of the Peak Castle and the Devil's Arse at Castleton, Derbyshire (Bodl. Oxf), signed and dated 22 July 1707, suggests that Thornhill was then still working at Chatsworth.<h2>
<a name="Majorcommissions"></a>Major commissions</h2>In 1707, though still relatively unknown, Thornhill won his greatest secular commission for decorating the painted hall at the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich, a work which was to occupy him throughout the greater part of his career and to earn him &pound;6685. Arguably the most impressive baroque interior in England, it is Thornhill's masterpiece and established him as the leading native decorative history painter in a field hitherto dominated by foreigners. Thornhill concentrated on the lower hall first, painted between 1708 and 1712 or 1714. Details of the commission, progress of work, and payments to Thornhill are recorded in the Admiralty papers; on 17 July 1707 the governors of the hospital ordered that:<blockquote>as soon as the Scaffolding in the Hall is ready Mr James Thornhill do proceed upon the painting thereof, by primeing it himself, or servants, and that he make such Alterations in his designe, in inserting what more he can relating to maritime affairs. (TNA: PRO, ADM 67&#150;8)</blockquote>It is thus clear that Thornhill had submitted designs prior to this date. The evolution of the scheme can be traced through numerous sketches and oil modellos. Through an elaborate iconographical programme the lower hall glorifies the constitutional monarchy of William III and Queen Mary, sustained through maritime strength and mercantile prosperity, notably demonstrated by a great ship's stern at the ceiling's west end. Thornhill's &#145;great and Noble design, an Honour to our Nation&#146;  (Bold, 148) was publicly applauded by Richard Steele in <span class="italic">The Lover</span> (1715).<br>
<br>In 1715 the scaffolding was removed from the lower hall to the upper. By 1717 Thornhill had received only &pound;635 and, before commencing work on the upper hall, submitted a memorandum to the governors requesting further payment; but, as was to become a recurring theme throughout his career, his bill was queried. Nicholas Hawksmoor and John James, clerks of works at Greenwich, were requested to compare payments made to other artists for similar schemes, and leading artists were invited to inspect Thornhill's work. After favourable reports, the governors awarded Thornhill &pound;3 per yard for the ceiling and &pound;1 per yard for the walls, less than Thornhill had requested but, as they argued, &#145;this was the first great work he ever undertook in England, and served as an introduction to bring him into reputation&#146;  (Croft-Murray, 1.75&#150;6).<br>
<br>In 1710 Thornhill was employed by the lawyer Thomas Vernon at Hanbury Hall, Worcestershire, and at nearby Hewell Grange, near Bromsgrove, owned by the earl of Plymouth (oil sketch, Tate collection); and, as a foray into portraiture which he continued intermittently throughout his career, he painted <span class="italic">Sir Isaac Newton</span> and <span class="italic">Ezechiel Spanheim</span> (Trinity College, Cambridge). The following year, 1711, he completed work in the chapel royal and royal closet, Hampton Court.<br>
<br>On 21 May 1711 Thornhill set out on a trip to the Low Countries with the mason-contractor Edward Strong (1676&#150;1741) and Joseph Roberts (1679&#150;1742), sergeant plumber, known to him through their employment by the office of works at Greenwich and St Paul's (Edward Strong, or his father of the same name, provided Thornhill's scaffolding at Greenwich). Thornhill's sketchbook journal (V&amp;A NAL, L.1380&#150;11.IV.1961) documents their progress through East Anglia to Harwich, the voyage to Hellevoetsluis, and thence to Delft, Rijswijk, The Hague, Honselaarsdijk, and other towns to Tournai. Abroad for the first time and at leisure, Thornhill sketched and noted things of personal interest such as the decoration in Huis ter Nieuburch, Rijswijk; the dramatic mix of architecture, ceremonial, and music in the churches of Ghent; and details of the interior of Tournai Cathedral. After he left Tournai on 22 June 1711, Thornhill's text stops. On 15 August, however, he painted a set of twelve Delft plates with the signs of the zodiac (BM).<br>
<br>By 1713 Thornhill had probably completed the staircase of Easton Neston, Northamptonshire, for Thomas Fermor, first earl of Pomfret. In 1714 he won the commission to paint the bedchamber of the prince of Wales (later George II) at Hampton Court Palace, through the influence of the prominent whig Charles Montagu, Lord Halifax, first lord of the Treasury, who overruled Lord Chamberlain Shrewsbury's preference for Sebastiano Ricci, telling Shrewsbury (according to Vertue) that &#145;if Richi was imploy'd he would not pay him for it&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.45). Halifax added that:<blockquote>Mr Thornhill our Country man has strove against all oppositions &amp; difficultys &amp; now had got near the very Top of the Mountain &amp; his grace would thro' him down &amp; crush all his endeavours. wich would prevent &amp; discourage all countrymen everafter to attempt the like again. (ibid.)</blockquote>Thornhill himself keenly advocated the need to foster home-grown talent. In October 1711 he had been elected one of the twelve directors of the new Great Queen Street Academy; with Sir Godfrey Kneller as its governor, it offered through its life class a degree of informal instruction as well as professional alliance. Several of its members, for example, Richard Steele and Jonathan Richardson, as well as members of the Rose and Crown Club to which Thornhill also belonged, publicly argued for the establishment of a Royal Academy to train a British school of painters able to compete with the best in Europe. In 1714 Thornhill sought official sponsorship through Lord Halifax, submitting to him architectural plans &#145;for to Build an Accademy for Painting at the upper end of the Meuse [Mews]&#146;, the cost estimated at &pound;3139  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.74).<h2>
<a name="ThedomeofStPaulsCathedral"></a>The dome of St Paul's Cathedral</h2>A competition to decorate the dome of Sir Christopher Wren's St Paul's Cathedral had been announced in March 1709. The most coveted contemporary commission, it attracted Thornhill, Antonio Pellegrini, Pierre Berchet, Louis Ch&eacute;ron, and Catenaro. The subject matter, determined by the commissioners of the fabric, was to be &#145;confined to the Scripturall History taken from the Acts of the Apostles&#146;  (St Paul's Cathedral, &#145;Minute Book of H. M. Commission for rebuilding St Paul's Cathedral&#146;, <span class="italic">Wren Society</span>, 16, 1939). At what stage Thornhill elected to concentrate on the life of St Paul, dividing the dome into eight scenes, is not clear. By 1710 the field was narrowed to two candidates, Thornhill and Pellegrini, each being required to execute their proposed designs on a model of the cupola. Political contention between successive building committees delayed decision&#151;&#145;mighty contests and parties were made about it&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 2.125)&#151;but recent examination of events by Carol Gibson-Wood (1993) exonerates Thornhill himself from old charges of intrigue. On 28 June 1715 Thornhill was awarded the commission by a whig, low-church dominated committee inspired by a moral Anglican nationalism. Archbishop Tenison's supposed pronouncement &#145;I am no judge of painting, but on two articles I think I may insist: first that the painter employed be a Protestant; and secondly that he be an Englishman&#146; has no known contemporary source, but echoes the patriotic sentiment published in June 1715 in the <span class="italic">Weekly Packet</span>, that the committee's decision will &#145;put to silence all the loud applauses hitherto given to foreign artists&#146;  (Meyer, 71 n. 212).<br>
<br>The commissioners of the fabric stipulated in 1715 that the decoration was to be &#145;in Basso-Relievo&#146; (grisaille). On 1 May 1716 Thornhill hosted an entertainment in the cupola to celebrate the start of painting, and on 29 August Dudley Ryder, a student at the Middle Temple on a visit to St Paul's, noted that the architectural painting was complete but the &#145;history part&#146; not yet begun. Thornhill worked with at least two or three assistants, one of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3641/', "Robert Browne")</script>, reputedly saved his master from falling to his death from the scaffolding platform&#151;although some sources identify this individual as Bentley French, Thornhill's &#145;attentive footman&#146;  (Croft-Murray, 2.322). The committee's minute books record progress and regular payments to Thornhill. In 1718 he persuaded the committee to have the lantern painted, and in 1719 he was asked to paint the Whispering Gallery with further incidents in the life of St Paul (no longer extant). In May 1720 he presented to George I a set of engravings of his St Paul's cycle, executed by professional engravers chosen by himself, such as Charles Simmoneau, Bernard Baron, and Gerard Vandergucht. By September 1721, when his outstanding bill was paid, Thornhill had received over &pound;6500. A large number of pencil, ink, and oil sketches survive which trace the evolution of the scheme from inception to completion, and which reveal Thornhill's considerable skill as a baroque draughtsman. The painted hall at Greenwich and the decoration of the dome of St Paul's combined to establish Thornhill's contemporary standing beyond doubt.<h2>
<a name="Furthercommissionsandhonours"></a>Further commissions and honours</h2>While engaged on the St Paul's project, Thornhill completed various decorative commissions in Oxford. At the east end of the chapel of All Souls College he completed (by Easter 1716) a painting of the apotheosis of Archbishop Chichele, founder of the college, in a full-blooded baroque style appropriate to high-church Oxford, and in direct contrast to the style required for St Paul's. For Queen's College, he painted the ascension on the chapel's chancel ceiling, and produced designs of Queen Anne as Britannia to be executed in sculptural relief on the pediment of front quad; he also designed lead figures (positioned in 1717) for the roof of Hawksmoor's Clarendon Building. In June 1716 Thornhill was at work at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, painting the hall. In 1714 he had estimated the cost of decorating the hall, saloon, and gallery, with scenes glorifying the military triumphs of John Churchill, first duke of Marlborough, at &pound;1800; but, in the first major setback of his career, his spiralling costs so alarmed the duchess that he was dismissed, having completed only the hall. Laguerre painted the saloon for half Thornhill's estimate.<br>
<br>On Kneller's resignation as governor of the Great Queen Street Academy, Thornhill accepted the governorship, in a letter of 29 October 1716. In February 1717 he set out on a three months' trip to Paris and its environs, sketching and making notes on buildings at Fontainebleau, Marly, and Versailles, as well as buildings and art collections in Paris, in a pocket book (V&amp;A NAL, L.1455&#150;18.IV.1961). In Paris he purchased Annibale Carracci's <span class="italic">Virgin and Child Surrounded by Angels</span> (Christ Church, Oxford) and, more famously, Poussin's <span class="italic">Tancred and Erminia</span> (Barber Institute of Fine Arts, Birmingham). The Poussin was particularly acclaimed on his return. Thornhill's friend and associate Jonathan Richardson devoted extensive analysis to it in <span class="italic">Two Discourses</span> (1719). A conversation piece attributed to Gawen Hamilton depicts <span class="italic">Sir James Thornhill Showing his Poussin to his Friends</span> (Beaverbrook Art Gallery, Fredericton, New Brunswick).<br>
<br>In June 1718 Thornhill was officially recognized as the foremost decorative painter in England by his appointment as history painter-in-ordinary to the king. In October, at his house on the north side of the Piazza, Covent Garden, where he had lived since at least 1716, he hosted the annual dinner of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96316', "Society of the Virtuosi of St Luke")</script>, the oldest and most prestigious art club, to which he had been admitted on 18 December 1716 (his design for the invitation card is in the Tate collection). In many ways the period 1718&#150;21 was the apex of Thornhill's career. Other court appointments followed in quick succession. In March 1720 he became the king's sergeant-painter, in place of his old master, Highmore, and on 2 May he was knighted, the first British-born artist to be so honoured. Vertue claims that these positions were gained through the patronage of Lord Sunderland, first lord of the Treasury, as a favour to John Huggins, a solicitor and warden of the Fleet prison, and an intimate of Thornhill's, to whom Sunderland was indebted. On 19 October Thornhill was appointed master of the Painter&#150;Stainers' Company. His mounting fortune and the sale of &pound;2000 worth of South Sea stock in 1720 enabled him that year to purchase the old family manor of Thornhill in Dorset, sold by Robert Thornhull in 1686. Thornhill later transformed it into a handsome summer residence, the drawing-room ceiling decorated by himself &#145;with his head in the centre&#146;  (Hutchins, 3.675). The desire to possess a country estate no doubt followed his knighthood, but from at least 1718 Thornhill had been spending time in his native county, carrying out three commissions there: from General Thomas Erle in 1718 for the staircase of Charborough Park, interestingly signing it &#145;Thornhull&#146;, the local version of his name which he had abandoned on moving to London; he was employed by Henry Seymour Portman, a patron of his work at All Souls, Oxford, for Sherborne House (<i>c</i>.1718&#150;20), and by George Bubb Dodington, first Lord Melcombe, his neighbour in Covent Garden, at Eastbury House.<br>
<br>In 1721 Thornhill was granted the freedom of the city of Weymouth, Dorset, and presented an altarpiece of <span class="italic">The Last Supper</span> to the parish church of St Mary's, Melcombe Regis (perhaps his own place of baptism, and certainly that of his two elder brothers). In 1721, sponsored by Bubb Dodington, Sir James Thornhill was elected MP for the constituency of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis, a seat he retained until his death.<br>
<br>Other projects continued to engage him. In December 1717 Thornhill submitted fresh designs for the upper hall, Greenwich, and began work on them in 1718, completing the ceiling by 1722. At some point between 1719 and 1724 he painted the saloon at Cannons, Middlesex, a palatial house built for John Brydges, first duke of Chandos, where many decorative painters were employed. He designed scenery for the temporary theatre in the great hall, Hampton Court (1718); and he designed book illustrations, for the Oxford <span class="roman">Bible</span> (1717) and for Jacob Tonson's editions of Milton (1720) and Addison (1721). In 1720&#150;21, in the role of architect to which he aspired, he submitted designs for the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields (RIBA), and in 1721 he designed, for stained glass, the figures of Christ and eleven apostles for the great rose window, Westminster Abbey. By March 1721 Thornhill had been commissioned by the patriotic tory patron Edward Harley, second earl of Oxford, to paint the chapel at Wimpole Hall, Cambridgeshire. On 16 March Charles Bridgeman, James Gibbs (architect of the chapel), John Wootton, and Thornhill, a coterie of native talent, travelled to Wimpole together, the coach journey being the subject of a humorous ballad by Thornhill, &#145;A Hue and Cry&#146;, composed on 18 March. He refers to himself as &#145;Monte Spinosa&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wren Society</span>, 17, 1940, 12&#150;13). The colourful <span class="italic">Adoration of the Magi</span> at the east end of the chapel is evidence of Thornhill's embracement of new stylistic tastes, being a successful blend of traditional baroque movement with classical restraint and Raphaelesque gesture.<br>
<br>In March 1722 Thornhill lost the commission to decorate the king's new apartments at Kensington Palace, a project which should have been his as the king's history painter, but which was given to the cheaper William Kent (Thornhill had asked &pound;800 for one room; Kent underbid him at &pound;300). It was a &#145;mighty mortification&#146; that marked him for the rest of his life. Thornhill's personal influence diminished after 1718, when whig dominance of the board of works removed Wren and Hawksmoor, with whose buildings he had been closely associated. His own bid in 1719 for the surveyorship of the king's works antagonized many; and he had increasingly to contend with the third earl of Burlington's patronage and active promotion of William Kent. In 1730, still bitter, he described himself as &#145;disgraced and supplanted in his Royall Masters favour&#146;, attributing the decline in his career to &#145;the overbearing power of the late Vice Chamberlain Coke &amp; the present Earle of Burlington&#146;  (Paulson, 1991, 1.85).<br>
<br>In 1723 Thornhill was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1724 he opened a free drawing academy in a room at the back of his house in Covent Garden. In the same year he &#145;took a draught&#146; (ink sketch, Museum of London) of the convicted criminal Jack Sheppard in Newgate prison, as reported in the <span class="italic">Daily Journal</span> (10 November 1718). He became master of the freemasons' Greenwich lodge in 1725 and senior grand warden of London's grand lodge in 1728. In 1725&#150;8 Thornhill executed what appears to have been his last great commission, Moor Park, Hertfordshire, for the City financier Benjamin Styles. Thornhill acted both as architect and decorative painter, but Styles challenged his bill and brought two lawsuits against him, in 1728 and 1730. The courts found in Thornhill's favour. Vertue surmises that the difficulty arose, once again, through &#145;Mr Kents friends &amp; interest&#146; who &#145;no doubt endeavourd to foment this difference &amp; slurr the reputation of Sr James&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.35). In 1730&#150;32, &#145;intended as a mortification&#146; to Thornhill  (ibid., 3.63), Styles had Thornhill's paintings replaced by the Italian Jacopo Amigoni (in an important adaptation to changing tastes, Thornhill's paintings had been on canvas framed by high-relief plasterwork. The latter, also designed by Thornhill, was retained). Meanwhile, in 1726 Thornhill had completed work at Greenwich. The walls of the upper hall, which celebrated the protestant succession and the new Hanoverian dynasty, had been carried out largely by an assistant, Dietrich Ernst Andr&eacute;, a &#145;Polander&#146; recently arrived from Brunswick  (Croft-Murray, 1.263). It was completed in 1725, and was followed by the vestibule in 1726. The painted hall had been a paying tourist attraction since 1720; to aid visitors in an understanding of the complicated iconography, 1000 copies of Thornhill's <span class="italic">An Explanation of the Painting in the Royal-Hospital, Greenwich</span> were printed in 1726&#150;7, in English and French.<br>
<br>In 1729 Thornhill was granted a royal warrant to make copies of Raphael's <span class="italic">Acts of the Apostles</span> cartoons, then at Hampton Court Palace. The cartoons were revered as ideal exemplars of artistic excellence, central to current aesthetic and religious discourse; Thornhill hoped to make them the focus of academic instruction. He set out to surpass previous artists' attempts at copying them (for example, the engraved sets by Simon Gribelin, 1707, and Nicolas Dorigny, 1720). He made three sets of copies, one full-size, later displayed in the Royal Academy's lecture theatre, Somerset House (RA); one quarter-size (Columbia University, New York), and one small set (one-sixteenth), incorporating what had been lost at the hands of restorers, thus presenting what he believed to be the true Raphael. He also made separate studies of heads, hands, and feet, intended to be engraved as a manual for students. An album of more than 200 such tracings, made directly from the originals, survives (St Paul's Cathedral), as well as an album of more than 160 smaller-scale drawings (V&amp;A), several of which were published in John Boydell's <span class="italic">School of Raphael</span> (1759).<h2>
<a name="Lateryearsdeathandreputation"></a>Later years, death, and reputation</h2>After completing his copies in 1731, Thornhill seems to have lived much in retirement. In 1732 he was appointed a commissioner for the rebuilding of Blandford Forum, Dorset, and resigned his office of sergeant-painter in favour of his son John. In April 1734, according to Vertue, a &#145;violent Illness&#146; took away Thornhill's voice. Slightly recovered, on 29 April he set out for Dorset, &#145;were being arrivd. but fatigued with his journey he did not survive many dayes&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.70). Thornhill died, intestate, on 4 May 1734. The following February his important collection of pictures was sold (Cock's sale catalogue, 24&#150;5 February 1734, V&amp;A), followed on 26&#150;8 February by his &#145;Prints, Drawings, Models, Plasters etc.&#146; (sale catalogue, copy BM). His wife, Judith, whose maiden name, date of birth, and date of marriage are unknown, died on 12 November 1757, two months after their son John.<br>
<br>Thornhill's obituarist in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> proclaimed him &#145;the greatest History painter this Kingdom ever produced&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 4, 1734, 274). In his day he was an eminent public figure who positioned himself as the figurehead of the emerging British school of painting. Today, however, his importance in the history of British art curiously neglected, he is known chiefly as the father-in-law of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13464/', "William Hogarth")</script>, who eloped with his daughter Jane in 1729. They are said to have remained estranged from Thornhill until about 1731, by which time they had joined Thornhill's household in Covent Garden. Thornhill was the chief influence on Hogarth's life: in his early years, Hogarth recalled, it was &#145;the Painting of St Paul's and greenwich hospital which were &hellip; running in my head&#146;  (Paulson, 1991, 1.95). His deep patriotism, championship of British artists, antipathy towards Burlington and all things Italian, and aspirations towards grand-manner history painting were inspired in him by his father-in-law. Hogarth's defence of Thornhill in the <span class="italic">St James' Evening Post</span> (7&#150;9 June 1737), signed &#145;Britophil&#146;, is a measure of his loyalty and respect.<br>
<br>Thornhill's earliest biographer, A. J. Dezallier, admitted weaknesses in the artist's draughtsmanship, the result of a lack of sound training. To contemporaries such as Vertue, however, who considered him &#145;the most Excellent Native history painter&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.38), neither Thornhill's skill nor his prominent position in the artistic community was ever in question. Thornhill's arrogant self-confidence was noticed by the duchess of Marlborough, who &#145;never saw any great man more imposing than hee is in all that concerns his trade&#146;  (Marlborough to James Craggs, BL, Stowe MS 751, fol. 205). By the early nineteenth century, however, Thornhill's reputation had already suffered a decline: in 1813, on a visit to the painted hall, Greenwich, Joseph Farington and a group of connoisseurs, including Benjamin West, PRA, greatly admired the decoration of the hall but attributed the work to Thornhill's assistant, Andr&eacute;. West made the pertinent observation, however, that the work had undergone &#145;ill advised&#146; restoration, which had &#145;blackened the surface &amp; very much injured the purity of the Colour&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 20 Aug 1813, 12.4413). Twentieth-century critical assessments of Thornhill's ability usually commend his talent as a draughtsman but are less complimentary about his ability on a large scale, comparing him unfavourably with the great Venetian decorators then active in England. It should be borne in mind, however, that the painted surface of the majority of his surviving schemes is in fact the handiwork of a succession of restorers, not Thornhill himself. Croft-Murray (1962) did much to re-establish Thornhill's reputation, although he perceived him as working in an idiom already established by Verrio and Laguerre. His death, nevertheless, closed the epoch of grand baroque decorative painting in Britain. It is only in recent years that Thornhill's importance in other areas, such as architecture, collecting, connoisseurship, and the formulation of art theory, has been and continues to be explored. Though he holds a central place in the growing consciousness of a British school of painting, Thornhill remains the least studied of the great names in British art history.<br>
