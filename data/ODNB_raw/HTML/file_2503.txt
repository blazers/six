<span class="headword">Blackadder <span class="st"> [Blackader]</span>,  John</span>  (1664&#150;1729), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the fifth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2502/', "John Blackadder the elder (1615/1623?&#150;1686)")</script> and his wife, Janet Haining (<i>d</i>. 1688), and was born in the parish of Glencairn, Dumfriesshire, on 14 September 1664. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2504/', "William Blackadder (1647&#150;1696)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2501/', "Adam Blackadder (b. 1659, d. in or after 1696)")</script> were his elder brothers. Notwithstanding the persecution suffered by his father, the son, after receiving from him the foundations of a classical education, attended the courses of humanity and philosophy in the University of Edinburgh, but did not matriculate. He acquired at an early period strong Calvinistic convictions and strict and stern views of conduct and duty. When the regiment raised by the covenanting Cameronians (later the 26th foot) was raised by James Douglas, earl of Angus (<i>d</i>. 1692), in 1689, Blackadder volunteered into it as a cadet at the pay of 6<i>d</i>. a day. Probably through his intimacy with the commander, Colonel William Cleland, who was an old college acquaintance, he was in a few months promoted lieutenant. The regiment, by the remarkable stand it made against the highlanders at Dunkeld, played a prominent role in quelling the rising.<br>
<br>Soon afterwards Blackadder embarked with his regiment for Flanders, where he served in all the principal sieges and battles until the treaty of Ryswick in 1697. At winter quarters in Maastricht in December 1691 he was court-martialled for killing Lieutenant Robert Murray in a duel. However, in May 1692 he was pardoned by King William and restored to his position in the regiment. In January 1693 he was promoted captain. After the treaty of Ryswick the Cameronians remained in Holland with the Scots brigade on Dutch pay and were later garrisoned at Perth.<br>
<br>Following a period in London negotiating over arrears of pay, Blackadder rejoined his regiment at Perth in August 1701. Here he began a courtship of Anne, daughter of James Callender of Craigforth, near Stirling. They were married on 4 February 1702. On the resumption of war in 1702 the Cameronians were ordered to Holland and it became the practice of Anne to reside within the Dutch border towns during this and subsequent campaigns.<br>
<br>Blackadder served in all Marlborough's campaigns. In 1704 he was wounded at the battle of Blenheim, where his regiment suffered heavy losses in the assault on Blenheim village. He was promoted major in October 1705 and was present at Ramillies (1706) and Oudenarde (1708), and at the siege of Lille he was wounded twice while in command of a force of 400 grenadiers in an attempt to breach the French fortifications.<br>
<br>Blackadder also fought at Malplaquet (1709), where the vacancy caused by the death of Colonel Cranston led to his promotion to lieutenant-colonel and command of the regiment. Blackadder commanded the Cameronians until October 1711, shortly before the treaty of Utrecht, when he sold his colonelcy to George, fifth Lord Forrester, of the Scots Greys, for &pound;2600. Thus ended twenty-two years of active service with the regiment.<br>
<br>Blackadder returned to Scotland, taking up residence in Edinburgh, and afterwards at Craigforth, Stirling. He occupied much of his attention with ecclesiastical affairs, becoming an elder of the College Church, Edinburgh, and a member of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, and of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland. At the Jacobite rising of 1715, he was appointed colonel of the regiment raised by the city of Glasgow, which he posted at the bridge of Stirling to guard against an attack of the highlanders who, however, were defeated at the battle of Sheriffmuir. In consideration of his services during the rising he was, in March 1717, appointed deputy governor of Stirling Castle. He died on 31 August 1729, presumably at Craigforth, and was buried in the West Church of Stirling, where a marble tablet was erected to his memory. He had no children but was survived by his wife, Anne, who later married Sir James Campbell, bt, of Ardinglas, formerly an officer with the Scots troop of life guards. Blackadder's diaries, extracts of which together with a life were published in 1824, remain a source of information for historians of the period. Although written as a spiritual record of his experiences, they shed some light on Marlborough's campaigns in the early eighteenth century.<br>
