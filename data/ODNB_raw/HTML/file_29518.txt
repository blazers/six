<span class="headword">Williams,  John</span>  (1757&#150;1810), <span class="occ">lawyer and legal writer</span>, was born at Job's Well, near Carmarthen, on 12 September 1757, the son of Thomas Williams of that town. He was educated at the grammar school in Carmarthen, matriculated from Jesus College, Oxford, on 19 February 1773, migrated to Wadham College on 29 September, and was admitted a scholar on 23 September 1774, graduating BA on 17 October 1776 and MA on 11 July 1781. He was elected a fellow of Wadham on 30 June 1780. He filled the office of librarian in 1781 and 1782, and of humanity lecturer in 1782, and resigned his fellowship on 30 June 1792. In 1789 Williams married Mary, eldest daughter of Charles Clarke of Foribridge, near Stafford. The couple had three sons, and three daughters, of whom Mary married August Edward Hobart, sixth earl of Buckinghamshire. From 1790 Williams was the guardian of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46660/', "John Jones (1777&#150;1842)")</script>.<br>
<br>Beginning a legal career, Williams was a student of the Middle Temple. He became a pupil of George Wood, at that time well known as a special pleader, and, after successfully practising as a special pleader on his own account, he was called to the bar by the benchers of the Inner Temple on 23 November 1784. He went on the Oxford and &#145;Old Carmarthen&#146; circuits, the Oxford ending by arrangement before the &#145;Old Carmarthen&#146; began. On 21 June 1794 he became a serjeant-at-law, and in 1804 a king's serjeant.<br>
<br>In conjunction with Richard Burn, Williams brought out the tenth edition of Sir William Blackstone's <span class="italic">Commentaries on the Laws of England</span> in 1787, and the eleventh edition in 1791. Between 1799 and 1802 he also prepared the third edition of Sir Edmund Saunders's <span class="italic">Reports of Cases and Pleadings in the Court of King's Bench in the Reign of Charles II</span>, adding notes and references. His notes were highly valued and established the fame of the compilation. Contemporaries regarded them as a lucid and accurate statement of the common law, especially with regard to pleading. They were included in the editions of 1824 and 1845, and were issued separately with additions and an abridgement of the cases in 1871 by his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29501/', "Sir Edward Vaughan Williams (1797&#150;1875)")</script>, judge of the court of common pleas.<br>
<br>Williams died in London, at Queen Square, on 27 September 1810. He was buried on 6 October in the Temple Church, London.<br>
