<span class="headword">Vivekananda</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Swami Vivekananda; <em>formerly </em>Narendranath  Datta]</span>  (1863&#150;1902), <span class="occ">Hindu religious leader</span>, was born on 12 January 1863 in Calcutta and named Narendranath Datta. His family were Kayasthas, a writer caste traditionally employed in government service. His father, Vishwanath Datta (<i>d</i>. 1884), a successful lawyer, and his mother, Bhuvaneshwari, ensured that their son received the education necessary for a professional career in British-ruled India. At the age of fifteen he attended a mission school and in 1880 he entered Presidency College, Calcutta. In 1884 he graduated BA, in the second division, and went on to study law at the Metropolitan Institution, completing his studies there in 1886. He also attended the Scottish Church College in Calcutta. However, his life was not to follow the path for which his education had been intended to prepare him.<br>
<br>Like many educated young Indian men at this time he joined the Brahmo Samaj, a rationalist organization that sought to reform Hinduism, and in 1881 he met, for the first time, the Hindu ascetic Ramakrishna Paramahansa. Initially he showed little interest in the swami, but gradually grew closer to him and to his teachings. Throughout his time at college his interest in religion grew and he became a freemason in 1884. His ties with Swami Ramakrishna strengthened, especially after the death of Narendranath's father on 25 February 1884. He became a regular attender at the Dakshineshwar Temple where Ramakrishna taught, and he lost interest in institutional education and a professional career, although he completed his courses. The swami had attracted a group of young men who had for the most part been educated in English-speaking schools, and when he fell ill in October 1885 this group of disciples, including Narendranath, brought him to Calcutta where they nursed him until his death on 16 August 1886. The following month the group dispersed.<br>
<br>In December 1886 Narendranath located a dilapidated house at Baranagar, near the River Ganges, which became a crude monastery dedicated to Ramakrishna's teachings, for himself and four others, until November 1891 when with the financial support of some Hindu princes they moved to a superior lodging at Alambazar. The following year, while visiting sacred sites on the western coast, he met the raja of Khetri, who urged him to take the name Swami Vivekananda, a name suitable for a Hindu ascetic. He accepted the suggestion, and it is by this name that he is best-known.<br>
<br>From this time he became one of the most influential Hindu thinkers and publicists at a time of religious ferment and reconstruction in India, presenting Hinduism in India and abroad as a highly significant world religion, equal to other religious traditions such as Christianity or Islam. He argued, in the face of Western condemnation of India and of Hindu tradition, that India was a deeply spiritual land, in contrast to the materialistic West; and that Hinduism was a noble and ancient religion. Compared with the great historical diversity of religious traditions in Hindu society, he preached Vedanta as the core or gospel of Hinduism as a world faith; and he also broke new ground by arguing the centrality of social service in the truly spiritual Hindu life. Both these aspects of his teaching made him a compelling figure at home and abroad.<br>
<br>Vivekananda sailed from Bombay in May 1893 to attend the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago. He addressed the conference at the Chicago Art Institute on its opening day, 11 September, and eight days later read a paper on Hinduism. A forceful speaker and a striking figure, he made a dramatic impression on the audience and provoked considerable comment in the American press, including a piece in the <span class="italic">New York Herald</span> which commented how foolish it was to send Christian missionaries to the home of Hinduism. After the conference Vivekananda toured the United States, lecturing and writing extensively. He focused on four themes: bhakti yoga (the path of devotion), jnana yoga (the path of knowledge), raja yoga (the path of action), and the question of class. He gained many devotees, who would form the North American core of his religious movement. Two early disciples, initiated through the traditional rituals of <i>sanyas</i> and given Hindu names, were Marie Ibusie (Swami Abhayananda) and Leon Landsberge (Swami Kripananda).<br>
<br>He remained in the United States until September 1895, when he was invited to London by the theosophists Henrietta M&uuml;ller and E. T. Sturdy. In London he followed another intense schedule of lecturing and teaching, which met with similar success to his American tour; on 22 October 1895 he gave a public lecture at Prince's Hall, Piccadilly. In December he returned to the United States, where in January 1896 he established the Vedanta Society of New York, under the presidency of one of his disciples, Francis H. Legget. Another disciple, Miss Waldo, took the name Swami Haridasi, and taught raja yoga. Vivekananda returned to lecturing, and attempted to formalize the rituals and organization of the monastery in India through his extensive correspondence with the monks there. Back in London in April, he sent his fellow monks a letter containing a constitution for the monastery.<br>
<br>In January 1897 Vivekananda returned to Calcutta, where he pushed for greater organization and a higher degree of discipline among his followers. On 1 May he established the Ramakrishna mission, for both monks and laity, an organization which was to be devoted to social service. He sought a direct application of the spiritual life to the problems of the world; his legacy to Hinduism was the addition of social action to spiritual experience. Shortly afterwards he instituted a famine relief fund, and in the same year the mission opened a Ramakrishna ashrama at Sagachhi, and founded an orphanage. In 1898 a 7 acre tract of land along the Ganges to the north of Calcutta was purchased, and became the site of the Belur Math (monastery). Vivekananda encouraged the publication of a Bengali-language fortnightly paper, <span class="italic">Ubodhan</span>, as the voice of the movement; its first issue was published on 14 January 1899. Having brought a degree of order to the evolving organization, he turned his attention once more to the West.<br>
<br>In June 1899 Vivekananda departed once more for the United States, via London. He spent four months in 1900 in California, where he established the Shanti Ashrama on 160 acres of land in Santa Clara donated by a supporter, Minnie Block. He visited San Francisco, and sent Swami Turyananda with twelve disciples to direct the work of inaugurating the ashrama. When he returned to New York his programme was curtailed by ill health. In August he attended the Congress of Religion in Paris, after which he embarked on a tour of Europe, visited Cairo, and finally returned to Belur Math on 9 December 1900. This proved to be his last overseas journey.<br>
<br>Vivekananda devoted himself to placing the math and the mission on a firm legal and organizational footing, transferring the management of all land and buildings owned by the math and mission to a president and board of trustees. He then resigned the presidency; in February 1901 the board of trustees elected Swami Brahmananda president, leaving Vivekananda free of organizational responsibilities. He set off on a pilgrimage through East Bengal and Assam, but poor health forced him to settle at the Belur Math, where he died on 4 July 1902.<br>
<br>Vivekananda left behind a vigorous and growing movement both in India and in the West. In the West it emphasized doctrine and worship based on his interpretation of Ramakrishna's teaching. In India there were two interrelated goals: religious devotion and social service. Both within and beyond this religious milieu Vivekananda left a heroic and popular image of an Indian who had affirmed the spiritual superiority of Hinduism at the very source of material power, and amid persistent condemnation of Hinduism by Western missionaries and writers. He initiated the long and continuing succession of swamis, gurus, and maharishis who have sought to offer their own interpretations of Hinduism as a cure for the ills of wealthy but materialistic Western societies.<br>
