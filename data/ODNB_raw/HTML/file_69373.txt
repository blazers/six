<span class="headword">Unwin,  Nora Spicer</span>  (1907&#150;1982), <span class="occ">wood-engraver and illustrator</span>, was born on 22 February 1907 in Tolworth, Surrey, the youngest, with her twin sister, Nancy, of five children of George Soundy Unwin (<i>d</i>. 1950) and Eleanor Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Eady. The Unwin family had been involved in printing and publishing for several generations, founding a printing company (Unwin Brothers) and two different publishing houses (T. Fisher Unwin and later George Allen and Unwin) in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and from an early age the children were exposed to the processes of book-making. Nora attended Surbiton high school, and went on to study at Leon Underwood's studio in London (1923&#150;5), the Kingston School of Art (1925&#150;7), and the Royal College of Art (1927&#150;31). During her childhood wood-engraving had begun a vigorous revival and was used not only for the production of prints but also for book illustration. Her artistic training included various techniques, of which wood-engraving and book illustration were the most important for her future career.<br>
<br>In 1925, while still at college, Unwin received her first commission, from her great-uncle, the publisher T. Fisher Unwin, for a black and white drawing for the dust jacket for a children's book by Edith Nesbit (<span class="italic">Five of Us and Madeline</span>). Many of her engravings depict scenes from nature, and one of the early books she illustrated in this way was Charles Elton's <span class="italic">Exploring the Animal World</span> (Allen and Unwin) in 1933; in the same year she illustrated the Allen and Unwin Christmas catalogue with cartoon-like pen sketches. She also engraved prints and from 1930 entered the annual exhibitions of the Society of Wood Engravers. In 1932 she was admitted as an associate of the Royal College of Art, and in 1933 became an associate of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers and a fellow in 1946. During her lifetime she made more than 200 wood-engravings, many of which were used for book illustrations. Unwin was also a watercolourist and used other techniques for her book illustrations, but it is on her engravings that her reputation rests. In 1938 Campbell Dodgson, keeper of prints and drawings at the British Museum, chose her engraving <span class="italic">Antelope and Young</span> as the cover illustration for <span class="italic">Prints of the Year 1938</span>, which guaranteed her recognition as one of the country's leading wood-engravers. Her work after that date, done mostly in North America, only added to her stature.<br>
<br>In 1937, through her sister Nancy, Unwin met Elizabeth Yates, an American writer who was living in London with her husband William McGreal. Though this relationship was at first a purely professional one, with Yates and Unwin collaborating on magazine articles and children's books, it blossomed into a solid partnership and a lifelong friendship with both Yates and her husband. After the American couple returned to the United States in 1939, Unwin spent the war years in England, caring for children who had been evacuated to the countryside for its relative safety. Fortunately this gave her time to continue engraving and illustrating books, and with Gwendy Caroe, the mother of the children she was looking after, she wrote and illustrated <span class="italic">Lucy and the Little Red Horse</span> (1943). It was through Yates that Unwin obtained her first American commission in 1942, to illustrate <span class="italic">Under the Little Fir</span>, and in 1949 Unwin accepted an invitation for an extended stay with her friends in New Hampshire. She lived in New England for the rest of her life, with just short visits back to her family and friends in England.<br>
<br>In the United States, Unwin illustrated many more books, her best perhaps being the twenty-five engravings she did for John Kieran's <span class="italic">Footnotes on Nature</span> (1947). She also produced many engravings, and for many years taught wood-engraving at the Sharon Arts Center, Sharon, New Hampshire, and in various other schools and centres in New England. She wrote at least fourteen books for children, exhibited at Sharon and at many other galleries including the Print Club of Albany, New York, and at the Boston Atheneum. In 1952 she was elected to the Society of American Graphic Artists, and in 1953 was admitted as an associate of the National Academy of Design in New York, the American counterpart of the Royal Academy. In 1976 she was elected a full lifetime academician for her outstanding work as a graphic artist and engraver; this placed her firmly in the front rank of her profession. Predeceased by her sister Nancy in 1980, Nora Unwin died, unmarried, in Wayland, Massachusetts, on 5 January 1982. There is a major collection of her engravings at the Sharon Center, and she donated correspondence and books to the McCain Library at the University of Southern Mississippi.<br>
