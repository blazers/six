<span class="headword">Colden,  Cadwallader</span>  (1689&#150;1776), <span class="occ">historian and colonial official</span>, was born on 7 February 1689 in Enniscorthy, co. Wexford, Ireland, the eldest child of the Revd Alexander Colden (1654&#150;1738), Presbyterian minister, and Janet Hughes (1662?&#150;1731). His parents were Scottish and the family returned to Scotland the following year. Cadwallader was groomed for the Church of Scotland ministry by his father and studied at Edinburgh University, from where he graduated MA in April 1705. He decided not to follow the family clerical tradition, however, and went on to pursue medical training in London. He lacked the financial resources to establish his own medical practice in the capital and chose to move to the American colonies in 1710. Colden was assisted by his aunt Elizabeth Hill in Philadelphia, where he established himself as a merchant and physician. He returned briefly to Scotland in 1715 and married Alice Chrystie (<i>d</i>. 1762) of Kelso on 11 November.<br>
<br>Colden returned to Philadelphia after his marriage and then moved to New York in 1718 at the invitation of its Scottish governor, Robert Hunter, and settled there for the remainder of his long life. He was appointed surveyor-general of New York in 1720 and was appointed also to the province's council in 1722. Colden demonstrated an intense commitment to his belief in the importance of sound government in the colonies from the very beginning of his public career, and he shared these political principles with fellow Scots in America, such as Archibald Kennedy and James Alexander in New York and William Douglass in Massachusetts. Colden's writings, both private and public, reveal his acquaintance with a wide range of classical and contemporary thinkers. He sought to apply this learning to his analysis of the nature and function of imperial and colonial constitutional relations. Colden's thought and deeds were shaped by his provincial experience on the fringes of the first British empire. He became a defender of metropolitan and executive authority in the colonies because he felt that this was the only solution for the problems of local factionalism and narrow economic self-interest, which in his view jeopardized the public good. A clear line can be traced in Colden's political philosophy from his examination of the strategic position of New York in the 1720s&#151;which he believed to be endangered by the fur trade between merchants in his province and those in French Canada, which resulted in the alienation of the American Indian allies of the British&#151;to his staunch upholding of royal authority in the political crises of the 1760s and 1770s. Colden maintained, on the basis of his interpretation of the history of North America, and the performance of other empires that the real interests of the colonists could be guaranteed only by an impartial government in London.<br>
<br>Colden has come to be acknowledged by historians as one of the leading intellectuals of colonial British America. His interests ranged widely across the sciences and the humanities, and this is reflected in his correspondence with such luminaries as Benjamin Franklin and Linnaeus (who named the plant <i>Coldenia</i> after him). Colden published a number of works in the British Isles, the European continent, and North America, which ranged from an attempt to modify Newtonian natural philosophy in <span class="italic">The Principles of Action in Matter</span> (1751) to <span class="italic">The History of the Five Indian Nations</span> (first published in New York in 1727, then expanded in subsequent editions in London and New York from 1747). His history of the Iroquois, or Five Nations, which built upon the earlier accounts of French analysts, is perhaps his most interesting achievement for later readers in that it demonstrated that his imperialism was the product of a deep engagement with the colonial situation. He displayed a genuine admiration for the patriotism of the Iroquois, which he extolled in the language of civic humanism and which he contrasted with the corruption of both colonial and metropolitan Britons. This fascination with Amerindian liberty and customs appears to have influenced other Scots such as Adam Ferguson and Tobias Smollett, who both drew on Colden's history in their own works.<br>
<br>Colden's forceful opinions and personality meant that he was the target of a great deal of hostility in New York. He alienated leading figures in New York political society during his long participation in the bitter and rumbustious politics of the colony. He also attracted popular opprobrium during the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> crisis and the agitation that accompanied the American War of Independence, due to his position as lieutenant-governor of the province and his stout defence of the imperial government. Colden first led the government of New York as senior councillor in 1760 and was lieutenant-governor in 1761, 1763&#150;5, 1769&#150;70, and 1774&#150;5. Colden died at Spring Hill, his estate in Flushing, Long Island, New York, on 20 September 1776.<br>
