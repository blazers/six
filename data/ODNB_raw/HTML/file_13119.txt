<span class="headword">Hervey,  Thomas</span>  (1699&#150;1775), <span class="occ">politician and pamphleteer</span>, was born on 20 January 1699 at Ickworth, Suffolk, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13117/', "John Hervey, first earl of Bristol (1665&#150;1751)")</script>, and his second wife, Elizabeth Felton (1676&#150;1741). His elder brother was the courtier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13116/', "John Hervey, Baron Hervey of Ickworth")</script>. Hervey matriculated on 8 June 1717 at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was a companion in dissipation and gambling to his brother Henry, both sons causing great tribulation and expense to their father. After leaving Oxford without taking a degree he was sent to Lincoln's Inn to study law, but gave himself up to a life of heavy drinking, partly to alleviate the chronic and painful ill health which dogged him all his life. In 1722 he developed an ambition to enter politics, hoping to stand for the borough of Bury St Edmunds, a seat to which he was eventually elected on 29 June 1733, replacing his brother Jack who had taken his seat in the House of Lords. He was elected unanimously and without bribery, to the great pleasure of his father, though his complete absence during the election campaign did attract adverse notice. He held the seat until 1747 when his brother Felton was elected. His mother's intense dislike for his fellow member for Bury, Colonel Norton, caused Thomas considerable family difficulties, though the story of this antipathy leading to disinheritance is untrue. He held a series of appointments at court, first in 1727 as equerry to Queen Caroline, and the following year as vice-chamberlain to the queen's household. This post ended with the death of the queen and in 1738 he was appointed as superintendent of the royal gardens.<br>
<br>Thomas was increasingly prey to eccentric behaviour, which in later life developed into mental instability. According to Horace Walpole, when asked why in 1741 he had voted against his party, Hervey replied that he had no idea: &#145;Jesus knows my thoughts; one day I blaspheme, and pray the next&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 17.244).<br>
<br>A prominent and scandalous aspect to Hervey's life was his relationship with Elizabeth, second wife of his godfather Sir Thomas Hanmer. Considerably younger than Hanmer, she eloped with Hervey shortly after a rift with her husband in 1737. She compounded the scandal by writing to Hanmer requesting him to leave to Hervey the estate at Great Barton, Suffolk, she had brought to the marriage, an audacious demand which understandably Hanmer refused.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Hanmer died in 1741 leaving Thomas &pound;1400 after settlement of his debts. He then published a notorious &#145;Letter from the Honourable Thomas Hervey to Sir Thomas Hanmer&#146; which is extraordinary for its scurrilous and indiscreet accusations. Ripostes were published, and the affair caused a great public stir. The experience of publication proved infectious: &#145;Tom now acquired a taste for pamphleteering&#146;  (Ponsonby, 104). For the rest of his life he regularly published letters and pamphlets, with the common theme of injustices he believed he had suffered, often at the hands of his family or the courts, and which titillated the public taste for scandal.<br>
<br>In 1744 Hervey married Ann, the daughter of Francis Coghlan, an Irish barrister. She was known to be a spirited woman; one day before the marriage when the couple were in Bath the novelist Fielding, seeing them across a public room, called out &#145;Why don't you take that bold girl into some bye-place and give her what she wants?&#146;  (Ponsonby, 105).<br>
<br>The marriage is said to have taken place in the Fleet prison, not because either party was imprisoned, but because it reduced cost and official process. Thomas's father had cut off communications with him, owing partly to his marrying without the earl's consent or even knowledge. The spirited Ann lost no time in writing to him seeking financial assistance, for she was as improvident as her new husband. The request was rebuffed, but a partial reconciliation was achieved in 1750, shortly before the earl died.<br>
<br>Hervey had a legitimate son, William, whom he later disinherited. His natural sons, however, he treated well: Thomas (by Lady Hanmer) and George, by an unknown mother, whose death in 1758 at Ticonderoga caused his father much grief. The marriage to Ann palled, and Thomas began publishing scandalous letters on the misery of married life. He applied to have the marriage set aside, but this device failed. Samuel Johnson, who had first met Hervey and his brother Henry in Lichfield in 1730, had retained a liking for him, and wrote expressing his concern. Hervey published his reply: &#145;Mr Hervey's answer to a letter he received from Dr Samuel Johnson to dissuade him from parting with his supposed wife&#146; (1772). It is characteristically vituperative: &#145;Sir &hellip; you are a very good man, but you have thought fit to be an advocate for the most worthless woman that ever was on Earth&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.480).<br>
<br>Much of the intemperate and contradictory behaviour of Thomas Hervey might be attributable to his lifelong ill health. In the letter to Hanmer he comments on his physical and mental frailty: &#145;In over two and twenty years I have never been in a natural state of mind or body &hellip; I have not been in all that time out of pain, or in the calm possession of my understanding.&#146; His writing is eccentric and intemperate, but not without quality. In Horace Walpole's opinion Hervey's pamphleteering style &#145;beats everything for madness, horrid indecency, and folly, and yet has some charming and striking passages&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 38.202).<br>
<br>Thomas Hervey died towards the end of January 1775 in Bond Street, London. On his deathbed he acknowledged Ann as his legal wife. Johnson commented on his death: &#145;Tom Hervey &hellip; though a vicious man, was one of the genteelest men that ever lived&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.341).<br>
