</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Doolittle,  Thomas</span>  (1630/1633?&#150;1707), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born in Kidderminster, Worcestershire. The evidence as to his date of birth and parentage is confusing, and he could be one of two Thomas Doolittles baptized in Kidderminster: he may be the son of William and Jane Doolittle, baptized on 20 October 1630 (a date which would be consistent with Daniel Williams's statement that Doolittle was seventy-seven when he died), but he could also be the son of Humphrey Doolittle and his wife, Anne, baptized on 12 September 1633. If he was baptized outside the parish, the suggestion of A. P. Gordon in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, that he was the third son of Anthony Doolittle, a Kidderminster glover, is also possible. Nathaniel Brokesby oversaw Doolittle's early education at the Kidderminster grammar school, which met in a converted chapel of St Mary's Church. As a teenager Doolittle heard Richard Baxter, who had returned to Kidderminster in 1647 from his civil war chaplaincy, preach the sermon series later published as <span class="italic">The Saints Everlasting Rest</span> (1650). Doolittle was converted through the influence of these sermons and thereafter considered Baxter his &#145;father in Christ&#146;  (Doolittle, sig. C3).<br>
<br>An opportunity for Doolittle to live with and assist a county lawyer ended abruptly when it became obvious that he was expected to work on Sundays. Baxter's intervention at this stage in Doolittle's life proved crucial. Seeing his academic potential, Baxter encouraged Doolittle to attend university and contributed a substantial amount of money enabling him to do so. Arrangements were made for him to attend Pembroke College in Cambridge, whose master was Baxter's friend Richard Vines. Admitted on 7 June 1649 as a sizar, Doolittle graduated BA in 1653, and MA in 1656. Surviving correspondence between Baxter and Doolittle while the latter was in Cambridge indicates Baxter's continuing close involvement in the younger man's affairs, not only with respect to financial support, but also as a mentor.<br>
<br>Upon completion of his BA degree Doolittle began the search for a pastoral position and was given the opportunity to preach in London. On 14 August 1653 the St Alfege parish account book records that Doolittle was paid &pound;1 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. &#145;for preachinge fouer tymes&#146; before the congregation of St Alfege, London Wall, a parish within London's sixth classis which was then without a minister  (London Guildhall, MS 1432/4). On 13 September the St Alfege vestry chose him &#145;by a generall consent&#146; to become their minister  (London Guildhall, MS 1431/2, fol. 230). In the meantime, Richard Baxter had used his own connections in Worcestershire to secure for Doolittle a living as a chaplain in the house of a squire &#145;with an ample salary&#146;  (Doolittle, sig. C3<i>v</i>). Baxter's letter informing him of the opportunity, however, arrived after he had already committed himself to St Alfege parish. Doolittle received presbyterian ordination and began his ministry later that autumn, his signature &#145;Thomas Doelittle Minister&#146; first appearing in the vestry minutes on 1 November 1653  (London Guildhall, MS 1431/2, fol. 231).<br>
<br>During his years in London, Doolittle continued to look to Baxter for counsel and to interact with him on theological questions, particularly with respect to universal redemption. His early pastoral efforts met with surprising success, and on 9 May 1657 he wrote to Baxter, &#145;God hath given me abundant encouragement in my work, by giving mee favor in the hearts and affections of the people &hellip; &amp; others in the city&#146;  (DWL, MS 59, i:125). Baxter himself had a high regard for Doolittle's ability as a pastor, recommending to several recently converted London correspondents that they seek him out for his preaching and counsel.<br>
<br>Doolittle married Mary Gill on 13 July 1655. Her influence appears to have been felt immediately, as vestry minutes record on 5 September that &#145;It is this day mewtually agreed upon that new river water shalbe laid into Mr. Doelittle's house our present minester by a leaden pipe &amp; Coxke of Brase&#146;  (Hall, 37). Thomas and Mary Doolittle had at least six children, five of whose names are known&#151;a son Samuel, and four daughters, Mary Sheafe, Tabitha Hearne, Martha Taylor, and Susannah Roades&#151;and a fifth daughter who married Anthony Dawson.<br>
<br>Doolittle had a pregnant wife and three small children when he decided against accepting the terms for conforming to the Church of England set by the Restoration parliament and was ejected from his living as rector of St Alfege on 24 August 1662. He moved to nearby Moorfields, where he opened a boarding-school in his house. To accommodate a growing number of students he secured a larger house in Bunhill Fields and took on Thomas Vincent, the ejected minister of St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, as his assistant. In the summer of 1665, at the outbreak of the plague in London, he moved his family and school to Woodford Bridge, Essex, while Vincent stayed behind to minister to plague victims. After the plague abated Doolittle, however, was presented before Romford (Essex) sessions court on 26 April 1666 as one who had lately come from St Giles Cripplegate, with the intention of settling in Essex with his wife and six children; apparently fearing that the family would become dependent upon parish charity, the court ordered them to leave.<br>
<br>In the chaotic aftermath of the London fire in September 1666 Doolittle and his family moved back to Bunhill Fields where in defiance of the law he opened a meeting-house and continued in public the preaching ministry he had previously undertaken privately. This site quickly proved too small and to accommodate his growing congregation he had a new meeting-house built in Monkwell Street near Cripplegate. Having thus come to the attention of the authorities he was summoned privately by the lord mayor who attempted to persuade him to desist from preaching. Doolittle refused, and the following Saturday night soldiers were sent to his home to arrest him. Doolittle escaped as they were breaking down the door. The authorities subsequently harassed the congregation and confiscated the meeting-house for use as a chapel for the lord mayor. Later, Doolittle quietly returned to his home and school, and by 1669 was reported to be preaching again at his house in Monkwell Street.<br>
<br>Upon Charles II's declaration of indulgence in March 1672 Doolittle received a licence (dated 2 April 1672) to hold presbyterian services in &#145;a room adjoining his dwelling&#146; in Monkwell Street  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 167), and at this time he also set up an academy at a house in Islington, Middlesex. When the king's indulgence was revoked on 3 March 1673 he was forced to move to Wimbledon, Surrey. Several of his students went as well, taking lodging in neighbours' houses and going to Doolittle's home for studies. Doolittle was able to return to Islington before 1680 but on 16 November 1682 he was convicted for having preached at Monkwell Street the previous 15 September and was fined &pound;40. In April 1683, he was convicted of having repeated the same offence three times and fined &pound;100, but by this time he had moved again, to Battersea, Surrey. The authorities in Battersea, however, seized and sold his possessions. Doolittle was thereby forced &#145;to disperse his pupils into private Families at Clapham&#146;  (Tong, 29). In 1687 Doolittle was compelled to move yet again, to St John's Court, Clerkenwell, Middlesex.<br>
<br>After the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> of 1689 Doolittle returned to Monkwell Street and re-established both his ministry and his academy. Despite frequent disruptions his academy was reputedly the &#145;leading Presbyterian academy in London&#146;, accommodating as many as twenty-eight students  (McLachlan, 10). Among those who received instruction under Doolittle were the later nonconformist leaders Edmund Calamy and Matthew Henry, the Unitarian Thomas Emlyn, and nonconformist tutors John Ker and Thomas Rowe.<br>
<br>Doolittle's wife, Mary, died on 16 December 1692. Afterwards he seems to have stopped taking students, but within a few years he married a woman, also named Mary, who assisted him in his ministry. The second Mary Doolittle, &#145;my dear and loveing wife&#146;, survived her husband by only five months, dying in November 1707 (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/495, sig. 138; PROB 6/83, sig. 180<i>v</i>/213<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>As a pastor, Doolittle preached twice each Sunday, lectured on the Westminster assembly catechism on Wednesdays, and pursued a vigorous catechetical ministry. Already a popular author (his <span class="italic">A Treatise Concerning the Lord's Supper</span>, 1667, reached twenty-seven English editions, twenty-two Scottish editions, and twenty-six New England editions, as well as translations into Welsh and German), he was eventually the author of twenty-three treatises, tracts, and sermons, although he was valued most by his peers for his five works on catechizing.<br>
<br>Doolittle's surviving correspondence with Baxter demonstrates that he followed closely the theological debates between Anglicans and nonconformists and among nonconformists themselves. In most of his own published writings, however, he consistently chose to address pastoral and evangelistic concerns. His later reputation as one &#145;not eminent for compass of knowledge or depth of thought&#146; is undeserved, as it is based on condescending comments by his student Thomas Emlyn, whose rejection of &#145;the narrow schemes of systematical divinity&#146; and later drift into unitarianism did not predispose him to think favourably of his erstwhile tutor  (<span class="italic">Works of Thomas Emlyn</span>, vi&#150;vii). Though Doolittle suffered chronically from stone and other ailments, his final illness was brief. The Sunday before his death &#145;he preach'd, and Catechized with great vigour&#146;  (Williams, 32). Late the following week he became ill. He signed his will on Friday, and died the following day, Saturday 24 May 1707, in Monkwell Street, London, the last surviving London clergyman who had been ejected for nonconformity in 1662. He was buried in Bunhill Fields cemetery on 1 June.<br>
