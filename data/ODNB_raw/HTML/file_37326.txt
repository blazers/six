<span class="headword">Crosse, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1547&#150;1611), <span class="occ">naval commander</span>, was born at Charlinch, near Bridgwater, Somerset, the second of seven sons of William Crosse, gentleman, and Elizabeth, his wife, who also bore five surviving daughters. His earliest known employment was as a soldier with the regency army during the siege of Edinburgh Castle in 1573; he was wounded, &#145;and shall carry the mark to my dying day&#146; as he claimed much later (<span class="italic">Naval Tracts of Sir William Monson</span>, 1.213; <span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 18.297). His first recorded command at sea was of the bark <i>Bond</i> in Sir Francis Drake's West Indies raid of 1585. In the fleet list he was identified as Sir Christopher Hatton's man: one &#145;who long sense hathe medled at Sea but not of late, very lyke to do well&#146;  (Keeler, 49). On 2 October Crosse volunteered as a hostage during negotiations with the governor of Bayona to allow the English fleet to revictual there; and on 10 February 1586, at Cartagena on the Spanish main, he commanded part of a force, led by the expedition's vice-admiral Martin Frobisher, in a diversionary assault upon a harbour chain, while English troops took the city from the landward side.<br>
<br>In 1587 Crosse sailed in Drake's Cadiz expedition as a land captain. On 27 April he was sent back to England with dispatches announcing the success of the assault, and subsequently gave testimony during the investigation of William Borough's &#145;mutiny&#146; against Drake. In a list dated 22 December 1587 Crosse was one of fourteen men appointed to have charge of the queen's ships. He commanded the ship <i>Hope</i> as rear-admiral of Drake's squadron during the Armada campaign, and was mentioned in the unofficial &#145;Relation of proceedings&#146; as having done good service in the fight off Gravelines. During the early part of the campaign the <i>Hope</i> and Thomas Fenner's <span class="italic">Nonpareil</span> patrolled the coast of northern France, seeking intelligence of the approaching Armada. In May 1589 Crosse was appointed admiral of a fleet of seventeen sail to resupply the expedition of Drake and Sir John Norris off the coast of Spain. Separated from the expedition by storms he took several of his ships to the island of Porto Santo, which he captured, sacked, and ransomed back to its governor before returning directly to England.<br>
<br>In 1591 Crosse commanded the <i>Elizabeth Bonaventure</i> in Lord Thomas Howard's Azores squadron, a voyage notable only for the last fight of the <i>Revenge</i> and death of Richard Grenville. In the following year, now enjoying the patronage of Sir Walter Ralegh, he commanded the queen's ship <i>Foresight</i> in the memorable capture of the carrack <i>Madre de Dios</i>. The <i>Foresight</i> played a leading role in the fight, lashing herself to the Portuguese vessel's bow to prevent her crew from grounding her, until the remainder of the English squadron could come up to assist. Following the carrack's capture Crosse and his crew joined, or led, a general plundering of her cargoes, though his subsequent report of the episode to Lord Burghley  (BL, Lansdowne MS 70, fol. 86) tactfully omitted this detail. Several days later he met with the ship of his admiral, Sir Martin Frobisher, who accused him of having boasted of taking some &pound;10,000 worth of plunder (of which Crosse later admitted to only &pound;2000). Departing the fleet against orders Crosse returned to England to dispose of his booty. At Dartmouth, the Isle of Wight, and Gosport he sold some of his spoils (scenes during the latter occasion were compared to those at Bartholomew fair), but much was subsequently confiscated at Chatham by customs officials. In some grief Crosse wrote to his brother John a few days later: &#145;All my things are stayed and seized, and so tell Sir Walter Raleigh if he be not good to me, I shall be the worse by this voyage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 4.226). However, he appears to have retained sufficient prize-money to have acquired a ship, the <i>Exchange</i> of Southampton, later that year. She was outfitted as a privateer under the command of John Crosse, whose subsequent seizure of a Bayonne ship was deemed unlawful in the admiralty court.<br>
<br>In 1595 Crosse commanded the ship <i>Swiftsure</i>, which was sent with the <i>Crane</i> to rendezvous with Drake and Hawkins off the Portuguese coast&#151;again, with the intention of intercepting a plate fleet. However, the main English fleet had already moved out into the Atlantic before Crosse arrived in October, and he returned to England soon after without significant prizes. In a long letter to &#145;my master&#146;, Robert Cecil (the first reference to his new patron), he begged not to be judged by his ill success. In the following year, in the <i>Swiftsure</i> once more, Crosse served in the Cadiz expedition of Essex and Howard, and, with most of his fellow officers, was knighted by the lord admiral following the town's capture. In 1597 he was patrolling the narrow seas in the <i>Vanguard</i>, gathering intelligences from Dieppe and elsewhere and acting as courier for letters between Essex and Cecil. From January to March 1598 Crosse served as admiral of a channel squadron of sixteen ships without notable incident. As captain of the <i>Nonpareil</i> he was in 1599 part of the fleet under the lord admiral that was hurriedly assembled at the rumour of an impending Spanish invasion attempt.<br>
<br>Crosse appears to have retired from the sea soon afterwards on the grounds of ill health. In 1600 he was awarded some &pound;2700 from exchequer forfeits in recognition of his services, but this was largely consumed by his purchase of property at Marten Abbey in Wiltshire. He spent much time at court thereafter, particularly outside Cecil's chambers, attempting to obtain preferment. In 1601, following the arrest of the earl of Essex, a Captain Lee attempted to involve Crosse in a plot to imprison the queen in her privy chamber until she agreed to release her former favourite from the Tower. Crosse promptly betrayed the plot, and testified at Lee's trial. In July 1603 Sir Walter Ralegh asked Crosse to ride with him to Windsor to visit the new king, James I. This fateful occasion marked the start of Ralegh's long imprisonment; prudently, perhaps, Crosse confined himself to bed for a month thereafter with an unspecified illness.<br>
<br>In 1604 Crosse married Dorothy, the twice widowed daughter of Mitchell Green, a yeoman of the stirrup. By his own admission, he took this drastic step solely to &#145;have meat to eat the remainder of my years&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 19.45&#150;6); however, on 11 February 1606 he was petitioning Salisbury to halt the confiscation of Dorothy's estate by reason of her recusancy. His subsequent attempts to turn her from her fiscally irresponsible convictions by filling his house with protestant divines was wholly unsuccessful, as he admitted. It is not known how Crosse's petition was answered, but his later years appear to have been relatively penurious, despite further pleas to Salisbury to obtain for him a safe parliamentary seat. Crosse's last known entreaty to his old mentor, in 1610, was for the arrest of a man said to have owed him &pound;335 for more than five years. The plea was probably unanswered; in July of that year he petitioned the king, somewhat disingenuously, to allow him relief from his debts or otherwise to permit him to live abroad to avoid the shame of his poverty.<br>
<br>Crosse died on 18 October 1611 at Moulsham, Essex, where he was also buried, without known heirs. His wife probably predeceased him, as the sole benefactor named in his will was Gregory Fenner, of the Sussex seafaring family with whom he appears to have had long-standing associations. Crosse's career exemplified the vacillating fortunes that Elizabethan and Jacobean patronage conferred. Physically courageous and a talented sea commander, but indifferently honest and morbidly fearful of poverty, he appears to have been regarded as good company, both personable and likeable&#151;qualities that kept him at the door of powerful men when less endearing supplicants would have been dismissed as nuisances.<br>
