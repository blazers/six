<span class="headword">Somerset, Lord  Granville Charles Henry</span>  (1792&#150;1848), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 27 December 1792, the second of ten children of Henry Charles Somerset, sixth duke of Beaufort (1766&#150;1835), and his wife, Charlotte Sophia (1771&#150;1854), daughter of Granville Leveson-Gower, first marquess of Stafford (1721&#150;1803), and his third wife, Susannah. His mother was an evangelical Methodist known for her piety. The estates and influence of the dukes of Beaufort, whose seat was at Badminton, ranged from the counties and boroughs of Brecon and Glamorgan to Monmouth, Gloucester, Wiltshire, and Oxfordshire. Assured of a parliamentary seat, Somerset was encouraged to become his father's man of business and to pursue a political career. Disfigurement by a riding accident early in life did not impair his prowess as a sportsman and rider after hounds, but to save him embarrassment he was not sent away to school with his elder brother, <a href="#cosubject_26011">Henry, marquess of Worcester [<i>see below</i>]</a>. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 19 January 1811, and graduated BA on 4 November 1813 with the second prize in classics, MA on 29 March 1817, and DCL on 10 June 1834. Nothing is known of Somerset's attachments prior to his marriage on 27 July 1822 to Emily Smith (<i>d</i>. 1869), the youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25892/', "Robert Smith, first Baron Carrington (1752&#150;1838)")</script>, of the Smith family of bankers; &pound;30,000 was settled on her to accompany Somerset's portion of &pound;10,000.<br>
<br>On 20 May 1816 Somerset succeeded his uncle Lord Arthur Somerset (1780&#150;1816) as MP for Monmouthshire, and he retained the seat for life. A committed tory and opposed to parliamentary reform, he was appointed a junior Treasury lord by Lord Liverpool in March 1819; he resigned when the pro-Catholic Canning became prime minister in April 1827. He dated his lifelong commitment to the cause of the insane, whom he served from August 1828 as a metropolitan lunacy commissioner, to his service on the select committee of 1827 on pauper lunatics. He returned to the Treasury under the duke of Wellington in January 1828, declared with him for Roman Catholic emancipation in January 1829, and chaired Peel's London committee at the ensuing Oxford University by-election. Ousted with Wellington in November 1830, he proposed Peel as their party leader in the House of Commons.<br>
<br>From 1830 to 1834 Somerset played a leading part in organizing parliamentary and constituency opposition to Lord Grey's reform administration, being involved from the outset in establishing and managing the Charles Street committee and the Carlton Club. His own unopposed election in 1831, after voting against parliamentary reform on 22 March and 19 April, was attributed to his popularity as a hardworking MP attentive to his constituents' interests. He failed on 7 September 1831 to extend Monmouthshire's borough representation under the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span>, and was incensed at the forfeiture of the county's intended third seat to provide separate representation for Merthyr Tudful from 1832. However, he secured boundary changes favourable to the Beaufort interest in East and West Gloucestershire and Stroud. Perceiving voter registration, active local committees, and suitable, well-funded candidates as the keys to electoral success, from June 1831 onwards he oversaw the establishment and maintenance of networks of agents, attorneys, barristers, and Conservative landowners in constituencies influenced by his aristocratic relations. Undeterred by defeats in Gloucestershire and in the Monmouth district of Boroughs in 1832, he persevered and gained a reputation as an outstanding party manager at the general elections of 1835, 1837, and 1841, when his system was adopted throughout England and Wales.<br>
<br>From December 1834 to April 1835 Somerset was commissioner of woods and forests in Peel's ministry, with a seat on the privy council. As one of Peel's inner circle he gave advice on election matters, acted with Thomas Francis Fremantle, afterwards Baron Cottesloe (1798&#150;1890), Charles Ross (1800&#150;1860), and Francis Robert Bonham (1785&#150;1863) as a semi-official party whip, and was instrumental in ensuring that the tory veteran William Holmes (1779&#150;1851) resumed that role in 1838. From September 1841 to July 1846 he was chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster in Peel's administration&#151;passed over for the Irish secretaryship he coveted and for the governor-generalship of India lest caricaturists capitalize on his deformity and burlesque manner. On his appointment to the cabinet on 16 May 1844 Gladstone commended him as an excellent administrator, good tempered and good humoured but scarcely a statesman. Loyalty to Peel over corn-law reform in December 1845 cost Somerset the electoral support of his brother Henry, who spent &pound;20,000 promoting the candidature of their protectionist cousin Captain Arthur Somerset against him at the general election of 1847. Winning by 2235 to 2188 votes, Somerset was none the less broken by the ordeal, and died on 23 February 1848 at his home in Clarges Street, London, attended by his brother. He was buried a few days later at Kensal Green cemetery. His will, which provided for his widow and five children, was proved under &pound;2000 on 26 May 1848 and was executed by his widow and by Lord Sandon.<br>
<br>Somerset's brother <a name="cosubject_26011"></a><span class="headword">Henry Somerset</span>, seventh duke of Beaufort  (1792&#150;1853), <span class="occ">sportsman and courtier</span>, was born on 5 February 1792. He was tutored by the Revd Walter Fletcher of Dalston, Cumberland, and Edward Vernon, archbishop of York, entered Westminster School in 1805, and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 21 October 1809. Styled marquess of Worcester (1803&#150;35), he was renowned for his amorous escapades and as the founder in 1819 of the &#145;four-in-hand club&#146; and leader of the Badminton and Windsor hunts. He joined the 10th hussars in 1810 and almost immediately began an affair with the courtesan Harriette Wilson, which, as his parents intended and her <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> (published in 1825) confirm, languished while he was aide-de-camp to the duke of Wellington in the Iberian peninsula from 1812 to 1814. On 25 July 1814 he married Wellington's niece Georgiana Frederica Fitzroy (1792&#150;1821) at the house of her stepfather, Charles Culling Smith (1775&#150;1853). He was devastated by her death on 11 May 1821 from an inflammation of the lungs, but was soon portrayed in caricature as suitor to the widow of the wealthy banker Thomas Coutts, to the pregnant Miss Calcraft, and to Lady Jane Paget, daughter of the marquess of Anglesey, to whom he was briefly engaged. On 29 June 1822 he married his late wife's half-sister Emily Frances (1800&#150;1889), daughter of Anne and Charles Culling Smith, and went to France. The marriage, although not illegal, was voidable under the consanguinity laws, placing the legitimacy of any issue at risk. Attempts to have their union validated under the act of 1823 failed, and a second ceremony at Constance on 21 October 1823 was not recognized as a foreign marriage because it was conducted under Lutheran rites. In 1825 the couple, on whom over &pound;50,000 had been settled, returned to England with Somerset's two daughters and their only son, Henry Charles Fitzroy Somerset (1824&#150;1899), for whom the sixth duke of Beaufort was godfather. Six daughters were subsequently born to the marriage, which was safeguarded retrospectively under the act of 1835.<br>
<br>Excluding a three-month period, April to July 1831, Worcester was tory MP for Monmouth Boroughs from December 1813 until his defeat by Benjamin Hall, afterwards Baron Llanover (1802&#150;1867), in December 1832. He sat for Gloucestershire West from January to 23 November 1835, when he succeeded his father as seventh duke. Undistinguished as an Admiralty lord from May 1815 to March 1819, his main political contribution, for which on Peel's recommendation he was made KG on 11 April 1842, lay in his sponsorship of his brother's electioneering activities. He died of gout on 17 November 1853 at Badminton and was buried in the chapel there on 24 November.<br>
