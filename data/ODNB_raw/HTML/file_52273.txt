<span class="headword">Darwin, Sir  Francis</span>  (1848&#150;1925), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born on 16 August 1848 at Downe, Kent, the seventh of the ten children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7176/', "Charles Robert Darwin (1809&#150;1882)")</script>, the naturalist, and his wife, Emma (1808&#150;1896), daughter of Josiah Wedgwood (1769&#150;1843) and granddaughter of Josiah Wedgwood (1730&#150;1795). He was educated at home and then at Clapham grammar school, where Charles Pritchard, who later became Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford, was headmaster. In 1866 he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with first-class honours in the natural sciences tripos in 1870. He then studied medicine at St George's Hospital, London, with the intention of becoming a physician. In 1875 he obtained the MB degree in Cambridge. However, he never practised medicine, turning instead to botany; he was elected to the Linnean Society later in 1875. From 1874, except for brief periods of research, he spent the next eight years working as secretary and assistant to his father; in 1876 he went to the University of W&uuml;rzburg for some months to learn laboratory methods from Julius Sachs, and in 1881 he spent a short time working with Heinrich Anton de Bary at the University of Strasbourg. In 1874 he had married Amy Ruck, who died in 1876 giving birth to their son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32715/', "Bernard Richard Meirion Darwin")</script>. After the death of his wife he lived at Downe with his parents and child.<br>
<br>Darwin's first major contributions to botany were inspired by the collaboration with his father. The results of their observations and experiments were published in 1880 in <span class="italic">The Power of Movement in Plants</span>, whose title page reads &#145;By Charles Darwin assisted by Francis Darwin&#146;. The book was an extension of Charles Darwin's work on climbing plants and it showed that the same mechanisms can be observed in plants in general. By extending the idea of irregular circumnutation the Darwins analysed the growth movement of plants in response to factors of the environment such as light, gravity, and wounds. In addition, they demonstrated that the mechanism of curvature in both roots and shoots was the result of differential growth rates. They could also confirm that the effect of the stimuli on the growth movement was indirect and that light and gravity act on some substance in the tip of the root and the shoot, which is transmitted to other parts of the plant. Francis Darwin later refined some of the experimental techniques and modified their theoretical conclusions. Between 1880 and 1908 Darwin published a dozen papers and some public lectures he had given on growth movements in plants.<br>
<br>After his father's death in 1882 Darwin moved to Cambridge. In 1883 he married Ellen Wordsworth Crofts [<a name="cosubject_52273"></a><span class="headword">Ellen Wordsworth Darwin</span>  (1856&#150;1903)], a <span class="occ">lecturer in English literature</span> at Newnham College (where she had been a student in 1874&#150;7), with whom he had a daughter, Frances, who became known as a poet under her married name of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32570/', "Frances Cornford")</script>. In 1884 he became university lecturer in botany in Cambridge, co-operating with S. H. Vines in teaching plant physiology. In 1886 he was elected to a fellowship at Christ's College. After the appointment of Vines to the chair of botany at Oxford, Darwin became reader in botany (1888), a position which he held until 1904. During these years Darwin's academic interests were the teaching of botany, the editing of his father's letters, and the study of the control of water loss by plants.<br>
<br>When Darwin began teaching in Cambridge, British botany moved away from the purely taxonomic tradition towards a more experimental and physiological approach. Darwin's experience in holding a practical class in this new subject for many years encouraged him to publish <span class="italic">Practical Physiology of Plants</span> (1894). Written together with E. H. Acton, it was the first book of its kind in the English language. One year later a more elementary botanical textbook, <span class="italic">The Elements of Botany</span>, followed, in which he presented the lectures he had given to medical students.<br>
<br>In his own original research Darwin began to focus on the distribution and function of stomata and on the transpiration of plants in general. To analyse the control of loss of water by plants he invented or developed a variety of special instruments. In 1897 he introduced the horn hygroscope for the study of stomatal function and in later years the porometer, in which air was drawn through a leaf and its velocity measured, and other apparatus.<br>
<br>An additional focus of Darwin's scientific work was his editions of the letters and manuscripts of his father. In 1887 he published the three-volume <span class="italic">Life and Letters of Charles Darwin</span>, which included an autobiographical chapter and many annotations, as well as a delicately observed chapter of family reminiscences. He further produced one-volume versions of these in subsequent years. In 1903 a sequel, <span class="italic">More Letters of Charles Darwin</span>, followed, which was edited jointly with A. C. Seward. As a last important contribution to Darwin studies the edition of the two earliest evolutionary essays written by Charles Darwin (1842 and 1844) has to be mentioned (<span class="italic">The Foundations of The Origin of Species</span>, 1909). These books have provided the basis for all subsequent scientific biographies and papers on Darwin, and only recently have new editions of manuscripts and letters started to supersede Francis Darwin's editions.<br>
<br>After the death of his second wife in 1903 Darwin resigned from the readership in botany and moved to London, but after only about a year returned to Cambridge and continued his botanical research. In 1913 he married Florence, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fisher (<i>d</i>. 1920), the widow of Professor F. W. Maitland. His later publications consisted mainly of collections of earlier essays and lectures on a variety of subjects, including musical instruments, which had been a lifelong interest. Darwin's publications, which are dated from 1872 to 1921, include, besides several scientific books, lectures, and addresses, some sixty papers.<br>
<br>For his contributions to science Darwin received many honours. He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1882, served on its council in 1894&#150;5 and 1902&#150;8, and as foreign secretary in 1903&#150;7. He was made an honorary ScD of Cambridge in 1909, at the time of the Darwin centenary, and, in 1912, received the Darwin medal of the Royal Society. He received honorary degrees from the universities of Dublin, Liverpool, Sheffield, St Andrews, Uppsala, Prague, and Brussels. He was knighted in 1913. He died at his home, 10 Madingley Road, Cambridge, on 19 September 1925.<br>
