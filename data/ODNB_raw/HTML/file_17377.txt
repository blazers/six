<span class="headword">MacCarthy,  Denis Florence</span>  (1817&#150;1882), <span class="occ">Young Irelander and poet</span>, was born at 24 Lower Sackville Street, Dublin, on 26 May 1817, the son of John (1786/7&#150;1857) and Sarah MacCarthy (1787/8&#150;1845). A strong Catholic, he wanted to become a priest and went to Maynooth, but after two years of study, he changed to law at Trinity College, Dublin; he was called to the bar in 1846. However, his main interest was literature, and he also developed a keen interest in foreign languages, especially Spanish. His first poem, &#145;My Wishes&#146;, was published in the <span class="italic">Dublin Satirist</span> on 12 April 1834, and for the next two years he contributed both prose and verse to this magazine.<br>
<br>MacCarthy supported Daniel O'Connell's Loyal National Repeal Association, but his political interests were always subordinate to his literary tastes. Nevertheless, he employed his literary talents to encourage a cultural revival in Ireland, believing that it would lead to a repeal of the Union between Great Britain and Ireland. On 14 October 1843 his first contribution appeared in <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, to which he afterwards regularly contributed political verse and poetry under the pseudonyms of Desmond, Vig, Trifolium, Antonio, and S.E.Y., or above his initials. Some of his poems were published in the new edition of <span class="italic">The Spirit of the Nation</span> (1844). In 1845 he was a founder member of the '82 Club, a half-military organization, formed by upper-class members of the Repeal Association and Young Ireland.<br>
<br>In 1846 he edited <span class="italic">The Poets and Dramatists of Ireland</span> and <span class="italic">The Book of Irish Ballads</span> for Young Ireland's <span class="roman">Library of Ireland</span>, with introductory essays on the history and religion of the Irish, and on ballad poetry. In 1847 he was a member of the original council of the Irish Confederation, but &#145;was seldom seen at a committee&#146;  (Duffy, <span class="italic">Four Years</span>, 441). The following year he ceased to be a member of the council. Duffy maintains that MacCarthy was part of the Young Ireland movement because of his close friendship with <span class="italic">The Nation</span> writers, rather than because of passionate political convictions. He describes him as having a good sense of humour, and being charming in society, but reluctant to make public speeches  (Duffy, <span class="italic">Young Ireland</span>, 133ff.). This reluctance to attract public attention might perhaps explain his absence in purely political activities, rather than being due to a lack of strong convictions. He certainly was no radical, and was not involved in the revolutionary activities of the Confederation in 1848. However, he resumed writing for the new <span class="italic">Nation</span> in 1849, albeit contributing to it less frequently than before.<br>
<br>During the time of his involvement in Young Ireland, he married Elizabeth Donnelly (1820/21&#150;1874). The couple had nine children, six of whom predeceased him. His eldest son, John, published a collection of his father's poems in 1882. His daughter, Sister Mary Stanislaus MacCarthy OSD, was also a poet, publishing predominantly religious poetry.<br>
<br>Most of MacCarthy's original work and his translations from Spanish, German, French, Italian, Greek, and Latin poetry were published in periodicals. In 1850 the first collection of his poetry, <span class="italic">Ballads, Poems, and Lyrics Original and Translated</span>, appeared. In 1853 MacCarthy published <span class="italic">Dramas of Calderon</span>, his first translations of the works of the Spanish dramatist Calderon. All in all, MacCarthy translated fifteen of Calderon's plays. On the other hand, some of MacCarthy's early poems were translated into French by Le Chevalier de Chatelain and published in 1863&#150;4.<br>
<br>In 1853&#150;4, MacCarthy was appointed to a professorship in English literature at the Catholic University, Dublin, but being of a restless nature, he resigned after a few months, because he did not like the sedentary nature of the post. In 1857 he published <span class="italic">&#145;The Bell-Founder&#146; and other Poems</span> and <span class="italic">&#145;Underglimpses&#146; and other Poems</span>. In 1864 the ill health of some members of his family forced MacCarthy to leave Ireland for long periods of time. He travelled extensively on the continent, before finally settling in London in 1871, where he was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;100 a year. In 1872 he published <span class="italic">Shelley's Early Life</span>, and from 1873 onwards he regularly wrote religious poetry and prose for the <span class="italic">Irish Monthly</span>. At the request of the committees in charge of the celebrations, MacCarthy wrote the centenary odes in honour of Daniel O'Connell (1875) and Thomas Moore (1879). He was also elected a member of the Real Academia of Spain. In 1881 it presented him with a commemorative medal of Calderon's bicentenary, in recognition of MacCarthy's work in Spanish literature. MacCarthy spent the last few months of his life in Ireland, and died at his home, 4 Herbert Terrace, Blackrock, co. Dublin, on 7 April 1882. He was buried on 11 April in the family vault in Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin. A committee was set up in Dublin to honour his memory.<br>
