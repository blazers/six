<span class="headword">Damet,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1542&#150;1618), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born in Great Yarmouth; his parents' names are unknown. He is recorded initially as a notary and scrivener, later as a merchant. In 1566&#150;7 he was fined for not being a free burgess, suggesting that he was now aged twenty-four. Town clerk of Yarmouth in 1568&#150;73, he soon became a leading and trusted burgess, being chosen as alderman in 1574, one of the two ruling bailiffs of the town in 1577, 1592, and 1602, JP from 1578 onwards, and MP in 1584, 1586, 1593, and 1604. Local patriotism and the search for precedents during the town's protracted suits with Lowestoft over control of the herring fishery and in connection with applications for government help towards costly harbour works inform his historical writing. This includes a manuscript history of Yarmouth harbour from 1549 to 1567, a transcript of the borough's charters dated 1580, and a brief Yarmouth chronicle. His main work is &#145;Greate Yermouthe: a booke of the foundacion and antiquitye of the saide towne&#146;, completed between 1594 and 1599 and previously attributed to Henry Manship senior (<i>d</i>. 1569). It was first published in 1847. There is no indication that Damet was aware of contemporary historians such as Camden but he draws heavily on the town's archives and projects his vision of the dramatic landscape changes that permitted its rapid post-conquest development on an offshore sandspit. His work was derided by the more sophisticated Henry Manship junior (<i>d</i>. 1625), whose own history of Great Yarmouth was completed in 1619, but was quarried by Thomas Nashe for his <span class="italic">Lenten Stuffe</span> of 1599. Two manuscript maps compiled under Damet's influence reconstruct the Yarmouth&#150;Norwich region as it was in the year <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1000.<br>
<br>Damet's three wives were: Anne Ellys of Hemsby, Norfolk (married 1565, <i>d</i>. 1590); Alice Bishop, widow, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ylberde, of Yarmouth (married 1590, <i>d</i>. 1601); and Grace Humfrey, widow, whom he married in 1602. He fell ill in 1610 and retired to Grace's house at Rishangles in Suffolk; he died in 1618 and was buried at Great Yarmouth on 18 March. By his will dated 4 April 1617 he left four almshouses for Yarmouth seamen's widows. His daughter Mary married Ralph Owner, town clerk of Yarmouth in 1609&#150;33, but his son Edward had disappeared and was believed dead in 1617. He subsequently reappeared to put in a claim as heir, but was in want in 1625 when the town granted him a small pension. He died in 1628.<br>
