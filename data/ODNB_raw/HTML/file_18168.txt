<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Marten <span class="st"> [Martin]</span>,  Henry <span class="st"> [Harry]</span></span>  (1601/2&#150;1680), <span class="occ">politician and regicide</span>, was the eldest son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18167/', "Sir Henry Marten (c.1561&#150;1641)")</script>, civil lawyer and judge, and his wife, Elizabeth (1573/4&#150;1618). He was born in his father's Oxford house opposite Merton College chapel and had a younger brother, George, and three sisters, Elizabeth, Jane, and Mary.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandcareerto1640"></a>Early life and career to 1640</h2>After attending school in Oxford, Henry (or Harry as he was known by friends) matriculated, aged fifteen, on 31 October 1617 as a gentleman commoner from University College, graduating BA in 1620. He may have been the Henry Marten admitted to Gray's Inn in August 1618 and was certainly admitted to the Inner Temple in November 1619. In the 1620s he toured Europe and enjoyed much high living accompanied by, among others, Mildmay Fane, later earl of Westmorland. During his time in France he was much impressed with the French stoical philosophers.<br>
<br>Many details of Marten's life, particularly during his early years, remain unclear. He probably married twice. On 25 September 1627 he married a woman named Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1612&#150;1634), with whom he appears to have had three children: Margaret (<i>bap</i>. 1629), Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1632), and Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1634). His wife died shortly after the birth of her third child and was buried on 28 April 1634 at Hurley in Berkshire. On 5 April 1635 Marten married Margaret Staunton (<i>d</i>. 1679), widow of William Staunton and daughter of the London silkman and grocer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73790/', "Francis West (fl. 1624&#150;1634)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29081/', "West, Francis (d. 1652)")</script>]. The union was the idea of his father and according to John Aubrey, Henry acceded &#145;something unwillingly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 193). The couple had three children, two daughters and a son, Henry (<i>bap</i>. 1639).<br>
<br>Marten earned a reputation for licentiousness as both a womanizer and a drunkard early in his career. Aubrey describes him as &#145;a great lover of pretty girles&#146; and he is said to have cost his father &pound;1000 a year for the upkeep of his wild lifestyle  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 193). Much of his own money was also rumoured to have been frittered away on women and wine. This reputation allegedly earned him the ire of Charles I. Upon seeing Marten at a race meeting in Hyde Park the king is said to have exclaimed<blockquote>Let that ugly Rascall be gonne out of the Parke, that whore-master, or els I will not see the sport. So Henry went away patiently, <i>sed manebat alta mente repostum</i> [but it lay stored up deep within his heart]. (ibid.)</blockquote>Marten's business affairs are obscure during this period. In the 1630s he was described as merely a &#145;farmer&#146; of Hinton Waldrist, Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). During the latter part of the decade he and his brother managed their father's considerable estate, which stretched along the south bank of the Thames and the River Cole and centred on the village of Shrivenham. The brothers had run up considerable debts by the outbreak of the civil wars.<h2>
<a name="Politicalandmilitarycareer16401646"></a>Political and military career, 1640&#150;1646</h2>In April 1640 Marten was returned to the Short Parliament as a member for Berkshire. The following November he was returned for the same seat to the Long Parliament. Prior to the civil wars he developed a reputation as an assiduous committee member. He was part of the group that drew up the protestation of May 1641 and regularly attended the important committee of safety created in July 1642. In that year he and his brother George used contacts to elicit information about the activities of the court. Marten was subsequently paid &pound;500 towards intelligences and later bequeathed &pound;2000 to the &#145;service of the Commonwealth&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 2, 1640&#150;42, 408). He offered his merchant vessel, <i>The Marten</i>, as part of the naval summer watch and, commanded by George, it was part of the parliamentary fleet whose mutiny secured the appointment of the earl of Warwick as lord admiral. It is reported that when the king issued a commission of array for Berkshire, Marten tore up the document in front of his tenants. On the outbreak of war in August 1642 he subscribed &pound;1200 to the parliamentary cause and was named governor of Reading, but abandoned his post when the royalists marched on Oxford. He then raised a regiment by commandeering horses. During summer 1643 he chaired the committee for the general rising in London and although a plan to raise the whole country was not implemented, it formed part of the pressure against the aristocratic leadership of the parliamentarian army. Throughout his parliamentary career Marten enjoyed good living, but seems to have had little stomach for alcohol and was soon drunk. Yet he was capable of using this reputation as a political tool, pretending to sleep in the Commons chamber until, seizing his opportunity to make a rapier intervention, he would leap up from his feigned slumbering.<br>
<br>As early as 1641 Marten confessed to his friend Sir Edward Hyde that he did not believe that one man was wise enough to rule a whole nation. By 1642 he was identified as a key figure among those Sir Simonds D'Ewes referred to as the &#145;fiery spirits&#146; who used language disparaging towards the royal dignity. Having proclaimed kingship to be forfeitable he was excluded from pardon for life or estate by Charles I in the same year. In support of the puritan divine John Saltmarsh, the author of a pamphlet proposing the deposition of the king, Marten stated in the Commons on 16 August 1643 that &#145;it were better one family be destroyed than many&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Aulicus</span>, 19 Aug 1643). On being challenged to reveal to whom he referred he added without hesitation that he meant the king and his family. He was immediately imprisoned in the Tower of London and barred from the Commons. His imprisonment was to last fourteen days but his parliamentary ban was to span almost three years. Despite his non-attendance in the house he claimed to have signed the solemn league and covenant, although in retrospect he admitted doing so on grounds of political expediency rather than conviction. He commanded a troop in the Berkshire-trained bands and was appointed governor of Aylesbury on 22 May 1644. During the winter of 1645&#150;6 he acted as commander-in-chief, under Colonel Dalbier, of the infantry at the siege of Donnington Castle.<h2>
<a name="Republicanandregicide16461649"></a>Republican and regicide, 1646&#150;1649</h2>The narrative of Marten's return to the Commons is unclear. On 6 July 1646 the house voted to erase from the <span class="italic">Journals</span> the sections referring to the Saltmarsh affair. The following business was the disablement for delinquency of the Abingdon MP, Marten's brother-in-law, Sir George Stonehouse. Marten may first have stood for Abingdon and then transferred to the county seat. His close political ally and friend, William Ball of Barking, was then elected as a recruiter MP for Abingdon. Ball wrote pamphlets in a similar vein to Marten, and, when Ball died in 1648, his writings continued to appear in the presses, possibly edited or reissued by Marten. Marten subsequently helped Henry Nevile to the Abingdon seat.<br>
<br>After his return to the Commons, Marten emerged as the chief political ally of Thomas Chaloner. Chaloner questioned the involvement of the Scottish commissioners in the peace negotiations with the king, which were taking place at Newcastle upon Tyne. In October 1646 he made a speech in the house, subsequently dubbed the &#145;Speech without Doors&#146;, which called for peace to be settled without reference to the Scots or their wishes. Marten wrote several pieces in support of Chaloner, some published and others that remained in manuscript. His published pieces were issued anonymously, as befitted their extreme statements of hostility towards Charles Stuart, the barely hidden imputation of which was that Charles should be executed for murder. The aim of these tracts was to reduce Charles Stuart to the status of an ordinary citizen, and thus make him as liable as any Englishman to the same punishment for any crime he committed. The main pieces to appear in the press were <span class="italic">A Corrector of the Answerer to the Speech out of Doores</span> (1646) and <span class="italic">An Unhappie Game at Scotch and English</span> (1646). Marten's hostility towards the Scots continued and in 1648 he published two pieces of invective against the Scottish commissioners, arguing that the peace of England ought to be settled without reference to either the Scots or the king. The first of these was <span class="italic">The Independency of England Endeavoured to be Maintained</span>. He was instrumental in pushing through a vote of no addresses on 3 January 1648, by which the parliament agreed to cease sending overtures for peace to Charles. He explained this move in <span class="italic">The Parliaments Proceedings Justified in Declining a Personall Treaty</span>.<br>
<br>Marten developed a close working relationship with the Leveller leaders during the late 1640s. He was closest to John Wildman, who was to marry Lucy Lovelace. Wildman was named with Marten in a cipher outlining sympathetic individuals and regiments, as well as identifying opponents, during the army agitation of summer 1647. Throughout their lives Marten and Wildman retained their cipher letters as pen-names for each other. John Lilburne also trusted and respected Marten. The latter chaired the committee charged with examining Lilburne's imprisonment, a committee that was unable to secure Lilburne's release, and in <span class="italic">Rash Oaths Unwarrantable</span> the Leveller published an invective against Marten. Marten was hurt by Lilburne's personal attack and drafted a reply, &#145;Rash censures uncharitable&#146;, but did not publish it. The two seem to have mended their relationship and developed a mutual respect. Marten also knew several minor Leveller figures. He took part in negotiations to draw up an <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>, and was praised by Lilburne as the only parliamentarian to actively do so in late 1648. Marten approved of the idea of a fundamental constitution and was later, with Edward Sexby, to assist the frondeurs in drawing up a similar agreement for the French rebels.<br>
<br>In December 1647 King Charles signed the engagement with the Scots and this was to lead eventually to a second outbreak of war. Marten returned to Berkshire, and interpreted the Commons order to defend the counties as an opportunity to raise another regiment. This one was entirely unauthorized and its recruitment and actions were opposed both by the army commanders and by the Commons. He refused to answer for his conduct and moved his regiment around the midlands. It was called a regiment of Levellers and a combination of radical political views and a reputation for womanizing made the slur useful in denigrating both Marten's public and his private life. An ejected minister, William Turvil, sent news to London that appeared in a newsletter, <span class="italic">Bloody Newes from the North</span>. This was a sensationalist but exaggerated account imagining the regiment's extreme actions in Leicestershire. The frontispiece depicted Marten and his soldiers committing atrocities, which helped to foster a reputation as a violent incendiary, but in reality the regiment passed peacefully through Market Harborough. It fought under the banner &#145;For the People's Freedom against all tyrants whatsoever&#146;, with soldiers drawn from Marten's tenants and those he could incite to desert other parliamentary forces. It was armed and provisioned by requisitioning the possessions of others. It was eventually recognized as part of the New Model, although it seems never to have fought as such. According to the Leveller Richard Overton the incorporation of the regiment was a means to neutralize Marten's political voice and bring the process of political reform to a halt.<br>
<br>After Pride's Purge on 6 December 1648 Marten and Cromwell entered the Commons together. Marten made a speech in commendation of the lieutenant-general. This was a rare piece of co-operation between the two. The Scots were convinced that he hated Cromwell even more than he hated them, so much so that he would offer his regiment to assist Charles and the Scots rather than see Cromwell rise to power. Although he later claimed the purge to be a harbinger of Cromwellian military tyranny, at the time he supported the coup. He was named a member of the high court of justice to try Charles Stuart, and despite other constitutional commitments and attendance at the discussions on the <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>, he nevertheless attended regularly if intermittently. He signed the death warrant of Charles I; during the signing he and Cromwell allegedly splashed each other's faces with ink.<h2>
<a name="Politicalandreligiousviews"></a>Political and religious views</h2>Marten's political views remained unshakeable throughout his lifetime. He was always committed to a republican polity and was infamous in the early 1640s as the only person prepared to admit to such a view. He was a somewhat feckless man, starting a number of pieces in which he was to outline his political views but rarely completing them or sending them to the press. Either he got bored with writing them or political activity got in the way. Nevertheless, we can piece together a political philosophy based on two principles. Firstly, he argued that for a polity to be stable it must be in balance. This did not imply the Polybian balance between the three elements of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, but rather a pair of balance scales, in which the representative must always be in direct balance with those it represented. This was an expression of popular sovereignty, in which he argued that even if the Commons failed to act in the interests, or according to the wishes, of the people, the people could choose to create a 1500-member parliament to supersede a 500-member one. Secondly, he had a philosophy of the circularity of power, in which every element of the constitution must be directly represented and directly accountable to every other. Any alien element must be rigidly excluded. In particular this meant the House of Lords and the kingship. This circularity of representation was often interpreted in a nationalistic way, to describe the concept of English liberties, and thus, in Marten's political career, it was often used to pour scorn on the representatives of the kingdom of Scotland, and their insistence that they be part of tripartite peace negotiations that included Scottish commissioners, English commissioners, and the crown.<br>
<br>Marten also had radical views about religion. He was accused of being an atheist, but he did make a statement which implied that he did not question whether God existed but that his viewpoint was of radical scepticism because mankind did not possess the faculties to know what or who God was. A third party called him a follower of the Stoic Epictetus. Marten's scepticism meant it was incumbent on mankind to allow total toleration of all religious viewpoints. People did not have the knowledge, or the authority that knowledge would have conveyed, to pronounce one opinion on religion more right than another. This was a viewpoint that Marten carried through his political career, arguing for liberty even for Catholics. One of the daughters from his second marriage, Mary, married the Catholic peer Thomas Parker, Lord Morley and Mounteagle. Marten also opposed the conquest of Ireland on grounds that the English could not seek religious freedom for themselves and then impose a religious settlement on others. He was constantly and vehemently hostile to the Presbyterian and Scottish covenanters' desire to impose a national church system. He supported the right of Huguenot worship in London. He also practised toleration on his own estates, being more concerned by whether the congregations accepted ministers, than by their religious views. Many radical groups, first the Levellers and later in the 1650s religious radicals such as the Quakers, met at the sign of the Mouth, in Aldersgate. He was probably present at the Levellers' meetings and, while denying being part of the Quakers' meetings there, defended their right to gather.<h2>
<a name="Commonwealthcareer16491654"></a>Commonwealth career, 1649&#150;1654</h2>For the first two years of the Commonwealth, Marten was at the centre of state affairs. He enjoyed life in the spotlight and in wealth and ease. During 1652 he bought Derby House, centre of the state committees, as his private London house. He received lands in recognition of his expenditure at the state's service. There was an award of &pound;1000 a year, made on 3 July 1649, as well as lands in Eynsham, near Oxford, but the major awards consisted of the estates of Leominster Foreign, Herefordshire&#151;a patchwork of holdings formerly part of the priory of Leominster&#151;and Hartington, Derbyshire. The latter was a huge estate, running from Buxton in the north to Ashbourne and the Cheshire and Staffordshire borders in the south. Both estates proved difficult to manage. They were already encumbered by debts of fee-farm rents, non-payment of rents to the lord, and disputed possession, for which Marten's personal reputation, the manner by which he came by the estates, and his frequent absenteeism made him vulnerable to local royalist opponents, the most active of whom was Sir James Croft in Herefordshire. He was eventually brought down financially by the requirement to make back-payments to the new fee-farm rent farmer, Arthur Samuel. Marten attempted to alienate these lands in the 1650s to protect them from proceedings for debt and to provide for his family, but he was generally unsuccessful. He was assisted in managing his estates by a number of former Levellers, in particular John Wildman, Maximilian Petty, and William Wetton.<br>
<br>Marten was the author of the key constitutional changes of state. On 4 January 1649 he issued the definitive statement of Commons sovereignty on behalf of the house. He designed the new great seal and sat on the committees to abolish kingship and the Lords and to declare England to be a commonwealth. He was named to the first council of state, and was one of those who attempted to have its oath, the engagement, tightened, to include approval of retrospective actions&#151;the regicide&#151;as well as future government&#151;the Commonwealth. He was a supporter of the government, pejoratively known as the Rump Parliament, which he later described as responsible for &#145;the best frame of lawes yett extant in the World&#146;  (University of Leeds, Marten Loder MS 93/40, fol. 4). At the time he drew on an arresting parallel to justify the perpetuation of the parliament: when Moses was found in the bulrushes, he argued, it was agreed that his own mother was the best person to care for him. Members of the Rump, the army council, and Cromwell did not agree with Marten, and fearing that the Rump designed to perpetuate its sitting, or to call fresh elections with minimal protection against the return of men committed to a monarchical restoration, Cromwell brought soldiers into the Commons chamber on 20 April 1653 and forcibly ejected the Rump. This was an action that would crystallize Marten's and Cromwell's contempt for each other. Cromwell accused Marten of drunkenness and whoredom in the speech with which he announced the dissolution of the parliament. In a series of unpublished pieces Marten railed against the ejection of the Rump, Cromwell's ambition, and the loss of republican government.<br>
<br>Despite Cromwell's accusation there is little evidence of Marten's womanizing. His papers contain one claim to paternity, made in 1651. His reputation for whoring seems to have been generated by the flagrant way in which he breached conventional mores by openly living with a common law wife, Mary Ward, whose brother, Job, was parliamentarian commander of the fort at Tilbury. There is evidence that they were a couple from as early as 1649, when they lavishly entertained visiting dignitaries and kept liveried servants together. They may well have been a couple from Marten's earliest time in London in 1640. If so, this was a relationship that remained constant for forty years. It was, however, adulterous, and Marten was quite open about it. Mary referred to herself, and was referred to by others, as Mary Marten. There were frequent plays on the word &#145;leveller&#146; to argue that Marten's radical political stance was in fact a synonym for the seduction of women, and satires on Mary to imply his possession of a &#145;creature&#146;, in the same way that his regiment and his political power were bought. The couple had three daughters: Peggy, Sarah, and Henrietta (Bacon-hog).<br>
<br>Marten's ability to act publicly against the Cromwellian protectorate was stifled by the proceedings for debt against him. A combination of lavishly supporting the radical war effort, high living, the cost of supporting his family, investing in his brother's ambitions to be a Caribbean planter, and having been awarded lands which proved both underproductive and heavily encumbered, meant that he had amassed debts totalling approximately &pound;35,000 by 1654. Now deprived of the legal protection of a parliamentary seat, he became prey to numerous creditors with long-standing grievances against him. His creditors sued him in the upper bench, Oliver St John issued a warrant for his arrest, and, when apprehended, he was first committed to the upper bench prison in Southwark, and then allowed to live in the area known as the Rules of Southwark, where prisoners could live on licence. There he resided with Mary Ward in the Southwark home of her sister Frances. His brother, meanwhile, continued to live on credit in Barbados, writing back to Henry expressing incredulity at his plight, and inviting Marten to join him in the Caribbean.<h2>
<a name="Trialimprisonmentanddeath"></a>Trial, imprisonment, and death</h2>It was from the Rules of Southwark that Marten was recalled in 1659 to rejoin the reconstituted Rump Parliament. He did not have the power that he had formerly commanded, but he managed to secure the appointment of Edmund Ludlow as commander of the army in Ireland, and the use of Somerset House as a chapel for French protestant immigrants. At the restoration of Charles II royalists were first convinced that Marten had fled to the continent. He did, in fact, submit himself, on 20 June 1660, according to royal order. He was imprisoned first in the Tower of London, where, with other regicides, he awaited the decisions of the royal court and the parliament on their fates. At his trial in October 1660 he argued that they had spelt his name wrongly&#151;Henry Martyn rather than Harry Marten&#151;on the indictment and that he could not therefore be the same person who signed Charles's death warrant. He was nevertheless found guilty but famously saved from execution. This may have been because influential royalists were reluctant to create a martyr from someone of his personal notoriety. It may also have been because he was active in arguing for the lives of royalists when supporters of the high court of justice of the Commonwealth wanted retribution for war crimes that extended beyond solely the figure of Charles Stuart.<br>
<br>Marten was sent into internal exile, the usual fate of those who had taken an active role in the Commonwealth but had been opponents of Cromwell. He was sent first to either Holy Island or Berwick Castle. In 1662 the letters that he had written to Mary from the Tower were seized and published as <span class="italic">Coll. Henry Marten's Familiar Letters to his Lady of Delight</span>. He was transferred to Windsor Castle in May 1665, but Charles II ordered him removed from such close proximity to himself. From Windsor he was moved in 1668 to Chepstow Castle, where he remained for twelve years, in a suite of rooms in Bigod's Tower (now Marten's Tower), with liberty, at least initially, to travel around outside the castle. Mary shared his imprisonment in Chepstow, while his wife remained in the family home, Longworth Lodge, Berkshire. Their daughter Anne, who remained unmarried, looked after her. Anne died in 1671 and Margaret died, intestate, in 1679. Marten died at Chepstow on 9 September 1680, having choked while eating his supper. He was buried there in the Anglican church.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Marten's reputation, both for licentiousness and for radical politics, lived on after his death. In 1682 a pamphlet lampooned his supposed lasciviousness and applied it to his political radicalism. A character called Harvey was &#145;not so much for levelling the Men, as <i>Martin</i> the Women&#146; and &#145;all the Women in the City are with Child by <i>Martin</i>, and so longed for Levellers&#146;  (Menippeus, <span class="italic">The Loyal Satirist, or, Hudibras in Prose</span>, 1682, 14, 18). Aphra Behn, who claimed to have met George Marten in Surinam, wrote a play called <span class="italic">The Younger Brother, or, The Amorous Jilt</span> about the patriarch Sir Henry Marten, and his two wayward sons. Her political jokes, however, placed in the mouth of the Henry Marten character, were written out, considered dated by the time the play was published in 1688. Eighteenth-century pieces about him tended to dwell on his personal life, whereas in the nineteenth-century, revivals of republican thinking dwelt on his imprisonment for his political views. A modern biographer characterizes him as a &#145;sceptic and a republican &hellip; a landed proprietor who took risks and was prosecuted for debt, an adulterer who practised charity, and an ideologue who preserved a sense of humour&#146;  (Barber, xi).<br>
