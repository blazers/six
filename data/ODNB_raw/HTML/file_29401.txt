</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilde,  Thomas</span>, first Baron Truro  (1782&#150;1855), <span class="occ">lord chancellor</span>, was born in Warwick Square, Newgate Street, London, on 7 July 1782, the second son of Thomas Wilde, attorney, of London and Saffron Walden, Essex, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Knight. He was uncle of Lord Penzance and younger brother of Sir John Wilde (<i>d</i>. 1859), chief justice from 1827 of the Cape of Good Hope.<br>
<br>Wilde was educated at St Paul's School in London from 1785 until 1796, when he left to be articled to his father. Although he once ran away to try his hand at commerce, he was admitted attorney in 1805, and for some years practised as such on his own account. In March 1811, however, he entered himself at the Inner Temple and was called to the bar on 7 February 1817. By then he had already practised as a certificated special pleader for two years, and on 18 April 1813 married Mary, daughter of William Wileman and widow of William Devaynes, a banker; they had a daughter and three sons, one of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>Wilde had none of the personal advantages which heighten the effect of oratory. He was small and thick-set with irregular features, his voice was unmusical and his delivery monotonous. He had a speech impediment, which he evaded rather than overcame by the use of synonyms, but his mastery of the technicalities of pleading, his connections, and experience, joined to great talent and industry, all assisted his success. Retained in 1820 for the defence of Queen Caroline during the progress through parliament of the bill of pains and penalties, he readily surmounted the prejudice with which he was at first received by Brougham and Denman, and distinguished himself in cross-examination. The celebrity thus early gained opened the way to an extensive common-law practice, and Queen Caroline expressed her gratitude by making him, with Stephen Lushington, one of her executors. Wilde was made serjeant-at-law (13 May 1824), and in Trinity term 1827 he was advanced to the rank of king's serjeant.<br>
<br>On 31 May 1831 Wilde was elected for Newark-on-Trent as a whig. He won the seat only at the fourth attempt, lost it at the general election of December 1832, but recovered it on 5 January 1835 and retained it until the dissolution of 23 June 1841. Having unsuccessfully sought a puisne judgeship on account of his poor health, from 1841 to 1846 he represented Worcester. Like most great lawyers, Wilde was unfitted to carry the House of Commons by storm, and at first he confined himself to the discussion of points of detail in the measures for the reform of the representative system and the law of bankruptcy. On 2 April 1835 he made a rambling speech displaying more rancour than vigour in support of Lord John Russell's motion for a committee on Irish church temporalities. On his party's return to power on 8 April he devoted himself at first chiefly to election petition business, and on 16 February 1836 was appointed to serve on the Carlow election petition committee as legal nominee to examine witnesses without power of voting. On the question of privilege (the reporting of debates in the Commons) raised by the great case of <i>Stockdale v. <span class="italic">Hansard</span></i>  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 38, 1837, 1299; 48, 1839, 356) he maintained from the first the highest possible view of the dignity and authority of the House of Commons. During this controversy he succeeded Sir Robert Monsey Rolfe (afterwards Baron Cranworth) as solicitor-general (2 December 1839), and was knighted (19 February 1840). The tension between the House of Commons and the court of queen's bench was then extreme. Wilde was prepared for the most violent measures, and, though his excessive zeal was curbed on the whole by the attorney-general, John (later Lord) Campbell, he nevertheless opposed the legislative settlement of the question on the ground that it involved a tacit waiver of the privilege that it affirmed. He was no less jealous of the privileges of the serjeants-at-law. He opposed, and succeeded in obstructing Brougham's attempt, by means of the prerogative, to admit queen's counsel to equal rights of audience with serjeants in the court of common pleas, but reverence for the past did not blind him to the demerits of Westminster Hall as a setting for the law courts, and it was under his auspices that the first steps were taken towards their relocation in the Strand  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 57, 1849, 1162). He succeeded Campbell as attorney-general on 3 July 1841, but went out of office on the fall of Lord Melbourne's administration in the following September.<br>
<br>Wilde was one of the earliest converts to Rowland Hill's scheme of postal reform, which he introduced to the House of Commons on 27 June 1843. He also supported the measure of the same year for the more effectual suppression of the slave trade. His professional knowledge and skill showed to advantage in the discussions which arose on the report from the committee on the forged exchequer bills (4 April 1842), the reversal of the judgment against O'Connell (5 September 1844), and the question of privilege raised by the case of <i>Howard v. Gossett</i> (30 May 1845; <span class="italic">Hansard 3</span> 61, 1842, 1222; 70, 1844, 399; 76, 1844, 2007; 80, 1845, 1099).<br>
<br>Wilde's first wife died on 13 June 1840, and on 13 August 1845 he married Augusta Emma D'Este (1801&#150;1866), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/900/', "Augustus Frederick, duke of Sussex")</script>, and his wife, Lady Augusta Murray, daughter of the fourth earl of Dunmore. Wilde met his second wife on the journey accompanying the coffin of Queen Caroline to Brunswick in August 1821, as documented in Augusta's journal (TNA: PRO, PRO 39/93/20). He later acted for her brother in litigation which sought to establish his legitimacy. It was a romantic match, and her royal connections supplied a useful cachet in his subsequent career. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>On the formation of Lord John Russell's administration in July 1846 Wilde was reappointed attorney-general, but, in consequence of the sudden death (6 July) of Sir Nicholas Conyngham Tindal, he was at once appointed chief-justice of the court of common pleas. On 30 October he was sworn of the privy council. As a judge, he displayed the same strengths as at the bar&#151;an amazing attention to detail and acuteness in applying the law&#151;but was prone to losing the important amid the unimportant in the detail at his disposal. The chief-justiceship, for which the experience of a lifetime had eminently fitted him, he held for little more than four years, being induced in 1850 to become lord chancellor. He was sworn in on 15 July, was created Baron Truro of Bowes, Middlesex, and took his seat in the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Notwithstanding his age and inexperience of equity business, Wilde proved a competent chancellor, mastering the rules of equity in the same manner as he had earlier those of the ecclesiastical courts. But his success was achieved at the cost of intense study&#151;his judgments were invariably written&#151;and his health suffered in consequence. His period as lord chancellor saw the creation of the lords justices of appeal in chancery, who could hear appeals from the master of the rolls or the vice-chancellors with or without the lord chancellor being present. Thus was achieved the dual triumph of freeing the chancellor for the legislative business of the House of Lords and his duties as a minister, without severing his link with the actual administration of justice. Wilde also supported the <span class="roman">Common Law Procedure Act</span>, 1852, which ended the need to cite a specific cause of action in the writ which commenced proceedings at common law. For the future, the cause would appear in the pleadings, which unlike the writ could be amended. Effectively, therefore, the old forms of action were abolished.<br>
<br>Wilde was relieved of the burdens of office by the fall of the government in February 1852, and in 1853 ceased to attend the House of Lords. After two years of suffering he died at his residence, 13 Eaton Square, London, on 11 November 1855. His remains were interred on 17 November in the Dunmore vault in the churchyard of St Lawrence, near Ramsgate. His widow presented his law library to the House of Lords and his portrait to St Paul's School.<br>
