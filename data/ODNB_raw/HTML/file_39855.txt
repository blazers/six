<span class="headword">Peart,  (Thomas) Frederick</span>, Baron Peart  (1914&#150;1988), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Durham on 30 April 1914, the elder son (there were no daughters) of Emerson Featherstone Peart, a Weardale schoolmaster, and his wife, Florence Maud Hopper. The harsh realities of life for the families whose children his father taught gave Peart a lifelong commitment to the labour movement. Starting his education at Crook council school, he went on to Wolsingham grammar school and Henry Smith's school in Hartlepool. He read science at the College of the Venerable Bede (Durham University), becoming president of the Labour Club and of the university union. Excelling at boxing, he also represented his university at rugby and football.<br>
<br>Unusually for a science graduate Peart began studying at the Inner Temple. He was not called to the bar, opting instead to return to his roots in Durham as a schoolteacher and a lecturer in economics, campaigning with characteristic vigour to improve educational opportunities in its mining communities. After serving from 1937 for three years on Easington rural district council he enlisted in the Royal Artillery as a gunner in 1940. After distinguished war service in north Africa and Italy he returned home as a captain in 1945 and was elected Labour MP for Workington, which he served for thirty-one years. In that year he married Sarah Elizabeth (Bette), daughter of Thomas Lewis, mining engineer in South America. They had one son. Welsh, articulate, highly principled, a history graduate and teacher, Bette shared her husband's passion for equality of educational opportunity. From 1945 to 1951 Peart was parliamentary private secretary to Thomas Williams, minister of agriculture in the newly elected Labour government. They worked in total harmony; indeed, so identified was he with Tom Williams that he was the natural choice for the Ministry of Agriculture after Labour's return to office in 1964 under the leadership of Harold Wilson. At the same time he was sworn of the privy council.<br>
<br>Cabinet pressure led Peart to reduce farm subsidies in his first (1965) farm price review, which provoked farmers to civil disobedience, but he emerged from this baptism of fire a widely respected minister. His reputation was further enhanced by courageous and decisive handling of Britain's worst ever epidemic of foot and mouth disease. In the countryside he was ever more warmly received by farmers and farmworkers alike.<br>
<br>Peart's reservations at that time about European Economic Community membership ran deep, echoing those in most farming communities. He opposed in cabinet the Labour government's 1967 application for EEC membership because he was convinced that the common agricultural policy would deprive British farmers of secure incomes and make consumers worse off by excluding cheap food imports from the traditional suppliers, and he was concerned also about harmful effects of the policy on the Commonwealth's poorer developing countries.<br>
<br>In 1968 he became leader of the Commons, first as lord privy seal (April&#150;October) and then lord president of the council. His courtesy, friendliness, generosity, and good humour made him as popular as leader of the house as he had been as minister of agriculture. With Labour's defeat in 1970, he became opposition spokesman on parliamentary affairs (1970&#150;71), agriculture (1971&#150;2), and defence (1972&#150;4). He also served as leader of Labour's delegation to the Council of Europe, of which he was vice-president in 1973&#150;4. In February 1974, with Labour back in office, he became minister of agriculture again. By then, exploitation by Commonwealth beef and sugar producers of rising world prices for their products led him reluctantly to come to terms with Britain's EEC membership, to which British farmers were now more favourably inclined.<br>
<br>In 1976, with James Callaghan as prime minister, Peart received a life barony and, as lord privy seal, became leader of the House of Lords. Following Labour's defeat in 1979 he led the opposition peers until 1982. He was also chairman of the Advisory Council for Applied Research and Development (1976&#150;80) and the Retail Consortium (1979&#150;81). He was an honorary DSc of Cranfield Institute of Technology (1977), honorary FRCVS (1969), and a freeman of the City of London (1968).<br>
<br>Peart was one of the best-liked parliamentarians of his generation. Tall, gentlemanly, with patrician good looks and a naturally straightforward manner, he was always enjoyable company. In 1984 he was savagely attacked by two armed robbers who had broken into his home. His health was shattered and he never fully recovered. He died on 26 August 1988 in hospital in Tooting, London. He was survived by his wife.<br>
