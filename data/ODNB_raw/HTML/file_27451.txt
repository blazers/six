<span class="headword">Tilney,  Edmund</span>  (1535/6&#150;1610), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born in 1535 or 1536 (in a chancery suit in 1599 he gave his age as sixty-three), the only son of Phillip Tilney (<i>d</i>. 1541), an usher of the privy chamber to Henry VIII, and his wife, Malyn Chambre, a chamberwoman to Queen Katherine Howard. His paternal grandfather, Sir Philip Tilney, was closely attached to Thomas Howard, second duke of Norfolk, who married first his cousin Elizabeth and later his sister Agnes. These marriages allied the Tilneys to virtually every important family in the country, including the royal family. Malyn Tilney, however, was implicated in the scandal of Katherine Howard's adultery. She was sentenced to life imprisonment and loss of goods in 1543, but was pardoned after the principals were executed. Phillip Tilney died in debt in 1541 and was buried in St Leonard's Church, Streatham.<br>
<br>Malyn and the young Edmund were perhaps taken into the household of Agnes Howard, the dowager duchess of Norfolk, since their Howard connections remained strong. There is no record of Tilney's having received formal education, but he was trained for a career at court. His later writing shows knowledge of Latin, Spanish, French, and Italian as well as history, topography, law, geography, genealogy, and government. No evidence survives of travel on the continent, but it is not unlikely. In 1568 Tilney published <span class="italic">A Brief and Pleasant Discourse on the Duties of Marriage, called the Flower of Friendshippe</span>, which he dedicated to his distant cousin the queen. An accomplished exercise in courtly taste and rhetorical skill, it adroitly advertised his suitability for employment, and went through at least five editions in his lifetime.<br>
<br>In April 1569 Tilney was chief mourner at the funeral of Edward, the third son of Lord William Howard, and in 1572 he joined his cousin Charles Howard (later lord admiral) in the House of Commons as burgess for Gatton in Surrey. It was Charles who secured Tilney the post of master of the revels, first under a yearly commission from February 1578, and formally under patent from 24 July 1579. The revels office arranged entertainment at court, and there had been dissatisfaction with its costs and poor service. A &#145;man of credit&#146; was sought to reform it, and Tilney was that man. His success owed much to greater reliance on professional actors, flourishing in London's new theatres. Their plays were cheaper to stage than the court's own masques and more polished than other entertainments. On 24 November 1581 Tilney received a special commission, giving him powers to impress workmen and materials at fair prices, to require actors to rehearse their plays before him (from 1586 to 1607 in his spacious quarters in St John's, Clerkenwell), and to revise them for court performance. Rivalry between nobles at court was another problem, as each wanted his own actors to perform. In 1583, and instructed by Sir Francis Walsingham, Tilney created the Queen's Men, an &eacute;lite company picked from the finest performers available, who then dominated court theatricals for several years.<br>
<br>On 4 May 1583 Tilney applied for a licence to marry Mary Bray (<i>d</i>. 1604), the daughter of Sir Thomas Cotton and the widow of Sir Edward Bray, whose lands in Surrey she inherited for the term of her life. Tilney had to go to law over these, as also over the will of John Digges, of which he was executor with his cousin Phillip. Digges was employed in the revels office from 1579 to his death in 1585 and was described by those opposing the Tilneys as a thief and shifter, &#145;named and reputed to be one Tyllney's bastard&#146; who died in &#145;Mr. Tyllney's house in St John's&#146;. Wrangling continued into the 1590s, but Tilney eventually acquired property in Middlesex under the will. Income from Mary's inheritance bought their principal property, the largest house in Leatherhead, Surrey, where the Tilneys entertained the queen on progress in August 1593. By 1594 Tilney was the greatest landholder of the parish and a county justice, and was thereafter much involved in local affairs.<br>
<br>From Tilney's arrangements with the actors at court there grew a general system of licensing plays, companies, and theatres in the London area, as reflected in Philip Henslowe's <span class="italic">Diary</span>. The relationship had a profound effect on the development of Elizabethan drama. Progressively fewer companies were allowed in the capital, but Tilney was their protector as much as their overseer. His licences protected them from civic officials and gave their plays a kind of performance copyright. In 1592 the lord mayor of London identified him as an obstacle to eradicating the actors from the city altogether. Tilney's censorship (evident in the extant manuscript of <span class="italic">Sir Thomas More</span>) ensured that plays would not offend important people or friendly foreign powers, and that they did not openly address matters of state or religious doctrine, but he left actors creative scope to be &#145;the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, <span class="smallcap">II</span>.ii). In 1598 the privy council expressly placed Tilney in control of the only companies then allowed to perform around London, the Chamberlain's Men and the Admiral's Men. In 1604 Queen Anne appointed Samuel Daniel licenser of the children of the queen's revels, but that arrangement did not last, and by his death Tilney securely controlled the London stage as well as licensing actors and other entertainers on tour in the provinces.<br>
<br>Tilney was never knighted but was entitled to be marshalled with bachelor knights. Between fees for attendance at court, his salary (&pound;100 in 1595), and his income from theatrical licensing (estimated at &pound;50 per annum), he perhaps earned &pound;200 per annum beside rents from his estates, making him a wealthy man. Even so, by 1601 he was in financial difficulty, and his cousin Thomas agreed to pay 50 marks per annum against the expectation of inheriting his property. Mary Tilney died childless on 20 February 1604, and her Surrey lands reverted to her first husband's grandson. In 1607 Tilney was sued by Elizabeth Cartwright, seller of the Leatherhead house, for the annuity which the deal included. Perhaps in response to financial difficulties, Tilney had for some years sought further advancement at court. In the late 1590s, to advertise his claims, he set about a confidential work of diplomatic intelligence, &#145;Topographical descriptions, regiments, and policies&#146; of the eight major countries of Europe; running to a quarter of a million words, it was meant to be an aid to foreign policy. He planned to present it to the queen in a scheme backed by Lord Admiral Howard, whereby Tilney would become master of ceremonies, while the revels would go to Sir George Buck or Buc. The queen died, but Tilney revised his &#145;Descriptions&#146; and added a dedication to James I. Sir Lewis Lewkenor, however, was made master of ceremonies in 1603. Tilney remained in post, and Buck received only the reversion to his office. Tilney abandoned his manuscript, which survives in two states (Folger Shakespeare Library, MS V.b. 182; University of Illinois Library MS, uncatalogued, <i>c</i>.1603).<br>
<br>Buck was a distant relative of Tilney, but there is no substance to suggestions that he was involved in the revels office before Tilney's death. Indeed there may have been tension between them: after Phillip Tilney died in 1602 the family lost land in Lincolnshire, when Buck sued as the nearest relative of Phillip's mother. From 1606 Buck began to license plays for the press, an authority not previously associated with the revels office. Tilney licensed for the press only Edward Sharpham's <span class="italic">Cupid's Whirligig</span> in June 1607. The accounts reveal his constant attendance at court throughout his final revels season of 1609&#150;10. On 1 July 1610 he made out his will in &#145;his own hand and form&#146; and with Christian piety, settling debts, making liberal provision for the poor and bequests to friends and relatives, and leaving the promised proceeds of his house to Thomas Tilney. He died on 20 August, and was buried on 6 October at St Leonard's Church, near his father's monument.<br>
<br>Edmund was related to Charles Tilney, one of the Babington conspirators, and the son of Edmund's cousin Phillip. Phillip and Edmund Tilney were bitter about the treatment Charles received; in a Star Chamber suit Rafe Bott testified that they &#145;thyrsted and longyd to be revengd on him&#146;, believing he had had custody of Charles in the Tower. A copy of <span class="italic">Locrine</span> (in the Bibliotheca Bodmeriana, Cologny-Gen&egrave;ve) contains a note by Sir George Buck, claiming the play was written by Charles Tilney under the title &#145;Elstrid&#146;, and that Buck himself had written dumb-shows for it. Tilney's grandmother Margaret was Buck's aunt, so the claim is plausible, though the play as printed was probably revised by a later hand.<br>
