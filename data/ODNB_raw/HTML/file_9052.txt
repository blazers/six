<span class="headword">Faber,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1660&#150;1721), <span class="occ">draughtsman and engraver</span>, was born about 1660 at The Hague. He lived in the Netherlands until at least 1696 and established a reputation in Amsterdam as a portrait miniaturist, working with pen and ink on vellum. He then moved to England and settled in London, where his earliest portrait, of Simon Episcopius, was dated 1698. Soon afterwards he started to work with black lead on vellum, in the manner of the celebrated English miniaturists David Loggan and Robert White, and began to experiment with mezzotint engraving. By 1707 he had established a printselling business at the Two Golden Balls, near the Savoy in the Strand, whence he moved about 1716 to the Golden Eagle by the Fountain tavern, near Essex Street. Developing his skill as a mezzotint engraver, Faber published a wide range of portraits between 1707 and 1719, some of them after his own drawings. Many of his subjects were clergy, among them high-churchmen such as Francis Atterbury, Henry Sacheverell, Henry Shute, Andrew Snape, and Philip Stubbs. He also engraved Jacobites, such as James Sheppard and the second duke of Ormond, and produced four portraits of Charles I, one version taken from Van Dyck and three others (1713) after Edward Bower's study made during the king's trial. However, Faber's output was not entirely partisan: he engraved portraits of Oliver Cromwell, George I, dissenting clergy such as Daniel Burgess and Samuel Rosewell, and various &#145;remarkable&#146; characters, noted for their great age or eccentricity. In addition he produced several sets of portraits: <span class="italic">Twelve Ancient Philosophers</span> (after Rubens), <span class="italic">Twelve Caesars</span>, <span class="italic">Twenty-One Reformers</span>, and <span class="italic">The Four Indian Kings</span> (1710). In 1711 and 1712 Faber was at Oxford, working with George Vertue to engrave portraits in the picture gallery of the Bodleian Library: these included mezzotints of Geoffrey Chaucer, John Hevelius, Ben Jonson, and Duns Scotus. Between 1712 and 1714 he engraved forty-five portraits of the founders of Oxford and Cambridge colleges, a project that Vertue regarded as his &#145;most considerable work&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.73). The plates for these were reworked and republished throughout the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Faber died at Bristol in May 1721, having for some years worked with his son and pupil <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9053/', "John Faber (c.1695&#150;1756)")</script>, whose prolific achievements eventually eclipsed those of his father.<br>
