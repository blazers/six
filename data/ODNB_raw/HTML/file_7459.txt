<span class="headword">Dell,  Henry</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1733), <span class="occ">bookseller and playwright</span>, was the son of Henry Dell, a tailor in St Peters Chalfont, Buckinghamshire. He was apprenticed to the London stationer James Penny on 6 March 1750 and was freed as a member of the Stationers' Company on 5 July 1757. As a bookseller, Dell first appears trading in Tower Street, London, possibly from the same premises as his former master; he served as master to Edward Barker between 6 December 1757 (when the apprentice was turned over to Dell from Kenrick Peck) and 12 June 1759 when Barker was freed. On 6 June 1758 Jonathan Turner Dell, probably Dell's brother, was also bound to Dell but he never seems to have completed his term. By 1765 Dell was trading as Dell &amp; Co. at the corner of Brooke Street and Holborn, London, and appears to have been mostly concerned with the peddling of secondhand books.<br>
<br>As a bookseller Dell forged a less than distinguished career, although he did continue to issue catalogues until 1793, but it was his association with the London stage which dominates his reputation. His acting career seems restricted to a curious attempt to perform the part of Mrs Termagant at Covent Garden Theatre in Thomas Shadwell's popular play <span class="italic">The Squire of Alsatia</span>. Dell appears to be the only man to take the role of Mrs Termagant during the eighty-year history of the play, and not surprisingly his performance was, by all accounts, without success. He was also the author or adapter of four plays, the first of which was <span class="italic">The Spouter, or, The Double Revenge</span>, an original comic farce produced in 1756. Although there is no record of performance, it seems that Dell's play was the inspiration for Arthur Murphy's <span class="italic">The Spouter, or, The Triple Revenge</span>, which was performed at Covent Garden Theatre on 26 April 1756. That same year Dell wrote a tragedy called <span class="italic">Minorca</span> which was &#145;printed just when the place from which it is named was taken. Nothing can be more contemptible than it is in every point of view&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Theatrical Dictionary</span>, 186). The untimely nature of the play prevented its performance; however, a second edition was printed in 1756 in which Dell responded to &#145;what obscure hackney writers have been pleased to say concerning a few mistakes&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Dell also adapted Cibber's <span class="italic">Comical Lovers</span> as a two-act comedy called <span class="italic">The Frenchified Lady Never in Paris</span>, which was first performed at Covent Garden Theatre on 23 March 1756 and regularly revived there and at Drury Lane Theatre until 1773. The following year another adaptation by Dell called <span class="italic">The Mirror</span>, from Thomas Randolph's <span class="italic">The Muses' Looking-Glass</span>, appeared but it was never acted.<br>
<br>Some years later Dell wrote and published <span class="italic">The Bookseller: a Poem</span> (1766), which one reviewer in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> described as &#145;mere prose in rhyme&#146; and which another critic denounced as &#145;a wretched, rhyming list of Booksellers in London and Westminster, with silly commendation of some, and stupid abuse of others&#146; (<span class="italic">GM</span>; Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 3.641). Nothing further is known about Dell's life or career and he reputedly died in poverty at his place in Holborn but no record of his death or estate can be found. He does not seem to have been the Henry Dell, bachelor, formerly of Kew, whose estate was administered on 11 March 1795.<br>
