<span class="headword">Waldron,  George</span>  (1689/90&#150;1726<span class="mult">x</span>31), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was the son of Francis Waldron of London who was descended from an ancient Essex family. He attended Felsted School and on 7 May 1706 he matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, when he was stated to be &#145;aged 16&#146;. On 28 November 1711, at St James's Church, Clerkenwell, he married Theodosia Clift (<i>d</i>. in or after 1731). Most of the information about his later life comes from snippets in his published works.<br>
<br>Waldron lived in adult life on the Isle of Man, where he acted as commissioner from the British government to watch and report on shipping in an attempt to stop Dutch, Irish, and East India vessels unloading their cargoes on Man, later to be smuggled into Britain, thus escaping British excise duties. In 1726 Waldron wrote and published his <span class="italic">Description of the Isle of Man</span>, which is of particular note for its retelling of the legends and folklore of the island. Waldron was the earliest author to record the traditional tales of the fishermen and country people of Man, though he rendered them in standard English without the characteristic expressions used by Manx people. He had lived on the island for nearly twenty years and evidently took pleasure in Manx culture, though he says little about the island's topography or geography. Waldron died in England in or before 1731, just after he had obtained a new deputation from the British government and just before his <span class="italic">Compleat Works in Verse and Prose</span> (1731) was printed for the &#145;widow and orphans&#146;. The dedication to William O'Brien, earl of Inchiquin, is signed by Theodosia Waldron. The first part contains &#145;Miscellany poems&#146; and the second consists of &#145;Tracts, political and historical&#146; and includes Waldron's main work, <span class="italic">A Description of the Isle of Man</span>, detailed above. His <span class="italic">Description</span> was reprinted in 1744, with a new edition in 1780, and in a scholarly edition with an introductory notice and notes by the Manx antiquary William Harrison (1802&#150;1884) for the publications of the Manx Society (vol. 11, 1865). Sir Walter Scott made extensive use of Waldron's <span class="italic">Description</span> while writing <span class="italic">Peveril of the Peak</span>, and transferred long extracts from it to his notes to that romance. He described Waldron's work as &#145;a huge mine, in which I have attempted to discover some specimens of spar, if I cannot find treasure&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Waldron also published various speeches and poems declaring his loyalty to the Hanoverian succession.<br>
