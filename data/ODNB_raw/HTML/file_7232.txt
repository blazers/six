<span class="headword">Davies,  Edward</span>  (1756&#150;1831), <span class="occ">antiquary and author</span>, was born on 7 June 1756 at a farm called Hendre-einon, in the parish of Llanfaredd, Radnorshire, the eldest son of Edward Davies and Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Owens. He came from farming stock; various members of his family owned ten farms in the neighbourhood. His sight was impaired when he met with an accident at the age of six, and this weakened him for the rest of his life and resulted in blindness in his old age. His knowledge of the Welsh language was probably more competent than some commentators have suggested (he wrote a hymn in Welsh, completed by August 1776). He spent only one year as a pupil at Christ College, Brecon, in 1774. Undeterred, he opened a school of his own in the Methodist meeting-house at Hay in 1775. In 1779 he was ordained deacon, and between 1779 and 1783 served as a curate in several parishes in Herefordshire. About this time he produced three five-act plays: two comedies, <span class="italic">The Gold Mine</span> and <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, and a tragedy, <span class="italic">Owen, or, The Fatal Clemency</span>.<br>
<br>From 1783 to 1799 Davies was a master at the endowed grammar school at Chipping Sodbury and was appointed to the curacy of the neighbouring parish of Badminton. In 1783 he married his first wife, Margaret Smith (<i>d</i>. 1814) of Whittington. During the last decade of the eighteenth century he devoted himself, in spite of failing health and anxiety neurosis, to a variety of interests connected with Celtic antiquity and with the transcription from manuscript sources of early and medieval Welsh poetry. He made the acquaintance of William Owen Pughe and Edward Williams (Iolo Morganwg). Many of his transcripts were published in <span class="italic">The Myvyrian Archaiology</span> (3 vols., 1801&#150;7), to the editors of which he had lent his huge collection.<br>
<br>Davies was a self-educated scholar and prolific author who was, by and large, poorly qualified, misguided, and uncritical, although at times he could show considerable care, sagacity, and a good instinct for new and valuable interpretation. His enthusiasm for writing appears to have been fired by a polemical spirit, in part reacting to jibes made by his Chipping Sodbury parishioners who ignorantly claimed that the Welsh language was a &#145;barren jargon&#146;.<br>
<br>Davies's earliest significant work was <span class="italic">Aphtharte, the Genius of Britain</span> (1784), a mannered and patriotic poem that reflected his conviction of a connection between Greek and Celtic mythology. <span class="italic">Vacunalia, Consisting of Essays in Verse</span>, which showed the influence of Virgil's <span class="italic">Bucolics</span> and a knowledge of Ossianic literature, appeared in 1788. He also wrote an early novel, now an extremely rare book, <span class="italic">Elisa Powell, or, Trials of Sensibility</span> (1795). An overambitious attempt at studying, <i>inter alia</i>, the origin of speech and the fundamental principles of language came to fruition in <span class="italic">Celtic Researches, on the Origin, Traditions and Language of the Ancient Britons</span> (1804). In 1809 he published <span class="italic">The Mythology and Rites of the British Druids</span> (1809), which ranged from a consideration of classical sources to false suppositions concerning cromlechs and Stonehenge and &#145;British&#146; superstition. Another work, <span class="italic">The Claims of Ossian Examined and Appreciated</span> (1825), was an attack on Macpherson, not least for disparaging the Welsh bards.<br>
<br>In 1799 Davies was appointed to the less demanding curacies of Elberton and Olveston in Gloucestershire, enabling him to combine more effectively his pastoral duties and his insatiable interest in early Celtic history. Theophilus Jones, the Brecon historian who had been his contemporary at school, supported him in his quest for preferment and for subscribers to his publications. In 1802 he secured the perpetual curacy of Llanbedr in Radnorshire and in 1805 became rector of Bishopston in Gower. He continued to live in Olveston until 1813, when he moved to Bishopston. From that year until his death he made his home at Bishopston. In 1816 he married his second wife, Susanna Jeffreys. He died on 7 January 1831 at Bishopston rectory and was buried in Bishopston cemetery.<br>
<br>Edward Davies is remembered today chiefly for his extensive works the <span class="italic">Celtic Researches</span> and the <span class="italic">British Druids</span>. Yet his ability to cope with a complex range of sources relating to ancient mythology, patriarchal religion, and linguistic variation was too limited for tackling the tasks on which he worked so assiduously. However, even though his knowledge was too inadequate for producing a reliable interpretation of early and medieval Welsh poetry, his enthusiastic activity was important for the transmission, publication, and study of much of this literature. It is to his credit that he was one of the first to query the authenticity of fallacious claims made by Iolo Morganwg with regard to the Gorsedd of Bards.<br>
