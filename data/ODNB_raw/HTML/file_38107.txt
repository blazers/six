<span class="headword">Warltire,  John</span>  (1725/6&#150;1810), <span class="occ">public lecturer</span>, was born in Switzerland of unknown parentage. Nothing is known of his early life, but he probably spent an extended period at Palmyra in Syria. Indeed, M. H. Miller later recorded that Palmyra was among Warltire's &#145;favourite subjects, [owing to his] having lived many years among the Arabs&#146;  (Miller, 217). Warltire arrived in England, possibly to escape religious persecution, in the 1750s. He began work as a valet at Ashover, Derbyshire, but at Michaelmas 1760 started teaching at Ashover Hill School at &pound;9 a year. He left in August 1762, having there &#145;improved himself in his studies&#146;  (White Watson). In November 1762 he married, at Wolverhampton, Mary Stringer (<i>c</i>.1743&#150;1790), apparently a housekeeper in the residence where he had been valet. His age was recorded as twenty-three, probably incorrectly.<br>
<br>Warltire started his new career as an itinerant science lecturer in 1763. Over eighty advertisements for his courses have been located throughout the English provinces, in an area bounded by Plymouth, Chester, Manchester, Leeds, and Norwich. His first lecture course was at Lutterworth, where his eldest son was born in October 1763. He then lectured in many towns in that area, already giving special courses for women, demonstrating with orrery, air-pump, and solar microscope. His first emphasis was astronomy and he issued a <span class="italic">Short Account of the Solar System</span> in 1764 (seven editions with changing titles and emphases to post-1769). He later issued many other equally ephemeral publications, chiefly to accompany his lectures. By 1766, when he gave a course of lectures at Salisbury, his teaching covered the whole range of experimental philosophy and included &#145;new experiments in electricity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury Journal</span>, 14 April 1766). In 1769 Warltire added a new course in chemistry, recording in his lecture notes that &#145;the Atmosphere is composed of two distinct Sorts of fluid Matter&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1771 Warltire was emphasizing the utility of his scientific lectures. In that year his course at Ashbourne was attended by Samuel Johnson (1709&#150;1784), who was much stimulated by its metallurgical and mineralogical content. At Shifnal in 1772 Warltire carried out experiments on air in the blood of a live sheep. These were soon followed by other frigorific experiments, involving a thermometer placed in an air-pump, all for Erasmus Darwin (1731&#150;1802). In 1773 Warltire gave lectures at Warrington and from 1774 assisted Joseph Priestley (1733&#150;1804) with experiments and chemicals at Calne on dephlogisticated air (oxygen). By 1775 his &#145;Apparatus was equal to any in the Possession of a private Person in Britain&#146;  (<span class="italic">Exeter Flying Post</span>, 21 April 1775) and his charges had increased to a half-guinea for ten lectures.<br>
<br>In 1776 Warltire advertised courses of &#145;New Experiments upon Air&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bristol Journal</span>, 7 Sept 1776), in which he had been helped by William Withering (1741&#150;1799); the price was now 1 guinea for twelve lectures. Between 1777 and 1781 Priestley printed descriptions of some of Warltire's experiments, including one of 1776 when Warltire also noticed the deposit of moisture produced on the inside of a tube after the explosion of a mixture of air and inflammable gas (hydrogen). This contributed to the intense debate on the composition of water, and who had discovered it.<br>
<br>In 1777 Warltire first delivered lectures about Stonehenge at Salisbury, having observed the local source for sarsen stones and how the Friar's Heelstone marked where the sun rose on the longest day. Probably in the same year, Warltire's Bristol lectures stimulated William Gregor (1761&#150;1817), the discoverer of titanium, to take a first interest in chemistry. In 1778 Warltire subscribed to a book by fellow lecturer Thomas Malton. He gave a Wolverhampton address, suggesting that his long-suffering wife, at least, continued to live there. The following year, Warltire gave a new course on agricultural chemistry at Tamworth and he was now employed as personal chemistry tutor to John Wedgwood (1766&#150;1844) and Robert Waring Darwin (1766&#150;1848) at Etruria. In 1780 Warltire started another new course on metallurgy and mineralogy at Birmingham and was soon performing chemical analyses for friends. He was elected an early honorary member of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society in 1782.<br>
<br>In 1783 Warltire performed a vital piece of industrial espionage for James Watt (1736&#150;1819), when he obtained a drawing of Jonathan Hornblower's new compound steam engine at Radstock while lecturing nearby. His observation that Exeter was built on an extinct volcano seems the first properly geological observation to be reported to the Chapter House Philosophical Society in London, in 1785. In 1786 Warltire gave lectures at Salisbury with his travelling mineral collection. In 1791 these led to renewed, if abortive, attempts to find coal at Shaftesbury in Dorset.<br>
<br>Warltire took a long interest in Stonehenge, which he thought &#145;a vast Theodolite for observing the motions of the heavens&#146;  (J. Britton, <span class="italic">Beauties of Wiltshire</span>, 2, 1801, 121). By 1786 he and his son William had made accurate cork models, as it then was and as it had first been. Warltire brought Roman pavements near Warminster to public attention in 1786. In 1790 Warltire's wife died at Wolverhampton, and no lecture notices have been traced from then until 1797, when his health was reported in decline. His silence may have arisen from the danger of his association with Priestley, whose laboratory&#151;when destroyed in 1791&#151;included equipment constructed by Warltire.<br>
<br>Warltire returned to lecturing from 1798; his last known course was given at Ashbourne in 1809. He died at Bonehill, Tamworth, in August 1810 at &#145;a very advanced age&#146;  (<span class="italic">Derby Mercury</span>) and &#145;in great poverty&#146;  (Miller); burial records gave his age as eighty-four. The <span class="italic">Derby Mercury</span> unavailingly hoped for &#145;Memoirs of this distinguished and very useful character &hellip; and the publication of his very curious and original papers&#146; (which John Farey (1766&#150;1826) quoted with approval in 1813). Warltire was the itinerant science lecturer most closely associated with, and who reported the work of, the Lunar Society. His claimed Scottish degree has not been confirmed, but his MSS and fine apparatus passed into the hands of Richard Dalton of York, another itinerant lecturer of the next generation, who had lost many by 1827. Warltire was buried at Tamworth church on 23 August 1810.<br>
