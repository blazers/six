<span class="headword">Burgh,  Thomas</span>, Baron Burgh  (<em>c.</em>1430&#150;1496), <span class="occ">administrator and soldier</span>, was the eldest son of Thomas Burgh and Elizabeth, daughter and coheir of Sir Henry Percy of Harthill, Yorkshire. He inherited his mother's estates, including Gainsborough (Lincolnshire) and a moiety of the Mitford barony in Northumberland, on her death in 1455, when he was said to be aged twenty-four and more. His early political affiliations were with the Staffords: he was a member of the household of the duke of Buckingham in 1456&#150;7 and was one of the duke's feoffees in 1458. But after the duke's death at Northampton he appears to have made an early commitment to the victorious Yorkists, by whom he was made sheriff of Lincolnshire in autumn 1460. He was made an esquire of the body on 2 April 1461, just four days after the battle of Towton had confirmed Edward IV on the throne. He had been knighted by February 1463, and was master of the king's horse by February 1464. He was a knight of the body by 1466 and probably earlier. His rise in the king's service was accompanied by generous patronage, including forfeited land in Lincolnshire and elsewhere, and office within the duchy of Lancaster estates in Lincolnshire, notably the constableships of Lincoln Castle and of Bolingbroke.<br>
<br>Tensions created by Burgh's arrival as a force within the county contributed to the Lincolnshire rising of 1470. Unrest began with the sacking of Burgh's house at Gainsborough by Richard, Lord Welles, his son Robert and his brothers-in-law Sir Thomas de la Laund and Sir Thomas Dymmock, and escalated when it was rumoured that Edward planned to bring an army into the county to punish the offenders. Burgh was a crucial figure for Lincolnshire loyalties to the royal household under Edward IV, but his influence was eclipsed during the readeption of Henry VI until Edward's restoration in 1471 brought a return to power. In the French war his importance was reflected in his provision of 160 archers, no other knight of the body raising more than 100. Burgh transferred smoothly to the household of Richard III, retaining all his local offices. He received further patronage from the new king, including land worth &pound;200, and was elected a knight of the Garter. But he was never one of those closest to the king and he probably avoided the battle of Bosworth. The accession of Henry VII brought the loss of his gains from Richard III and of several of his Lincolnshire offices, but he remained a royal councillor (a post he had held under both Yorkist kings) and in 1487 received a personal summons to parliament, although there is no evidence that he took his seat in the Lords and in his will he describes himself simply as &#145;Thomas Burgh knight&#146;.<br>
<br>Burgh had married, by May 1464, Margaret, daughter of Thomas, Lord Ros, and widow of William, Lord Botreaux, who had died on 16 May 1462. She brought him extensive dower estates in Wiltshire, Somerset, and Dorset. She died on 10 December 1488. With her Burgh had two sons, Edward and Thomas, and two daughters, Elizabeth, who had married Richard, Lord Fitzhugh, by 21 May 1481, and Anne. In widowhood, Elizabeth was married in 1491 to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65025/', "Sir Henry Willoughby (c.1451&#150;1528)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52802/', "Willoughby family (per. 1362&#150;1528)")</script>]. Edward, Burgh's heir, was associated with his father in a grant of office in February 1469, and in 1477 married Anne Cobham, the widow of Edward Blount, Lord Mountjoy. By the time of his father's death Edward had three sons (Thomas, George, and Humphrey) and a daughter (Margaret). After a promising career he was judged lunatic in 1510 and died in 1528.<br>
<br>Burgh died on 18 March 1496 and willed burial in the new chapel he had built within the parish church of Gainsborough, where a perpetual chantry was to be founded for himself, his wife, and parents. He also endowed five bedesmen, to be chosen from his former servants, or, failing that, from his tenants in Gainsborough.<br>
