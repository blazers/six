<span class="headword">Westwood,  John Obadiah</span>  (1805&#150;1893), <span class="occ">entomologist and palaeographer</span>, was born on 22 December 1805 at Sheffield, the son of John Westwood (1774&#150;1850), a medal designer and die-sinker, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Edward Betts of Sheffield. Westwood was educated at the Society of Friends' school at Sheffield; in 1819 his family moved to Lichfield where he was educated at the grammar school; they later moved to Chelsea.<br>
<br>Westwood was first apprenticed as an engraver, but in the autumn of 1821 he was articled to a firm of solicitors in London, where he was briefly a partner. Of his arrival in London, Westwood declared that &#145;instead of studying Coke upon Lyttleton, I greedily devoured all the information to be obtained from Samouelle's <span class="italic">Compendium</span>, Haworth's <span class="italic">Lepidoptera Britannica</span>, Shaw's <span class="italic">Zoology</span>, and other similar works&#146;  (<span class="italic">Entomologist's Monthly Magazine</span>, 49). However, by the end of 1828 he had been enrolled as attorney of his majesty's court of king's bench at Westminster, attorney in common pleas, and solicitor in his majesty's high court of chancery.<br>
<br>Westwood began collecting insects from all orders at an early age, acquiring both native and foreign specimens. In later life he toured across Europe and Russia visiting libraries and collections. Having small private means, he preferred to devote himself to entomology and antiquarian pursuits, augmenting his income by writing and drawing and, in time, he became one of the greatest living authorities on Anglo-Saxon and medieval manuscripts. His drawings of insects were masterpieces of correct delineation, and he excelled in reproducing old manuscripts, illuminations, and representations of old ivories and inscribed stones.<br>
<br>In March 1824 Westwood first met the entomologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13718/', "Frederick William Hope (1797&#150;1862)")</script>. Hope, the first president of the Entomological Society, became Westwood's patron, and in August 1834 he engaged Westwood for one day each week to arrange his insect specimens. In 1839 Westwood married Eliza Richardson (<i>d</i>. 1882), who accompanied him on all his archaeological tours, and who assisted him in making sketches and rubbings of the inscribed stones for his <span class="italic">Lapidarium Walliae</span> (1876&#150;9).<br>
<br>About 1849 Hope decided to give his collections to Oxford University by a deed of gift officially accepted by convocation in April 1850. Hope was also keen to establish a new chair of zoology at Oxford, and in 1860 the Hope professorship of zoology was endowed. Hope's collections were transferred from Hammersmith (where Westwood also resided) to Oxford, but by 1855 he was worried about their condition. Thus in 1857 Westwood was appointed conservator of Hope's collections and, on 31 July of the same year, Westwood's own insect collection (having been purchased by Hope) was added to the Hopeian Museum. In January 1861 Westwood was nominated by Hope for the post of first Hope professor of zoology and in due course was appointed. In 1858 he joined Magdalen College, becoming a fellow in 1880.<br>
<br>Westwood was a prolific author. His antiquarian works included <span class="italic">Palaeographia sacra pictoria</span> (1843&#150;5), <span class="italic">Illuminated Illustrations of the Bible</span> (1846), <span class="italic">On the distinctive character of the &hellip; ornamentation employed by the early British Anglo-Saxon, and Irish artists</span> (1854), <span class="italic">A Descriptive Catalogue of the Fictile Ivories in the South Kensington Museum</span> (1876), <span class="italic">Lapidarium Walliae: the Early Inscribed and Sculptured Stones of Wales</span> (1876&#150;9), and <span class="italic">The Book of Kells: a Lecture</span> (1887). His most important entomological work was <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Modern Classification of Insects</span> (2 vols., 1839&#150;40). Other important works in this field included <span class="italic">The Entomologist's Text Book</span> (1838), <span class="italic">British Butterflies and their Transformations</span> (2 vols., 1841&#150;55), <span class="italic">The Butterflies of Great Britain</span> (1855; edn 1887), <span class="italic">Catalogue of Orthopterous Insects in the Collection of the British Museum. Part I. Phasmidae</span> (1859), and <span class="italic">Thesaurus entomologicus Oxoniensis, or, Illustrations of new, rare, and interesting insects, for the most part contained in the collections presented to the University of Oxford by the Rev. F. W. Hope</span> (1874). He also contributed to works by other naturalists and published more than 350 papers.<br>
<br>Although Westwood received no formal training as an artist, he produced illustrations for J. F. Stephen's <span class="italic">Illustrations of British Entomology</span> (1828&#150;46), F. W. Hope's <span class="italic">Coleopterist's Manual</span> (1837&#150;40), and T. V. Wollaston's <span class="italic">Insecta Maderensia</span> (1854). He produced new editions, and contributed notes to a number of works, including D. Drury's <span class="italic">Illustrations of Exotic Entomology</span> (3 vols., 1837) and M. Harris's <span class="italic">The Aurelian: a Natural History of English Moths</span> (1840). The name <i>Westwoodia</i> was bestowed in his honour by Brull&eacute; in 1846 on a genus of Hymenoptera, and his name was similarly employed by C. S. Bate in 1857 for Crustacea, and by Kaufs in 1866 and Castelnau in 1873 for Coleoptera.<br>
<br>In his time, Westwood's work &#145;forged a bridge between entomologists and gardeners&#146;  (Clark, 210). He was on the staff of the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span> for nearly half a century as entomological referee, and in this journal, and the <span class="italic">Agricultural Gazette</span>, he published a series of articles around 1860, disputing Darwin's theories of evolution and natural selection. Moreover, Westwood, like many of his contemporaries, was unable to accept the doctrine of evolution and remained a staunch anti-Darwinist to the end, although he did live to see the subject taught at his university.<br>
<br>Westwood was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society on 1 May 1827, and was on the honorary list of nearly every entomological society of his period. He had co-operated actively in founding the Entomological Society of London in 1833, and was honorary secretary from 1834 until 1847 (from 1836 to 1843 he also held the post of honorary curator). He was president of the society for three terms (1851&#150;2, 1872&#150;3, 1876&#150;7), and edited the society's <span class="italic">Transactions</span>. In 1883 he was elected honorary life president. His work <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Modern Classification of Insects</span> (1838&#150;40) gained him the Royal Society's gold medal in 1855, and although frequently urged to become a candidate for fellowship to the society he declined the offers. He was also made an honorary member of the London Vaccine Institution in 1833, and the emperor of Brazil, Pedro II, made Westwood a knight of the imperial order of the rose.<br>
<br>About 1884, a bad fall caused damage to Westwood's left arm, and prevented the pursuit of his studies. By 1892 he was confined to a bath chair, and on 2 January 1893 he died at his residence, 141 Woodstock Road, Oxford. He was buried at St Sepulchre's cemetery, Jericho, Oxford. In 1893 a vestry was erected at St Andrew's Church, Sandford-on-Thames, in his memory.<br>
