<span class="headword">Callcott,  John Wall</span>  (1766&#150;1821), <span class="occ">composer and music teacher</span>, was born on 20 November 1766 at The Mall, Kensington Gravel Pits, London, the son of Thomas Callcott, builder, and his second wife, Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wall; his brother was the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4397/', "Sir Augustus Wall Callcott")</script>. From the age of seven John Callcott was a pupil at a school near his home run by William Young, where he was said to have been a brilliant student of the classics, Hebrew, and philosophy. He was obliged to leave at the age of twelve because of family circumstances and was subsequently self-taught.<br>
<br>Callcott's early musical education, from 1778, was with Henry Whitney, organist of Kensington parish church. His father bought a spinet for him in 1779, and he later took up the clarinet and the oboe. In 1780 he wrote music for a Christmas play at Young's school. In 1782, through his attendance at Westminster Abbey, he became acquainted with Benjamin Cooke and Samuel Arnold, who encouraged him to enter the musical profession. From 1782 he occasionally played in the orchestra of the Academy of Ancient Music as a &#145;supernumerary hautboy&#146;, and sang in the chorus of the oratorio concerts at Drury Lane Theatre. In 1783, on the recommendation of Thomas Attwood, he became deputy organist under Rheinhold of St George the Martyr, Queen Square, Bloomsbury, a post he held until 1785.<br>
<br>Most of Callcott's early compositions were glees. For much of the 1780s he dominated the annual Catch Club competitions, gaining fame for the number of his entries which won gold medals and notoriety for the single-mindedness of his approach to the competition. His first glee, &#145;O sovereign of the willing soul&#146;, which he entered in 1784, was unsuccessful, but he won three out of the four prizes in 1785, and two prizes in each of the two following years. In 1787 he submitted no fewer than 120 entries, and the club subsequently passed a resolution limiting the number of entries by any competitor to twelve. Offended by this change in the rules, Callcott refused to compete in 1788, but he entered again in 1789 and won all four prizes. Between 1790 and 1793, after which the competition was abolished altogether, he entered each year and won a further nine prizes.<br>
<br>Callcott took the Oxford BMus degree on 4 July 1785. In 1787 he was involved with Arnold in the formation of the Glee Club. On 2 November 1788 he was elected to membership of the Royal Society of Musicians. In 1789 he was appointed joint organist with C. S. Evans of St Paul's, Covent Garden. In 1793 he was appointed organist to the Asylum for Female Orphans in Lambeth, a post which he held until 1802, when he resigned it to his future son-in-law and memorialist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13821/', "William Horsley")</script>. On 18 June 1800 he took the Oxford DMus degree.<br>
<br>Callcott married Elizabeth Mary Hutchins at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 14 July 1791. They had eleven children, all of whom had Hutchins as their second forename. Elizabeth (1793&#150;1875), their eldest daughter, married Horsley in 1813. Sophia (<i>b</i>. 1794) was a piano teacher and organist of St Mary Abbots, Kensington. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4400/', "William Hutchins Callcott")</script> was a prolific composer, organist, and teacher of music. <a name="cosubject_46766"></a><span class="headword">Maria Hutchins Callcott</span>  (1798&#150;1859) was the <span class="occ">author</span> of a number of &#145;improving&#146; works, most of them published by the SPCK. They included <span class="italic">The Singer's Alphabet</span> (1849), <span class="italic">Daily Charity</span> and <span class="italic">The Power of Meekness</span> (both 1853), and <span class="italic">A Few Household Hints, and Lessons of Conduct for Female Servants</span> (1856). She died of liver disease on 3 April 1859 at 10 Campden Grove, Kensington, London.<br>
<br>As he grew older, Callcott's interests increasingly turned from composition to questions of theory. His interest developed through his friendship with Marmaduke Overend, organist of Isleworth. On Overend's death in 1790 Callcott bought all his manuscripts, including all his compositions and the manuscript writings on harmony of William Boyce, which Overend had acquired after Boyce's death in 1779. Callcott's ambitious plans for a comprehensive dictionary of music, for which he issued a prospectus in 1797 but which he never completed, involved him in many years of study of theoretical writings and mathematical and philosophical treatises relating to music, all undertaken in addition to his heavy teaching and other commitments. He also worked on an alphabetical dictionary of composers, which he was able to complete only as far as the letter O. Work on these projects ceased in 1808, when Callcott suffered a breakdown, but Horsley in his <span class="italic">Memoir</span> doubted if he would in any case ever have completed them, remarking that &#145;habit had rendered the accumulation of materials a pleasing task for him, but he always appeared to shrink from the labour of arranging them&#146;  (Horsley, 11).<br>
<br>Callcott's activities around the turn of the century were many and varied. About 1799 he published <span class="italic">The Sentences, Psalms, Hymns, and Anthems, as Sung at the Asylum Chapel</span> and in 1801, anonymously, an elementary English grammar and dictionary, <span class="italic">The Way to Speak Well, Made Easy for Youth</span>. In 1802 he wrote the anthem &#145;I heard a voice from heaven&#146;, which was sung at the funeral of Samuel Arnold on 29 October; soon afterwards he applied unsuccessfully for Arnold's post as composer to George III. In 1806, &#145;thinking that the public would be led to expect something from him, on the Theory of Music&#146;  (Horsley, 10), he published his <span class="italic">Musical Grammar</span>. This became his best-known work, and went into two further editions in 1809 and 1817, the first revised by Samuel Wesley and the second by Horsley; it broke no new ground in its approach or contents, but was a valuable instruction manual on harmony and counterpoint and continued to be used for many years. He also found time to be active in the local militia: he had taken a commission in the Kensington volunteer corps in 1795, and in 1801 founded a military band, buying instruments, composing, compiling, and arranging the music, and teaching the musicians.<br>
<br>In early 1808 Callcott began to give a course of lectures on music at the Royal Institution. In April that year, however, he suffered a serious nervous collapse, possibly brought on by overwork, and on 30 May he was admitted to the asylum of Dr Joseph Mason Cox (1763&#150;1818) at Fishponds, near Bristol. By 1813 he had recovered sufficiently to resume some of his former activities, but he gave up any plans to complete his dictionary of music. He suffered another collapse in 1816 and was once more confined to the Fishponds Asylum, where he spent the remaining years of his life. He died there on 15 May 1821, and was buried in Kensington churchyard on 23 May.<br>
<br>Callcott's significance is twofold: as one of the greatest and most prolific English glee composers, and as a musical theorist. In addition, as is clear from all contemporary accounts, he was held in high esteem and regarded with great affection by all who knew him. The benefit concert organized by his professional colleagues on 7 April 1809 was so well supported that it had to be moved from the Hanover Square Rooms to the King's Theatre; on this occasion nearly 4000 tickets were sold, and 1500 guineas were raised for Callcott's family. Further well-supported benefit concerts were held on 22 February 1813 and 3 May 1819. Three years after his death a lavish three-volume selection of his principal vocal works was published by subscription by Horsley for the benefit of his widow and family. The subscription list, headed by the duke of Cambridge and the duchess of Gloucester, included over 360 names, bearing witness to the strength of Callcott's continuing posthumous reputation.<br>
