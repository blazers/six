<span class="headword">Young,  James</span>  (1811&#150;1883), <span class="occ">chemist and philanthropist</span>, was born on 13 July 1811 at Drygate, Glasgow, the eldest son of John Young, a self-employed carpenter, and his wife, Jean Wilson (married on 9 February 1809). Young worked for his father and in 1830 began to attend the evening lectures in chemistry of Professor Thomas Graham, at Anderson's University. By the session of 1831&#150;2 he had become Graham's laboratory assistant. He also became the friend of David Livingstone and Lyon Playfair, made the acquaintance of many sons of industrialists, and in 1834 began giving lectures for Graham to the mechanics' class. He was presented with an inscribed silver watch by this class in 1836 and, when he was about to leave on 28 June 1837 to join Graham at University College, London, he was also given a testimonial. His first scientific paper, dated 4 January 1837 and published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, described a miniature voltaic battery, a modification of Faraday's invention.<br>
<br>On 21 August 1838 Young married his cousin, Mary Young, and thereafter he began to seek better-paid employment outside academic life. In 1839 he became manager of James Muspratt &amp; Sons at Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire. Muspratt's sons, Sheridan (who had been at Anderson's University) and James, were laboratory students at University College and it was through the latter that an initial offer of &pound;140 per year and a house (Alkali Cottage, St Helens) was made to Young in October 1838. Young was involved in the layout of the plant and became its technical director; his first patent for the production of ammonia (11 November 1841) was an industrial application of his earlier work in Graham's laboratory. Young joined Tennant, Clow &amp; Co. on 12 January 1844 as manager of their Ardwick Bridge chemical works in Manchester. Tennants paid its managerial staff well and allowed them to patent processes, to act as consultants to customers, and to undertake business ventures on their own behalf, provided there was no conflict of interest. Young made improvements to methods of production at a number of their plants. In 1844 he produced a cheaper indigo dye and in 1848 he patented a method of producing sodium and potassium stannate from tinstone.<br>
<br>Young, a Liberal radical, joined the Manchester branch of the Anti-Corn Law League in 1844 and was so dissatisfied with the politics of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> that he helped to found the <span class="italic">Manchester Examiner</span> (1846) under the editorship of Thomas Ballantyne. A member of the Manchester Mechanics' Institute, he served in 1845 on a committee established by the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society to investigate the Irish potato blight, and compiled its report. Young was elected to the society on 19 October 1847, having already organized a chemical group which became a section. His first paper to the society concerned the health of towns and the need to deodorize cesspools using chloride of manganese.<br>
<br>On 3 December 1847 Lyon Playfair wrote to Young, telling him of a petroleum spring yielding 300 gallons daily in the Riddings colliery near Alfreton, Derbyshire, on the estate of his brother-in-law, James Oakes. Young visited Riddings in December 1847 and conducted experiments. Thereafter he suggested to Tennants that the firm might refine this petroleum, but they decided that the likely scale of operations was too small. James Oakes then suggested that with his help Young should establish his own refinery, an arrangement to which Tennants agreed. The main customers bought lubricants, and the textile firms soon realized the products' advantages and relative cheapness. Young erroneously thought that the Riddings petroleum had been condensed from the coal and deposited in the strata above. He therefore began to experiment with the dry distillation of coal at various temperatures and, having explored the characteristics of the main oil-bearing coals and shales, he enrolled the crucial patent for this process on 17 October 1850.<br>
<br>The best material was torbanite, a geological curiosity found in the coal measures near Bathgate and first mined as Boghead coal; Young and his partners, E. W. Binney, a Manchester lawyer, and Edward Meldrum, opened an oilworks in 1851 2 miles from the pithead, having secured an exclusive contract from James Russel &amp; Son, the mineral lessees. The first products were naphtha (used as a solvent) and various lubricants, but by 1855 paraffin for lamps had become most profitable; paraffin wax was not sold until 1856 and in quantity for candles only from 1859. Any attempt to maintain secrecy about production was vitiated by the litigation (1853) brought by the owners of the Torbane Hill estate, Mr and Mrs William Gillespie, against Russels, on the grounds that torbanite was not coal and therefore not included in their lease. Profit margins were discussed in court and were so wide as to encourage patent infringements and competition. Fortunately for Young the Gillespies lost their case, but further legal actions were necessary to sustain the patent. Young was successful in winning costs and damages against Stephen White and others (1854), the Clydesdale Chemical Company (1860&#150;61), John Miller &amp; Co., and William Miller &amp; Co. (1861). The greatest test, which ended in the House of Lords, was the case against Ebenezer Fernie, William Carter, and Joseph Robinson (1862&#150;4), which resulted in costs of &pound;10,000 and damages of &pound;11,422 in Young's favour.<br>
<br>Yet Young's reluctance to grant licences and the gradual discovery of cheaper but lower-yielding oil shales stimulated the growth of competition; by the time his British patent expired in 1864, there was a Scottish oil mania, and by 1870 ninety-seven firms had been established, most of them since 1859. American petroleum and kerosene firms also used Young's process and after 1862 brought more competition to European markets. Young broke with his partners in 1864 and established a new works at Addiewell before launching Young's Paraffin Light and Mineral Oil Company with a capital of &pound;600,000 (1866).<br>
<br>By 1870 &#145;Paraffin Young&#146;, as he had become known, had retired from business and gradually reduced his shareholding in his limited company. He spent his time on science, leisure, and philanthropy. An active supporter of a channel tunnel, he conducted experiments on the velocity of light, and he was very interested in the practical development of electric light and the telephone. Elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1861) and the Royal Society (1873), he had a fine collection of works on alchemy and the early history of chemistry. A trustee of Anderson's University from 1858, he became a manager and its president (1868&#150;77), endowing the Young chair of technical chemistry and the Young Laboratory, and making many other gifts. Active in the British Association for the Advancement of Science, he was a member of the Chemical Society and its vice-president from 1879 to 1881. The University of St Andrews conferred the degree of LLD upon him in 1879. He gave statues of David Livingstone and Thomas Graham to the city of Glasgow, and despite colour-blindness he was a keen collector of Dutch and Flemish art. He sailed far and wide on his steam yacht, <i>Nyanza</i>, and farmed three estates, Limefield (Linlithgowshire), Durris (Kincardineshire), and Kelly (Renfrewshire), where he spent most of his latter years. Young's friendship with Livingstone led to his financial support for Livingstone's second and third expeditions to Zanzibar and for the search expedition. He also brought Livingstone's servants to Britain to clarify details of the last days of the explorer, and he acted as guardian to Livingstone's children. A Presbyterian in religion, he was generally tolerant in his approach to other faiths and gave widely to a range of good causes. He died a widower at Kelly House, Wemyss Bay, Renfrewshire, on 13 May 1883, and was buried at Inverkip cemetery. He was survived by three sons and four daughters and left a gross estate of &pound;165,000.<br>
