<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Whistler,  Daniel</span>  (1618/19&#150;1684), <span class="occ">physician</span>, son of William Whistler, gentleman of Elvington, Goring, Oxfordshire, was born at Walthamstow, Essex. He was educated at the free school of Thame, Oxfordshire, and matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, on 12 June 1635, aged sixteen. He graduated BA in 1639, became a fellow of Merton College in 1640, and on 8 August 1642 began studying medicine at Leiden. He returned to Oxford to take his MA in 1644, in which year he became a member of Gray's Inn, London, and spent time with William Harvey (1578&#150;1657), then warden of Merton, before returning to Leiden, where he graduated MD on 19 October 1645. He incorporated his Leiden MD at Oxford on 20 May 1647, decamped soon after for London, and was elected professor of geometry at Gresham College on 13 June 1648. He became superior Linacre reader at Oxford about the time of his Gresham appointment, though he did not deliver the lectures. He was elected a fellow of the College of Physicians on 13 December 1649. During 1653&#150;4 he and an Oxford colleague, Ralph Bathurst (<i>d</i>. 1704), cared for seamen, wounded in the Dutch war, at Ipswich, Harwich, and possibly London.<br>
<br>In 1653 Whistler served as physician to Bulstrode Whitelocke's embassy to Sweden, which he commemorated with Latin verses on the abdication of Queen Kristina that were printed in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Swedish Ambassy</span>. In July 1654 he returned to London and developed a lucrative practice. He may have been the Daniel Whistler who, on 7 April 1656, married Elizabeth Lowther at Little Ilford, Essex, at which time he resigned his Gresham professorship. At the College of Physicians he delivered the Harveian oration in 1659 and served twelve terms as censor between 1657 and 1680; he also served as college registrar in 1674&#150;82, elect from 1676, treasurer in 1682, and president in 1683. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1663 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/59221', "Founder members of the Royal Society")</script>].<br>
<br>Whistler completed his major intellectual project, <span class="italic">De morbo puerili Anglorum, quem patrio idiomate indigenae vocant &#145;The rickets&#146;</span> (1645) at the age of twenty-six as a thesis for his Leiden MD. During the 1640s the disease of rickets, which may have accounted for as many as 3 per cent of English deaths (bills of mortality for 1659: 476 of 15,000 burials; cited in Walter Langdon-Brown, <span class="italic">Some Chapters in Cambridge Medical History</span>, 1946, 35), aroused the interest of several English physicians and natural philosophers, including an informal study group of seven from the College of Physicians. Whistler's text is the first printed book devoted to rickets, but it is highly theoretical, contains little original material, and did not influence contemporaries. In contrast, the college project which culminated in Francis Glisson's influential 1650 publication <span class="italic">Tractatus de rachitide</span> of 416 pages was soon republished in several Latin and English editions.<br>
<br>Whistler seems to have been a man of charming manners and considerable talent, but he died facing imminent disgrace. While Pepys, who dined with him several times, wrote that he was &#145;good company, and a very ingenious man&#146; and John Evelyn found him exceedingly pleasant in manner, Whistler performed negligently as registrar of the College of Physicians. At the time of his death in London from fever and pneumonia on 11 May 1684 he was living at the college, then in Warwick Lane. He was buried in the north aisle of Christ Church Greyfriars, London. Shortly after his death, Whistler's former colleagues in the college became convinced that he had defrauded it of substantial sums. Wood observed that although Whistler earned &pound;1000 per year from his medical practice and was married to a rich widow, &#145;yet he died very much in debt&#146;. In 1704 Mr Boulter gave a portrait of him to the college, a gesture its nineteenth-century chronicler believed placed Whistler &#145;in company too good for his deserts&#146;  (Munk, 251).<br>
