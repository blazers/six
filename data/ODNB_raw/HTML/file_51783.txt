<span class="headword">Wood,  Mary Hay</span>  (1868&#150;1934), <span class="occ">educationist and college head</span>, was born at 267 Camden Road, Holloway, London, on 17 April 1868, the fifth daughter of Arthur John Wood (1821&#150;1896), barrister and secretary to the statute law revision commission, and his wife, Elizabeth Nisbet Nicolson. Educated at North London Collegiate School (1875&#150;86) under Frances Buss, she was the ablest in a family of high achievers and later one of North London Collegiate's most distinguished old pupils. An 1886 Goldsmith's scholar at Girton College, where her elder sister, Emily Elizabeth Wood, had been a student, Mary Wood gained a lower second in the 1889 classical tripos and the Gibson prize in 1895. In 1905 she completed a London MA thesis, <span class="italic">Plato's Psychology and its Bearing on the Development of the Will</span>, published in New York in 1907, when she was also awarded a DLitt from Trinity College, Dublin. A love of classics remained paramount throughout her life, and in 1929 she was invited to address the Psychological Congress at Yale on Plato.<br>
<br>Between 1890 and 1891 Mary Wood taught at Blair Lodge School for Boys, Stirlingshire, then returned to North London Collegiate as visiting classics mistress, also teaching part-time at the Clergy Orphans' School in St John's Wood. By 1892 she was at North London Collegiate full time, revered as an outstanding member of staff. In 1904 she became lecturer in pedagogy at St Mary's College, Paddington. Subsequently head of St Mary's training department and later vice-principal, she was an inspirational and charismatic teacher.<br>
<br>In 1908 Mary Wood was appointed principal of the Cambridge Training College for Women, in Wollaston Road, which, although small and financially insecure, had acquired a high reputation since its foundation in 1885 as the first residential training college for women secondary teachers. She was a wise and patient negotiator, seeking to improve opportunities for women in the profession, campaigning for more graduate trainees, and highlighting the need for secondary teacher training. Faced with the continual problem of securing sufficient secondary school placements for teaching practice, Mary Wood defended the college's use of private preparatory schools as unavoidable. This followed criticisms in a 1928 report by HM inspectorate that staff in these establishments had poor academic qualifications. A highly successful administrator, she also found time to lecture and hold personal supervisions. Under her guidance the student intake steadily increased after the First World War. The term &#145;post-graduate&#146; was added to the college title and its standing was consolidated and enhanced, bringing it into the front rank of teacher training institutions.<br>
<br>Mary Wood retained a large circle of friends and associates. Deeply religious, she was renowned for her scholarship, good advice, and skilful management, her warmth, her unstinting praise for colleagues, and her tremendous capacity for enjoyment. She was an ideal model for prospective teachers to emulate, with no greater tribute to her success than the excellent relationship she enjoyed with her staff. She was a founder, and first chair in 1920, of the Hillcroft College for Working Women, remaining actively involved until her death. A manager of Harrow Road School (1905&#150;8), she was also governor of the Frances Mary Buss and Church Education Corporation schools, and twice president of the Cambridge branch of the British Federation of University Women. She was much involved in the city's activities in Cambridge, particularly those concerning women. A small figure who cycled everywhere fast, physically she changed little over the years; her voice and laughter remained infectious and unmistakable, her handwriting impetuous.<br>
<br>In June 1933 Mary Wood retired from Cambridge and planned to use her &pound;120 retirement gift to travel to India, but in December 1933 discovered she had cancer. Characteristically, she donated the money to the college loan fund for needy students. Mary Wood died on 1 June 1934 at her home, 17 Oval Road, Regent's Park, London, and a memorial service was held at St Mary's, Lancaster Gate, in December. Subsequently the Wood memorial lectures were established in her honour.<br>
