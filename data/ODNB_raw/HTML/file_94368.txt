<span class="headword">Henry,  Jabez</span>  (1775&#150;1835), <span class="occ">colonial judge and writer on conflict of laws</span>, was born in London on 3 February 1775, the only son of Thomas Henry of Dublin. A pupil at Mr Simpson's school, London, he went to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, as a scholar, matriculating in 1803 and graduating BA in 1806, when he was admitted at the Middle Temple. He was called to the bar in 1809.<br>
<br>Henry's first judicial appointment in 1813 took him to the West Indies. For three years he served as president of the court of the united colonies of Demerara and Essequibo, recently acquired from the Dutch. His observations of the local economy, with its valuable plantations, slave society, and frequent outbursts of civil disorder, shaped the remainder of his professional life and interests. In 1817 he published <span class="italic">An Essay on the Roman Law of Manumission of Slaves, and its Application to the Colonies</span>. This was followed in 1821 by his <span class="italic">Report on the Criminal Law at Demerara and in the Ceded Dutch Colonies</span>, with an &#145;Appendix on the nature of the office of fiscal&#146;. In the latter work he severely criticized the archaic nature of the criminal process which, he complained, allowed prisoners on remand before trial, mostly slaves, to be locked up almost indefinitely; the practice had already been abolished in the Netherlands.<br>
<br>In 1817 Henry was transferred to the Adriatic to become chief judge at Corfu and in the Ionian Islands, where he encountered the Venetian legal system. While he was returning home via Rome in 1819 his advice was taken regarding the city's judicial system. In September 1820 he was back in Italy as leader of the team given the delicate task of interviewing witnesses who might rebut charges of misconduct that had been brought by George IV against his estranged wife, Queen Caroline.<br>
<br>The only reported decision of Henry as a judge was given in May 1814, a version of which was published in 1820 by John Buck in his <span class="italic">Cases in Bankruptcy</span>. In <i>Odwin v. Forbes</i>, Henry, after a masterly study of Anglo-Dutch cross-border insolvency practice, held that a local creditor was not at liberty in Demerara to sue a debtor who had obtained a discharge from an English bankruptcy in respect of a debt provable in those proceedings.<br>
<br>Permanently back in London with chambers at 3 Pump Court, and described in the <span class="italic">Law List</span> as &#145;conveyancer for the Dutch colonies&#146;, Henry proceeded to specialize in the increasingly important subject of private international law. Fluent in Dutch and Italian, and with good French, he visited Amsterdam and Paris collecting material for his next book, acquiring a copy of Johannes van der Linden's manual of Dutch law, first published in 1806, and works by other respected continental jurists. The result was the appearance in 1823 of what is conveniently known as <span class="italic">Henry's Foreign Law</span>. In this pioneering work aimed at common lawyers Henry discussed the chaotic, confusing, and almost incomprehensible nature of various civil law systems relating to the conflict of laws. The work also contains an extended version of the judgment in <i>Odwin v. Forbes</i> together with the texts of a neglected group of eight opinions given by counsel in London between 1711 and 1717 concerning the prospects of Dutch insolvency proceedings being recognized and enforced in England. <span class="italic">Foreign Law</span> was well received, especially in the United States.<br>
<br>Following <span class="italic">Foreign Law</span>, probably in 1825, Henry published a pamphlet of fourteen pages, <span class="italic">Outline of a Plan of an International Bankruptcy Code for the Different Commercial States of Europe</span>. Such a convention was needed, Henry argued, to fight fraud, reduce delays, and curtail expense, but above all to achieve justice in a complex and increasingly important sphere of commercial activity. In 1828 Henry mentioned his idea to the distinguished New York lawyer Henry Wheaton, who dismissed it as quite impracticable.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, encouraged by Lord Bathurst, the colonial secretary, Henry had embarked on an ambitious translation of van der Linden, which was published in 1828 as <span class="italic">Institutes of the Laws of Holland</span>. The work was primarily intended for the expanding market of English lawyers, civil servants, and colonial administrators employed in the former Dutch possessions where Roman-Dutch law was still applicable. Besides Demerara, they included such major acquisitions as Ceylon and the Cape of Good Hope. The book is especially valuable for its lengthy chapter &#145;On the formation of a select law library&#146;. Henry's own original library had been lost in a shipwreck on his Ionian travels.<br>
<br>In 1824 Henry sailed again for the Caribbean where, as part of a small team, he conducted an official inquiry into the administration of justice in the West Indies and South American colonies. The commission's huge and detailed reports were presented to parliament in July 1825, March 1826, and December 1826; a summary was published in 1827. Between 1822 and 1831 Henry remained in close touch with Sir Robert Wilmot-Horton, colonial under-secretary until 1828, providing him in November 1827 with an opinion on the Spanish law of manumission.<br>
<br>Henry, according to an obituary in the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, had an extensive circle of friends and was respected as an upright, honourable man, with a kind and humane disposition. On 15 May 1823 he attended a fund-raising event at the Crown and Anchor tavern for Greek independence; at the end of July 1828, through the introduction of his friend J. T. Bowring, he dined with Jeremy Bentham. Henry's last publication was a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Manifesto of a Neutral</span>, which appeared in February 1835, a few days before he suffered a serious stroke. He died at his home, 11 Great Ormond Street, London, on 1 September 1835, leaving a widow and several sons and daughters. His eldest daughter, Elizabeth Anne, married the botanist Arthur Henfrey.<br>
<br>Henry's concept of an international insolvency law ultimately became a reality in 2002 with the implementation of a European bankruptcy convention: he can justly be regarded as its spiritual father.<br>
