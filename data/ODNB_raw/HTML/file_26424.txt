<span class="headword">Stevens,  Richard John Samuel</span>  (1757&#150;1837), <span class="occ">composer and diarist</span>, was born on 27 March 1757 at the Garden House, Bell Alley, Coleman Street, London, the first of four children of John Stevens (<i>d</i>. 1778), a cloth drawer and member of the Haberdashers' Company, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Chippendale. Stevens was noted by his contemporaries as an organist and composer of glees (vocal compositions for three or more singers with or without accompaniment). His main historical significance lies in his diaries, commonplace books, &#145;Recollections&#146;, and incomplete account books, which give a vivid picture of the life of a financially successful professional musician in late Georgian London. The &#145;Recollections&#146; are also the only source to identify John Stafford Smith as the composer of the &#145;Anacreontic Song&#146;, whose tune is now familiar as &#145;The Star-Spangled Banner&#146;, the national anthem of the United States of America, and which was originally the club song of the Anacreontic Society.<br>
<br>Stevens was a chorister at St Paul's Cathedral, and in 1768 was apprenticed to William Savage, vicar-choral and master of the choristers. In 1778 he began to teach music to the daughters of Lord Thurlow (lord chancellor in 1778&#150;83 and 1783&#150;92), and Thurlow became an important patron for Stevens, whose career was also much helped by his friendship with Samuel Birch. Stevens's major appointments were as organist to St Michael Cornhill (1781&#150;1810), the Inner Temple (1786&#150;1810), the Charterhouse (1796&#150;1837), and Christ's Hospital (1808&#150;10), and as Gresham professor of music (1801&#150;37). His &#145;Recollections&#146; include descriptions of many of the glee-singing clubs of London, including the Noblemen and Gentlemen's Catch Club (where he was a professional member), the Anacreontic Society, and many smaller organizations.<br>
<br>On 7 June 1810 Stevens married Anna Maria Jeffery (1768&#150;1847), daughter of George Jeffery of London and Peckham, and they had one child, Richard, born in 1811. Anna Maria had become one of Stevens's pupils in 1788, and he first proposed to her (unsuccessfully) in 1799. Allusions in the diaries and &#145;Recollections&#146; suggest that this long delay was because members of the Jeffery family objected to the elder daughter's marrying beneath herself. By the time of the wedding Stevens had already relinquished most of his teaching and the Jeffery family also required him to resign most of his other musical appointments. He was saved from possible financial embarrassment by a substantial bequest from Thomas Rivers, one of his father's friends, in 1817. His closest friends were successful members of his own class, Joseph Kirckman the piano maker, and tea merchant Richard Twining the younger (1772&#150;1857).<br>
<br>Stevens's most important musical compositions were his glees, of which &#145;See what horrid tempests rise&#146; and &#145;It was a lover and his lass&#146; won prizes from the Catch Club in 1782 and 1786 respectively, while a further five glees and one catch appeared in the Catch Club's annual collections. Some of his glees, such as these prize-winning compositions, are fine examples of the rather conservative style associated with the glee-singing clubs. Stevens also had a lively interest in new musical developments. He orchestrated some of his glees for use in the theatre, and his more innovative pieces include &#145;Pray pull the bell sir&#146;, which is a miniature piece of music theatre, glees with piano duet accompaniment, such as &#145;O strike the harp&#146;, and more clearly homophonic pieces which embrace sonata form, such as &#145;Ye spotted snakes&#146;.<br>
<br>Stevens declined an invitation to join the teaching staff of the Royal Academy of Music when it was founded in 1814, but he left most of his sheet music to them after his death in Peckham on 23 September 1837. His manuscripts remained in the family until 1957, when the music was left to the Fitzwilliam Museum and other papers to the Pendlebury Library (both in Cambridge).<br>
