<span class="headword">Goyder,  George Woodroffe</span>  (1826&#150;1898), <span class="occ">surveyor</span>, was born on 29 January 1826 in Liverpool, third son and fourth of eight children of David George Goyder (1796&#150;1878), doctor and Swedenborgian minister, and his wife, Sarah Etherington (1794&#150;1886). Educated at Glasgow high school, Goyder worked for firms making precision and surveying instruments in Glasgow, Liverpool, and Warrington. He migrated to Sydney, New South Wales, in 1848, and to Adelaide, South Australia, in 1850, as a government draughtsman. In January 1851 he joined the lands and survey department, and on 10 December married, in the Anglican pro-cathedral, Christ Church, North Adelaide, Frances Mary Smith (1825&#150;1870), daughter of John Smith, who had come to Adelaide from Bristol in 1849. His dedication to his work often parted them. About August 1853 he became a chief clerk, in January 1857 assistant surveyor-general, and on 29 May 1861 surveyor-general. He held this post for thirty-three years, and was thus &#145;king of the Lands Department&#146; when it was South Australia's most important department, and when the colony's chief public activities were land exploration and settlement, and debating whether to favour large landholders or small.<br>
<br>Goyder travelled tirelessly, each year riding thousands of miles, often at his own expense, to supervise his field staff and to value or survey land. In June 1857 he wrongly reported the Lake Torrens region in South Australia's north to be well watered; he was misled by floodwaters from further north. In 1866 he published a map showing the southern limit of those pastoral runs which needed rent relief because of recurrent drought. &#145;Goyder's line&#146; still effectively divides South Australia into agricultural and pastoral land, but from 1874 aspiring farmers crossed it to grow wheat in the north. In the few wet years that followed they did well; when the normal dry years returned they were forced from their farms.<br>
<br>In 1868&#150;9 Goyder took 131 men by sea to the Northern Territory, then under South Australia's jurisdiction, to select a site for a capital. He recommended Palmerston (now Darwin) on Port Darwin, surveyed the site and a further 665,000 acres, and wrote an extensive report on the region's pastoral, agricultural, and mineral potential. He was by then considered the colony's ablest public servant. His travelling, voluminous official writing, and command of his multiplying tasks earned him the nickname Little Energy. He had been inspector of mines and valuator of runs since 1861. In 1874, as the colony's railway system began a rapid expansion, he became chairman of the railways commission. In 1875 he was chief of those who established a forest board, perhaps the first in the empire, for the economic management of trees, and until 1881 was its chairman. He saw the value of water regulation, introducing a wide range of storage and drainage measures. He drew a model town plan, based on Adelaide's, on which most of the 160 South Australian towns laid down in his time were established. He combined such wide-ranging activities with meeting ceaseless demands for closer settlement surveys until he retired on 30 June 1894.<br>
<br>Goyder possessed the essential qualities of a pioneer: energy, judgement, health, and a good eye for ground. He was strict but fair, and most of his subordinates liked him; and while anyone connected with the disposal of public land will make enemies, in October 1894 his fellow colonists showed their regard by giving him 1000 sovereigns. He was appointed CMG in January 1889. His wife died on 8 April 1870 in Bristol, England, of an accidental overdose of laudanum; they had nine children. On 20 November 1871 he married, in St Luke's Church, Adelaide, her sister, Ellen Priscilla Smith (1834&#150;1899); they had a son and twin daughters. Goyder died of cerebral embolism at Warrakilla, his home at Biggs Flat, near Adelaide, on 2 November 1898, and was buried in Stirling cemetery, Adelaide.<br>
