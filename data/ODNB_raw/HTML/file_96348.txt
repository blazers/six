<span class="headword">Trimmingham <span class="st"> [Trimingham]</span>,  Ernest</span>  (1880/81&#150;1942), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in Bermuda. As yet, little is known of his early life, or of when he settled in Britain. His first known appearance&#151;and the first known appearance of a black actor in a British film&#151;was in <span class="italic">The Adventures of Dick Turpin: the King of Highwaymen</span> (1912), in which he played a character called Beetles alongside Percy Moran's Turpin. Produced by the British and Colonial Kinematograph Company, the film was popular, and led to a series. Trimmingham appeared again in the third instalment, <span class="italic">The Adventures of Dick Turpin: 200 Guineas Reward, Dead or Alive</span>. In the romantic drama <span class="italic">Her Bachelor Guardian</span>, also released in 1912, he was listed in the cast simply as &#145;Negro&#146;. Before this point it was usual for black characters to be played by white people in &#145;blackface&#146;. Indeed it was only in 1914 that the first recorded African-American actor played a major role in a commercial American film (Sam Lucas as Uncle Tom in <span class="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</span>). In 1919 Trimmingham made his most interesting film appearance, as the cowboy Pete in <span class="italic">Jack, Sam, and Pete</span>. The influence of Hollywood was very much in evidence in this adventure film, one of the few westerns made in Britain. His last known film appearance was in <span class="italic">Where the Rainbow Ends</span> (1921), a fantasy based on a popular Christmas children's play in which a group of children find a magic carpet and save their shipwrecked parents from a dragon. Trimmingham was cast as the Genie.<br>
<br>On stage Trimmingham was frequently in demand to portray black characters (though these were rarely major parts). His West End appearances included <span class="italic">Welcome Stranger</span> (Lyric Theatre, 1921), <span class="italic">In Walked Jimmy</span> (Q Theatre, Kew, 1925), <span class="italic">Might-Have-Been</span> (Prince's Theatre, 1927), <span class="italic">Magnolia Street</span> (Adelphi, 1934), <span class="italic">Sweet Aloes</span> (Wyndham's, 1934), <span class="italic">The Miracle Man</span> (Victoria Palace, 1935), and <span class="italic">No Sleep for the Wicked</span> (Daly's, 1937). His last recorded appearance was in <span class="italic">Room V</span> at the Garrick Theatre in 1941. He died on 2 February 1942, at 216 Clapham Road, Stockwell, London, and was buried in the variety artistes' section of Streatham Park cemetery.<br>
