<span class="headword">Martin,  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1763&#150;1818), <span class="occ">mineral surveyor and civil engineer</span>, was born at Matterdale, Cumberland, the youngest of the eight children of Joseph Martin (1712&#150;1790) and his wife, Susanna Rumney (1717&#150;1810). Nothing else is known of Martin's life until 1781, when John Bateman (1749&#150;1816), the chief colliery engineer of Sir James Lowther (1736&#150;1802) at Whitehaven, Cumberland, reported that Martin was then viewer at the nearby Whingill colliery. It seems likely that this was his earliest post; the geologist John Farey (1766&#150;1826) later wrote that Martin &#145;was brought up and taught his art as a Coal-engineer in the coal district near Whitehaven&#146;  (Farey 1813, 172).<br>
<br>By 1787 Martin was in south Wales acting as agent to John Smith (<i>d</i>. 1797) at Gwern-llwyn-chwyth, Llansamlet. On 23 January 1788, at Llansamlet, he married Martha (1763&#150;1844), daughter of the Swansea timber merchant Thomas Lott (<i>c</i>.1735&#150;1808). In the mid-1790s they settled at Morriston, Glamorgan; they had at least four sons and two daughters. (This may have been his second wife; there is a record of an Edward Martin's marrying at Distington, Cumberland, in 1785.)<br>
<br>Martin was busy as a civil engineer by the mid-1790s. He was elected harbour trustee in 1794 and was much involved with first attempts to develop the port of Swansea. In 1803&#150;4 he reported, with William Bevan, on how the harbour could be improved and river water there impounded for a floating harbour, and between 1805 and 1809 he was involved in improving the lighthouse on Mumbles Head. He was also active as a canal and tramroad engineer and surveyor. In 1790, by which time he was the principal Welsh colliery agent for the sixth duke of Beaufort, he had surveyed for the Swansea Canal&#151;ultimately becoming a shareholder. With the contemporary Welsh &#145;canal mania&#146; and enthusiasm for other improvements (as at Milford Haven by Charles Greville) Martin was in constant demand. Also in 1803&#150;4, he promoted an extension to the Swansea Canal via the Oystermouth tramroad, &#145;using Mr [Richard] Trevethick's very ingenious machine&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Cambrian</span>, 10 March 1804).<br>
<br>Martin's most significant work, however, was as mining consultant. In 1797 he opened collieries in the Twrch valley. In 1799 he reported to the first marquess of Bute's agent, John Bird (1761&#150;1840), that &#145;there would be Coal and Ore enough on Caerphilly Common [alone] to employ an Iron Furnace for one hundred years&#146;  (H. M. Thomas, <span class="italic">The Diaries of John Bird of Cardiff</span>, 1987, 117). In 1801 Martin reported (for Capel Hanbury-Leigh) on improving the Gnoll collieries in the Vale of Neath; in 1803 he reported on the nearby Maesmarchog stone coal (anthracite) colliery. In June 1804 he was consulted on how coal supplies for the revitalized Pontypool ironworks might be improved.<br>
<br>From 1804 Martin was involved as colliery-letting agent throughout south Wales. In June of that year, he took out his only patent&#151;for making pig and cast iron from local ironstone with steam coal. It showed how aware he was of the mineral potential of the region. In 1806 he was involved in sinking a pit at Bryn-coch, the first deep pit in Wales, to about 600 feet depth. By 1809 he was operating his own coalmining partnership, the Penyvilia Vein Company at Llangyfelach, having inherited collieries on his father-in-law's death in 1808.<br>
<br>Martin's mineral surveying work culminated in his &#145;Description of the mineral bason in the counties of Monmouth, Glamorgan, Brecon, Carmarthen and Pembrokeshire&#146;, read to the Royal Society by Charles Greville on 22 May 1806. It described the distribution of the principal varieties of coal and iron strata and their lateral variation, with a sketch map showing their extent. It was widely reprinted, appearing in (for example) <span class="italic">The Cambrian</span>, on 20 July 1807, and Nicholson's <span class="italic">Journal of Natural Philosophy</span> for 1807&#150;8. The paper also took Martin to London in April 1806, where he exchanged much geological data with John Farey (1766&#150;1826).<br>
<br>Martin was working in the Llanelli coalfield from July 1806: his report contains the earliest known plan of the Llanelli syncline&#151;he was aware of the nature of faulting in this region, a matter misunderstood by others at that time. In 1807 he took into partnership his future son-in-law, David Davies (1786&#150;1819) of Morriston. Together they surveyed for the Pen-clawdd Canal in 1810&#150;11 and were busy with the Kidwelly and Llanelli Canal in 1811&#150;12. In 1811 Martin, with William Smith (1769&#150;1839), reported on the state of the collieries at and near Nailsea for the Bristol and Taunton Canal, a work reprinted in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, as by &#145;two eminent mineral surveyors&#146;  (38, 1811, 321).<br>
<br>On Martin's death on 6 May 1818 at Ynystawe, whence he had moved from Morriston, the local newspaper called him &#145;a man of sterling integrity and worth, eminent for his extensive knowledge of collieries&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cambrian</span>, 16 May 1818). Charles Wilkins later confirmed that Martin's &#145;extensive local and general mining knowledge made him indispensable in the early days of the Neath and Swansea collieries&#146;  (Wilkins, 240). Martin was buried at St John's Church, Swansea, on 16 May 1818.<br>
