<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Madan,  Falconer</span>  (1851&#150;1935), <span class="occ">librarian and bibliographer</span>, was born on 15 April 1851 at Cam vicarage, Gloucestershire, the fifth and youngest son of George Madan (1807&#150;1891), vicar of Cam, and his wife, Harriet (1813&#150;1904), daughter of William Gresley. He was educated at Crewkerne grammar school (1861&#150;4) and Marlborough College (1864&#150;70), and won a scholarship to Brasenose College, Oxford in 1870. There he gained first-class honours in honour moderations, and second-class honours in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1874. He was elected a fellow of Brasenose in 1876, and entered the Bodleian Library as a sub-librarian in June 1880. His college fellowship lapsed at this point, but was renewed in 1889 (when he was also appointed, until 1913, university lecturer in palaeography), and he was made an honorary fellow in 1912. On 29 December 1885 he married Frances Jane (<i>b</i>. 1861) daughter of Harrison Hayter. They had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Madan's grasp of minute scholarly detail, already demonstrated in collections for the revision of Liddell and Scott's <span class="italic">Greek-English Lexicon</span>, found immediate expression at the Bodleian, where he was at first engaged in the cataloguing of accessions and arrears of manuscripts. His classical training also involved him in the cataloguing of printed books in Latin and Greek (including early books). An awakened interest in printing and the book trade in Oxford rapidly assumed importance in his library work, and he was thus able both to fill gaps in the Bodleian's holdings and to amass a major collection of his own.<br>
<br>Bodleian manuscript holdings had hitherto been published (in Latin and in great detail) in a series of volumes known as <span class="roman">Quarto Catalogues</span>. In 1890 the curators agreed, upon the suggestion of Andrew Clark, a junior proctor and fellow of Lincoln College, who was advised by Madan, that both existing collections and future accessions should be recorded in a briefer form and with an English apparatus. Madan was the principal architect of the <span class="italic">Summary Catalogue</span>, and worked on it until 1912; three volumes and part of a fourth appeared under his name, from 1895 to 1906, and his work was also acknowledged on the title-pages of subsequent volumes. The accuracy and content of his work are still seen as exemplary.<br>
<br>Madan's relations with E. W. B. Nicholson, Bodley's librarian from 1882, were at first friendly, but deteriorated to a point when librarian and sub-librarian only communicated in writing. Madan not only compiled a series of detailed notes in criticism of the librarian, but from time to time supplied this criticism to curators, to other members of the university, and, anonymously, to the press.<br>
<br>Upon Nicholson's enforced retirement in 1912, Madan succeeded him as librarian, at the age of sixty-one. On the outbreak of war in 1914, he was granted an extension for five years, and retired in 1919. As librarian, he continued his predecessor's policies, although bringing to the office greater caution and stability, a characteristically close attention to administrative detail, and the financial prudence which a time of war demanded. In particular, the library's financial deficit was eliminated. The <span class="italic">Bodleian Library Quarterly</span> was established by Madan in 1914. He was president of the Library Association from 1914 to 1915.<br>
<br>Upon retirement, Madan devoted himself to his bibliographical interests. The nature of these necessitated a presence in the library as regular as that of a librarian in office, and it remained so, and was much valued by his former colleagues, until his death.<br>
<br>Although Madan was somewhat critical of the founding constitution of the Bibliographical Society, he became a member in 1892, and contributed substantially to its first <span class="italic">Transactions</span> (1893), with a discussion of bibliographical method, illustrated by a specimen of his forthcoming <span class="italic">Oxford Books</span>. One of the society's earliest preoccupations was with the establishment of a standard for bibliographical description, and Madan contributed forcefully to the debate, in which A. W. Pollard and W. W. Greg also participated. In 1909 he followed this by elaborating his &#145;degressive principle&#146;, by which different levels of detail in description were provided for books, according to their perceived importance. He was the society's president from 1919 to 1922.<br>
<br>It was in his work on the press in Oxford, together with his abilities as a manuscript cataloguer, that Madan's greatest achievement lay. The first volume of <span class="italic">Oxford Books</span> appeared in 1895, the second in 1912, and the third in 1931. The completion brought him the Bibliographical Society's gold medal in 1932. Madan was a founding member of the Oxford Bibliographical Society in 1921, and its president from 1924 to 1926. He died on 22 May 1935 at his home, 94 Banbury Road, Oxford, and was buried at Wolvercote. Even at the time of his death, he was seen as one of the last scholar-librarians; he was certainly the last to be equally at home in the worlds of both manuscripts and printed books.<br>
