<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Astley, Sir  John Dugdale</span>, third baronet  (1828&#150;1894), <span class="occ">sportsman</span>, a descendant of Thomas de Astley, who was slain at Evesham in 1265, and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/817/', "Jacob Astley, Lord Astley")</script>, was the eldest son of Sir Francis Dugdale Astley, second baronet (1805&#150;1873), of Everleigh, near Marlborough, and his wife, Emma Dorothea (<i>c</i>.1808&#150;1872), daughter of Sir Thomas Buckler Lethbridge. Born at Rome in a house on the Pincian Hill, on 19 February 1828, he was educated by private tutors and at Claverton Lodge, Bathwick, and Eton. He matriculated as a gentleman commoner at Christ Church, Oxford, on 4 June 1846. About a year later, by the pressing advice of the dean, Thomas Gaisford&#151;possibly connected with incidents such as blocking the route to chapel with a wall of snow and threatening to defenestrate the senior censor&#151;he went down from Oxford, heavily in debt. In September 1847 he was sent to study French at Clarens in Switzerland, where he amused himself by shooting gelinottes on the mountains.<br>
<br>In March 1848 Astley was gazetted ensign of the Scots guards, and his diary for the next few years is full of his diversions in the shape of racing, cricket, boxing, punting, and running (he himself was a first-rate sprinter at 150 yards). In February 1854 he sailed for the Crimea with his battalion, and he took an active part in the battle of the Alma, but was rather severely wounded in the neck, and invalided home. In April 1855 he again volunteered for active service, reached Balaklava in May, was made a brevet major, and was relegated for the greater part of the time to hospital duty in the town. At Balaklava he became celebrated as a promoter of sport throughout the three armies&#151;the French, British, and &#145;Sardines&#146;, as he designated the Italian troops. On his return he was promoted to a captaincy without examination, and subsequently became a lieutenant-colonel on the retired list. He obtained the Crimean medal with two clasps and the Turkish order of the Mejidiye.<br>
<br>On 22 May 1858 Astley married Eleanor Blanche Mary (<i>c</i>.1838&#150;1897), only child and heir of Thomas G. Corbet (<i>d</i>. 1868) of Elsham Hall, Brigg, a well-known Lincolnshire squire. His honeymoon was on the point of coming to a premature conclusion at Paris when he opportunely won &pound;1500 on the Liverpool cup. He quit the army the following year, and began to devote himself to racing, the sport which &#145;in his heart he always loved best&#146;. During the lifetime of his father-in-law, who had a horror of the turf, Astley raced under the borrowed name of Mr S. Thellusson and trained in Drewitt's stable at Lewes, where he learned by his own experience the difficult art of putting horses together, at which he obtained a proficiency rare among gentlemen. A real horse lover, and probably one of the finest judges of horse-flesh in Britain, he took an intense interest in everything connected with the stable, and knew his animals with &#145;the intimacy of a tout or a trainer&#146;. In 1869 he was chosen as a member of the Jockey Club. He was a steward from 1875 to 1878 and chairman of a committee revising the rules of racing. About the same time Drewitt retired from his profession, and Astley thenceforth had horses with Blanton, Joe Dawson, and other well-known trainers. He owned a number of good horses and won a great many stakes. With his usual candour he admits in his autobiography that he originally took to betting, as he subsequently took to authorship, for the purpose of &#145;diminishing the deficit&#146; at his bankers. In all, during twenty-six years, he won by betting &pound;28,968, but he did not put by his winnings, and at the end of that time was, he informs us with frank composure, &#145;dead broke&#146;.<br>
<br>While the turf remained his business amusement, Astley had still plenty of time to devote to other forms of sport. He describes the Sayers and Heenan prize fight of 17 April 1860 with the gusto of a connoisseur, and he moralizes in an impressive way upon the degeneracy of later boxers, whose exhibitions he nevertheless continued to patronize until the end of his life. In 1875 he made the acquaintance of Captain Webb, the channel swimmer, and arranged several tournaments for his benefit. In April 1877 he matched E. P. Weston, the celebrated American pedestrian, against Dan O'Leary in a walking match of 142 hours for &pound;500 a side. O'Leary won, as he admiringly records, by sheer pluck, covering 520 miles in the allotted time, and beating Weston by 10 miles. Astley arranged a number of similar contests, and was barely recouped by the gate money. He also speculated unsuccessfully in luxury clubs.<br>
<br>Astley succeeded to the baronetcy on 23 July 1873; he became a JP for Lincolnshire and Wiltshire, and in 1874 he was elected to parliament as Conservative member for North Lincolnshire. While an MP he promoted the <span class="roman">Horse-poisoning Act</span> (1876), but he lost his seat in the general election of 1880. He died at home at 7 Park Place, St James's Street, London, on 10 October 1894, and was buried on 16 October at Elsham. His death evoked expressions of regret from the whole sporting community in England, among whom he was known by the nickname of The Mate. He left eight children&#151;Sir Francis Edmund George Astley-Corbet, the fourth baronet (1859&#150;1937), three other sons, and four daughters.<br>
<br>Astley published a few months before his death <span class="italic">Fifty Years of my Life in the World of Sport at Home and Abroad</span> (2 vols., 1894), dedicated by permission to the prince of Wales (later Edward VII). Written in a breezy style and abounding in slang, these memories disarm the critic by their frankness no less than by the complete <i>sans-g&ecirc;ne</i> of the narrator, whose gambling propensity appears throughout as indomitable as his pluck. The book went rapidly through three editions, and was described by the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> as &#145;<i>the</i> sporting memoir of the century&#146;.<br>
