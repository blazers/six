<span class="headword">Grimshaw,  (John) Atkinson</span>  (1836&#150;1893), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born on 6 September 1836 at 9 Back Park Street, Leeds, the third son of six children of David Grimshaw (<i>b</i>. 1811), a policeman, and his wife, Mary Atkinson. In 1842 the family moved to Norwich, where Grimshaw briefly attended the grammar school. In 1848 the Grimshaws moved back to Leeds, where David Grimshaw obtained a job on the railways; the family also kept a grocer's shop in Brunswick Row. By 1852 Grimshaw had obtained a position as a clerk with the Great Northern Railway Company. He had begun to paint by the late 1850s and does not seem to have received any formal training as an artist. Family tradition relates that his mother disapproved of this activity, threw his paints on the fire, and even turned off the gas in his room.<br>
<br>On 24 October 1856 Grimshaw married his cousin, Frances Theodosia (1835&#150;1917), daughter of James Dibdin Hubbard, editor of the <span class="italic">Wakefield Journal</span>. The couple first lived in Wallace Street, New Wortley, Leeds. In 1861 Grimshaw gave up his railway job to paint full time. His early paintings were small in scale and consisted of still-life studies of birds' nests, fruit and flowers, and woodland scenes. His few attempts at figure painting were extremely tentative and hesitant. In emulation of Millais, Grimshaw signed his earliest pictures with a Gothic-style monogram <i>JAG</i>, then changed to using <i>J. A. Grimshaw</i> and then <i>John Atkinson Grimshaw</i>. By the late 1860s, however, he had decided on the form <i>Atkinson Grimshaw</i> as his preferred name which was how he was usually known.<br>
<br>Grimshaw's early paintings were influenced by the work of the Pre-Raphaelites. The Leeds stockbroker Thomas Plint owned a significant collection of modern paintings, including works by Millais, Holman Hunt, and D. G. Rossetti. Plint lent some of these works to the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society, of which Grimshaw's father was a member. Another important influence was the Leeds-based painter of Pre-Raphaelite landscapes John William Inchbold (1830&#150;1888), a friend of John Ruskin. Grimshaw was attracted to Ruskin's rallying call from <span class="italic">Modern Painters</span> to &#145;go to nature in all singleness of heart&#146;  (Ruskin, 416), and for a brief period in the mid-1860s Grimshaw painted in minute detail in vivid colours on a white ground, emulating Inchbold and other Pre-Raphaelite artists. These were mainly views of the Lake District, for example <span class="italic">The Bowder Stone</span> (Tate Collection), which followed a visit to the area in 1863. He also used photographs as an <i>aide-m&eacute;moire</i> for these lakeland views, and throughout his life may have relied on photography as a basis for some of his paintings. However, by the late 1860s Grimshaw had turned to the depiction of moonlight, which was to become his trademark.<br>
<br>In 1870, after moving around Leeds, the Grimshaw family settled at Old Hall, Knostrop (dem. 1960), a seventeenth-century stone-built manor house 2 miles east of Leeds town centre. The setting would have had tremendous appeal to Grimshaw, whose Romanticism manifested itself in the titles of his paintings, often related to the works of Romantic poets, including Keats and Longfellow, and also in the names of his children. Old Hall remained the Grimshaw family's main home for the next twenty-three years; of the couple's fifteen children only six survived to adulthood.<br>
<br>The 1870s were Grimshaw's most successful decade artistically and financially. He was represented by Thomas Agnew &amp; Sons of Bond Street, London, who bought his paintings between 1871 and 1880 and showed his work at their London and provincial galleries. During this time the main elements of Grimshaw's most frequent subject matter and customary style emerged: damp, autumnal lanes featuring a lonely house and single figure, often illuminated by moonlight, seen through a trellis of bare branches. In 1874 the Royal Academy accepted <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lea</span>, a painting in this mode, for its annual exhibition. Grimshaw was to show there again in 1880, 1885, and 1886. Scenes of Liverpool, Hull, and Glasgow docks were another important subject, providing the artist with an endlessly varied compositional motif. Typically these works utilized a formula of converging buildings and dock-side shipping, a wet road reflecting passers-by and the lights from the shop windows, for example <span class="italic">The Old Custom House, Liverpool, Looking North</span> (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool).<br>
<br>For a period from the mid-1870s until 1886 Grimshaw was also attracted to the style and technique of Lawrence Alma-Tadema and J. J. Tissot, producing similar pictures of fashionable ladies in settings from ancient Rome and in domestic interiors replete with a wealth of detail, for example <span class="italic">Fiametta</span> (Cartwright Hall, Bradford) and <span class="italic">Summer</span> (priv. coll.). In 1885, Grimshaw also exhibited at the recently established Grosvenor Gallery, London, a painting entitled <span class="italic">A Vestal</span> (priv. coll.). Recognition encouraged the artist to rent a second home in Scarborough on the Yorkshire coast, overlooking North Bay. The town was to become Grimshaw's favourite subject, for example <span class="italic">Lights in the Harbour</span> (Crescent Art Gallery, Scarborough), and he painted its streets and bay more often than any other locality.<br>
<br>In the midst of this prosperity came disaster when Grimshaw was forced to guarantee a bill for a friend who defaulted. The details are unclear but family history dates the years of struggle and &#145;mass production&#146; of paintings from about the beginning of the 1880s. The bill was probably taken over by the Harrogate solicitor Walter Battle, whose art collection included many Grimshaws. These may have been acquired as part payment of the debt. It must be supposed that the greatly increased output of paintings from the early 1880s was in response to the financial crisis.<br>
<br>Grimshaw also painted a series of great views of London and the Thames, for example <span class="italic">Reflections on the Thames, Westminster</span> (Leeds City Art Gallery). Such paintings are majestic in concept and realization; most have a blaze of light on the river and an all-enveloping film of colour. When Grimshaw needed to show human activity, figures were taken from engravings after Frank Holl and Gustave Dor&eacute;. Family tradition also relates an artistic connection between Grimshaw and Whistler, who became acquainted when Grimshaw took a studio in Manresa Road, Chelsea, about 1885. Whistler supposedly remarked that he thought he had invented the nocturne until he saw Grimshaw's moonlights.<br>
<br>In the last years of his life Grimshaw moved towards a simpler tonal arrangement in a series of river estuary paintings and two beach scenes, as well as some snow scenes painted in the last winter of his life, such as <span class="italic">Snow and Mist: Caprice in Yellow Minor</span> (Leeds City Art Gallery). Grimshaw's paintings of Victorian streets and river life resonated with the influence of the poets Grimshaw loved: Keats, Tennyson, Longfellow. He died on 31 October 1893 at Old Hall, Knostrop, Leeds, and was buried on 4 November at Woodhouse cemetery, Leeds.<br>
