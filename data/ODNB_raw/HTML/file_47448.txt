<span class="headword">Warburg,  Fredric John</span>  (1898&#150;1981), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born at 117 Gloucester Terrace, Paddington, London, on 27 November 1898, the only son of the three children of Jewish parents, John Cimon Warburg (1867&#150;1931), amateur photographer, and his wife, Violet Amalia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sichel (1868&#150;1925), who was born in South Yarra, Melbourne, Victoria. Educated first at home by Miss Coolie, a governess, Fredric John was sent at the age of nine to Wilkinson's preparatory school for boys, St Petersburg Place, Bayswater. At thirteen he won a scholarship to Westminster School. While he excelled academically, he described his years there, particularly the first two, as &#145;among the most hateful &hellip; of my life&#146;  (Warburg, <span class="italic">Occupation</span>, 30). As a Jew he felt an outsider and he often took refuge in books.<br>
<br>In July 1917 Warburg enlisted in the Royal Garrison Artillery and received his commission as second lieutenant in October. Just after his nineteenth birthday he was posted to the 184th siege battery and sent to France, where he served in the Ypres salient until the end of the war. After being demobilized in 1919 he took up his exhibition at Christ Church, Oxford, where he initially read chemistry. Believing that &#145;words for me &hellip; were the stuff out of which I had to manufacture the fabric of my life&#146;, he switched to <i>literae humaniores</i> in spring 1920  (Warburg, <span class="italic">Occupation</span>, 70). He took a second and proceeded MA in 1922. That year, with the recommendation of his brother-in-law, he became an apprentice at the publishing firm of George Routledge &amp; Sons Ltd under the tutelage of the head of Routledge, William Swan Stallybrass, whom Warburg referred to as &#145;my Master&#146; and the &#145;greatest scholar&#150;publisher of his day&#146;  (ibid., 121). Warburg &#145;became a publisher by osmotic absorption, sucking in the wisdom of my elders through the sceptical filter of a mind trained in the metaphysical hair-splitting of an Oxford course in Greats&#146;  (ibid., 89).<br>
<br>On 5 July 1922 Warburg married May Nellie Holt (1902&#150;1997), daughter of Hellier Holt. They had three sons but were divorced in 1932. On 21 January 1933 he married the painter and designer Pamela Bryer, <i>n&eacute;e</i> de Bayou (1905&#150;1978), a widow with whom he had a son who died of a cerebral haemorrhage only twenty-four hours after his birth. After Stallybrass's death in 1931 Warburg became increasingly dissatisfied with his job at Routledge. He attempted innovations, but in 1935 he was dismissed from the company. That year he and Roger Senhouse purchased the publishing firm of Martin Secker, which was in receivership, for &pound;3100. With Senhouse looking after the finances and Warburg concerned with &#145;practically everything else&#146;  (Warburg, <span class="italic">Occupation</span>, 175), Secker and Warburg, as it was renamed, published the works of Thomas Mann, H. G. Wells, Andr&eacute; Gide, Louis Mumford, and George Orwell. The firm quickly became known for its radical stance, but while it was anti-fascist, it was also anti-communist and thus in direct opposition to the ethos of many intellectuals of the day, especially those published by Victor Gollancz. When Orwell and Gollancz parted company over <span class="italic">The Road to Wigan Pier</span>&#151;Gollancz was unhappy with Orwell's equivocal socialist beliefs&#151;it was to Warburg that Orwell took <span class="italic">Homage to Catalonia</span>. Thereafter the firm published all of Orwell's work, and the author and the publisher became trusted friends. During the Second World War, Warburg served as a corporal in the St John's Wood company Home Guard; his sergeant was Blair (Orwell).<br>
<br>In 1951, with its fortunes in difficulty, Secker and Warburg joined the Heinemann Group of publishers. In 1952 Warburg helped to found the magazine <span class="italic">Encounter</span> and persuaded Stephen Spender to be its British editor. Intended as an English version of the French <span class="italic">Preuves</span>, a cultural magazine arising out of the Society for Cultural Freedom (of which Warburg was treasurer), <span class="italic">Encounter</span> was first published in October 1953. It later came under fire from Spender and others when it was made public that much of the money to produce the magazine came from the CIA. Warburg defended this by saying that &#145;in the early fifties the C.I.A. was not by any means the hated organization it is today. Then the Russians appeared hostile &hellip; while the Bay of Pigs and the brutalities of the Vietnam involvement lay in the future&#146;  (Warburg, <span class="italic">Occupation</span>, 156).<br>
<br>Warburg's ability to stand up to the establishment was tested in 1954 when he faced prosecution for publishing a supposedly obscene book, <span class="italic">The Philanderer</span> by Stanley Kauffmann. He related his version of events in &#145;A slight case of obscenity&#146;, in the <span class="italic">New Yorker Magazine</span> in April 1957. Although he was offered the chance to plead guilty and therefore incur a relatively modest fine with the injunction to destroy all copies of the book, Warburg opted for a much riskier&#151;and more public&#151;trial at the Old Bailey. The gamble paid off, and he was acquitted by a unanimous jury of all charges. The presiding justice's summing up became &#145;famous throughout legal and literary circles&#146;  (Warburg, <span class="italic">All Authors are Equal</span>, 188) for its common-sense approach to a difficult subject. It was printed as an appendix in later editions of <span class="italic">The Philanderer</span>. The case opened the way for the changes to the <span class="roman">Obscene Publications Act</span>, long before the famous <span class="italic">Lady Chatterley</span> trial in 1960.<br>
<br>During the 1950s Secker and Warbug published the works of Simone de Beauvoir, Colette, Alberto Moravia, G&uuml;nter Grass, and Angus Wilson, as well as the translation of Pierre Boulle's <span class="italic">La pont de la rivi&egrave;re Kwai</span>. William Shirer's <span class="italic">The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</span> (1960) marked the firm's entry into the new decade, which saw the publication of the novels of Melvyn Bragg and Julian Gloag. In 1961 Warburg was appointed a director of the Heinemann Group, a post he held until his retirement in 1971.<br>
<br>Warburg published two volumes of autobiography: <span class="italic">An Occupation for Gentlemen</span> (1959) and <span class="italic">All Authors are Equal</span> (1973). His wife, Pamela, was a sustaining force in his life until her death in 1978. Fredric Warburg died of heart failure at University College Hospital, London, on 25 May 1981.<br>
