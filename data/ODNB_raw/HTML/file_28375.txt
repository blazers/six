<span class="headword">Waddington,  Samuel Ferrand</span>  (<em>b. </em>1759, <em>d.</em> in or after 1824), <span class="occ">radical</span>, was born at Walkeringham, Nottinghamshire, on 18 May 1759, the son of Joshua Waddington (1709/10&#150;1781), vicar of Walkeringham, and his wife, Ann, daughter of Thomas Ferrand, vicar of Bingley. He was educated at a German university and trained for a life in commerce. He engaged in the hop trade, and resided near Tonbridge, Kent. He married, at Margate on 20 April 1788, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jarvis, with whom he had at least eight children.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the French Revolution Waddington strongly espoused the cause of the republicans, and in 1795 was chairman of several meetings in London held for the purpose of petitioning the crown and parliament to make peace with France. In consequence of his views he was expelled from the Surrey troop of light horse. In 1796 he attacked Edmund Burke in a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Remarks on Mr Burke's two letters &#145;on the proposals for peace with the regicide Directory of France&#146;</span>, censuring him for applying the term &#145;regicide&#146; to the Directory. In 1800 he was brought to trial for forestalling hops, having entered into contracts with hop growers in Kent and Worcestershire to buy up large quantities of their produce, with a view to creating a scarcity. Waddington believed that he had committed no crime, as the statutes against forestalling, regrating, and engrossing had been repealed in 1772. Proceedings against him were heard in the court of king's bench, where the lord chief justice, Lord Kenyon, in particular, reaffirmed the criminality of such activities. Kenyon and others of the judges regarded Waddington as a dangerous radical who was likely to welcome the popular discontent aroused by shortages of basic commodities. Early in 1801 he was sentenced to one month's imprisonment and a fine of &pound;500 for the Worcestershire offence, followed by another period of three months in prison and a fine of &pound;500 for his trading in Kent. In all he spent twenty-seven weeks in the king's bench gaol. He wrote a number of pamphlets during his trial, attacking the court and depicting the hop merchants and brewers bringing the prosecution as themselves monopolists, who exploited the hop growers. The growers celebrated his eventual release from imprisonment. He seems to have been financially ruined by the legal cost of his trials, and between 1811 and 1814 petitioned the prince of Wales and members of the government, seeking employment in the customs service to alleviate his plight  (Hay, 150n). Labelled by satirists as Little Waddington on account of his being only 4 feet 2 inches tall, he lived in Southwark and in Kent until 1812, when he published <span class="italic">An Address to the People of the United Kingdom</span>, which he had written under the pseudonym Algernon Sydney. He was a member of the Union for Parliamentary Reform, set up in the same year, the later Committee of Two Hundred, and stood trial in 1820 for his support of the soldiers who mutinied during the Queen Caroline affair. He was tried in 1822 for publishing blasphemous literature from a shop in the Strand, London. By early 1824 he was reportedly employed as the manager of a gang of placard bearers advertising the wares of a City of London coal merchant. Details of Waddington's death are unknown.<br>
