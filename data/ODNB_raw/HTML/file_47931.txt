<span class="headword">Dent,  Frederick James</span>  (1905&#150;1973), <span class="occ">research chemist</span>, was born on 12 October 1905 at Horbury in Yorkshire, the son of Frederick Dent and his wife, Sarah Liddle Pearson. His father had been a talented and inventive professional photographer who, after his business failed, became an engineer supervising the installation of telephone exchanges; later he was an engineering inspector in the civil service based in Leeds. Dent's mother came from a seafaring family; she won a scholarship and became a teacher.<br>
<br>Dent had an outstanding school career at the Leeds Boys' Modern School, where he became head boy. He had intended to follow an artistic career, but towards the end of his time at school he was persuaded to turn towards science with such good effect that he was awarded two scholarships, enabling him to enter the department of fuel at Leeds University. In 1927 he obtained first-class honours, the LeBlanc medal, and a postgraduate scholarship. As there had been close links between the university and the gas industry since the early years of the century, it was natural that Dent should undertake research on carbonization for his PhD, which was awarded in 1929.<br>
<br>Following this, Dent was appointed research chemist by the joint research board of Leeds University and the Institution of Gas Engineers. He spent several years investigating the cyclical water&#150;gas process of making gas from coke. Hearing in 1935 of the new German Lurgi process for gasification of lignite, Dent turned his attention to the direct gasification of coal under high pressure. This work progressed well but was interrupted by the war and he had to turn his attention to the synthesis of methane. On 1 January 1942 he married Jean Marie Macvean, and they had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Dent's prospects were transformed by the nationalization of the gas industry in 1949. He was appointed head of one of the industry's research stations, with both staff and resources, and was responsible for work on high-pressure gasification. This was the start of an extremely fruitful period of research under his inspiration, at first into coal gasification and later, when oil supplies became widely available, into the direct conversion of oil into gas. Processes developed under his leadership include the catalytic rich gas (CRG) process, using naphtha, and the gas recycle hydrogenator (GRH), which could use other oil fractions. These processes were flexible and cheap and could produce either a coal-gas equivalent or a substitute natural gas (SNG). They were therefore of great interest wherever gas was supplied. At the time of his death, Dent's CRG process was being used widely in the USA, Japan, and South America, as well as in the UK, incidentally earning substantial royalties for the British gas industry. Dent and his team, to whom he gave generous credit, were responsible for numerous scientific papers and patent specifications for gas-making processes.<br>
<br>Dent was notable for his ability not only to visualize chemical processes but also to design the hardware to transform them into process technology on an industrial scale. He was a prodigious worker and hard taskmaster who nevertheless managed to endue his colleagues with his own unbounded enthusiasm for the tasks in hand. Despite having spent much of his life working on coal, in his fifties he had the vision to be able to turn with equal success to oil gasification, producing results that were of even greater significance to the industry. By nature a hands-on researcher, he was less at home with the routines of managing a large research establishment. He was appointed OBE in 1958 and was elected FRS in 1967, the year of his retirement.<br>
<br>Dent's enthusiastic nature was manifested not only in his work but also in the leisure activities into which he threw himself. He was an accomplished photographer, and gained an abiding love of the sea after he was introduced to sailing by a colleague at Poole during the war. Family holidays were spent in his <i>Blue Jay</i>, a cutter built in 1926, exploring the south coast and, later, Normandy and Brittany. After his retirement he severed all connections with the gas industry. He left Britain and sailed past Gibraltar into the Mediterranean, to Malta, where he set up home, and to the Greek islands. He returned only briefly in 1971 to receive the prestigious MacRobert award from Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace. He died on 5 October 1973 at his home, 13 Valley View Court, Zaccheus Street, Maida, Malta, shortly after being taken ill while cruising round Greece. His wife survived him.<br>
