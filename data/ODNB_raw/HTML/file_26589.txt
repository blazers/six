<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Storace,  Ann Selina <span class="st"> [Nancy]</span></span>  (1765&#150;1817), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 27 October 1765 in London, the second and last child of Stefano (Anglicized to Stephen) Storace (<i>d</i>. 1783?) and his wife, Elizabeth (1739?&#150;1821), the daughter of John Trusler of Bath and London. Her father was an Italian musician from a village near Naples, who had emigrated to England by 1747, and who worked in Bristol and Dublin before settling in London. There he played the double bass for the Italian Opera at the King's Theatre. For several seasons he also worked at John Trusler's Marylebone Pleasure Gardens during the summers, where he met his wife. Nancy Storace (as Ann was commonly called, though she signed herself Anna) had one brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26590/', "Stephen Storace")</script>, a composer. Their name was often spelt Storache, for the sake of indicating its pronunciation.<br>
<br>Instructed in music by her father, Nancy quickly proved a gifted singer, and made her first public appearance in Southampton in 1773. She became a pupil of Antonio Sacchini and Venanzio Rauzzini. In 1777 she sang in Hereford and Brighton, and in London at Covent Garden, and had a benefit concert at the Ancient Music Concert Room in Tottenham Street (later the Scala Theatre) on 27 April 1778. This financed a trip for herself and her parents to Naples, where Stephen was studying. According to the singer Michael Kelly (1764&#150;1826), who became a family friend, she sang in oratorios given during Lent at the San Carlo Theatre. The family then went to Florence, where she and her brother performed at the opera, she singing, he at the harpsichord. Kelly describes the circumstances (probably apocryphal) that brought her fame:<blockquote>Bianchi had composed the celebrated cavatina, &#145;Sembianza amabile del mio bel sole&#146;, which Marchesi [a famous castrato] sung with most ravishing taste; in one passage he ran up a voletta of semitone octaves, the last note of which he gave with such exquisite power and strength, that it was ever after called &#145;La bomba di Marchesi&#146;! Immediately after this song, Storace had to sing one. &hellip; She attempted [a bomba of her own], and executed it, to the admiration and astonishment of the audience, but to the dismay of poor Marchesi. (Kelly, 1.97)</blockquote>When Marchesi issued an ultimatum, Campigli, the manager, had to dismiss his soprano. After staying in Florence from 1779 to 1781, she went on to sing in Lucca, Leghorn (where she first met Kelly), Parma, Milan (La Scala, 1782), and Venice. About 1783 her father died. She and Kelly were engaged as members of Emperor Joseph II's new <i>opera buffa</i> company in Vienna. In her four years as <i>prima buffa</i> she sang roles created for her by Salieri, Paisiello, Martin y Soler, and her brother, and was the original Susanna in Mozart's <span class="italic">Le nozze di Figaro</span>. Franz Kazinczy noted in his autobiography of her performance as Susanna: &#145;Storace, the beautiful singer, enchanted eye, ear and soul!&#146;  (quoted in O. E. Deutsch, <span class="italic">Mozart: a Documentary Biography</span>, 1965, 276). Mozart became a friend and wrote several works for her. She contracted a brief and disastrous marriage with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9501/', "John Abraham Fisher (1744&#150;1806)")</script>, from whom, after undergoing brutal treatment, she separated in 1784. The emperor ordered Fisher to leave Vienna.<br>
<br>After returning to London in 1787, Nancy and Stephen joined the Italian opera company at the King's Theatre, making their d&eacute;buts on 24 March, she as Gelinda in Paisiello's <span class="italic">Gli schiavi per amore</span>, he as musical director. She sang at the King's Theatre for more than two years, but followed Stephen to Drury Lane after the King's Theatre burnt down in the summer of 1789. She first appeared at Drury Lane on 24 November 1789, playing Adela in <span class="italic">The Haunted Tower</span>, an English opera by Stephen. For the next six years Nancy was the principal comic singer at Drury Lane. Her brother wrote leading roles for her, including Lilla in <span class="italic">The Siege of Belgrade</span> (1791), Fabulina in <span class="italic">The Pirates</span> (1792), and Elinor in <span class="italic">The Cherokee</span> (1794), and parts in several shorter works, notably Margaretta in the popular <span class="italic">No Song, No Supper</span> (1790). She was the highest-paid singer at Drury Lane, averaging 10 guineas a performance. She sang at several of the annual Handel festivals in Westminster Abbey, and also performed in festivals in Salisbury, Oxford, and Hereford.<br>
<br>After Stephen Storace died in March 1796, Nancy and Michael Kelly completed his last opera, <span class="italic">Mahmoud</span>, which was staged several times, including at a benefit performance on 25 May 1796, whose receipts were given to Stephen's widow, Mary, and their son. At Drury Lane (or possibly at Bath) the same year Nancy Storace met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3224/', "John Braham (1777?&#150;1856)")</script>, with whom she sang. They lived as man and wife for almost twenty years, and in 1802 had a son, Spencer. In 1797 Storace and Braham went to Paris, where they gave a series of concerts, and remained there for eight months. They arrived in Italy in 1798 and sang in two operas in Florence before going to Milan and Genoa. Avoiding war-torn Naples, they travelled to Leghorn and Venice, then by Trieste, Vienna, and Hamburg, home to England, where they arrived in the winter of 1801. They both then joined the Covent Garden company, and performed there together until 1805, when they returned to Drury Lane. Nancy remained there until her retirement, singing leading roles in operas by many of the composers and arrangers then active, including Braham and Kelly, and in occasional revivals of works by Stephen Storace and others. She continued to perform in provincial festivals, notably at Salisbury and Oxford.<br>
<br>On 30 May 1808 Storace took a benefit at which she delivered a &#145;Farewell Address in Music&#146; to words by George Colman, and appeared as Floretta in <span class="italic">The Cabinet</span>. She then retired to Herne Hill Cottage, near Dulwich, her country home since 1805. She and Braham separated acrimoniously in 1816. Storace died on 24 August 1817 and was buried at St Mary's, Lambeth, on 2 September. In her will, dated 10 August 1797, twenty years earlier, she left legacies amounting to about &pound;11,000, including &pound;1000 each to the Old Musical Fund and the New Musical Fund. Several of the personal bequests were out of date by 1817. Her son, Spencer, who was not born when she made her will, was not mentioned, but his father, from whom she was estranged at her death, received &pound;2000. Braham later transferred the money to his son. Other beneficiaries, including her nephew Brinsley and his mother, Mary, had predeceased her. Her estate was probated at under &pound;50,000.<br>
<br>Storace's voice was sometimes described as harsh, and suited better to big spaces than small. A vivacious stage personality compensated for her lack of physical beauty (she was short and plump). At her best she was a polished singer and an admirable comic actress.<br>
