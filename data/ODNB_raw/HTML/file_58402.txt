<span class="headword">William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>William Clito]</span>  (1102&#150;1128), <span class="occ">prince</span>, was born on 25 October 1102, the only legitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23715/', "Robert, duke of Normandy (b. in or after 1050, d. 1134)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29448/', "William the Conqueror's")</script> eldest son, and Sibyl of Conversano (<i>d</i>. 1102/3), a lady of the Norman-Italian aristocracy whom Robert married while on his return journey from the first crusade, and who died shortly after bearing her child.<br>
<br>The word &#145;Clito&#146; signifies an heir to a kingdom or principality, and can be more briefly translated as &#145;prince&#146; (its Old English equivalent was &#145;&aelig;theling&#146;). Its application to William underlines the fact that, as the only son of the Conqueror's eldest son, his right to the Anglo-Norman succession posed a grave danger to the regime of his royal uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12948/', "Henry I")</script>. Indeed, according to the rule of primogeniture (which governed many but not all successions at this time), William's claim to the Anglo-Norman crown was better than Henry's own.<br>
<br>Henry I had ascended the English throne in 1100 when his elder brother, Robert Curthose, was returning to Normandy from the crusade. At the battle of Tinchebrai in 1106 Henry defeated and captured Robert, relegating him to what appears to have been a luxurious imprisonment for the remaining twenty-eight years of his life. King Henry and William Clito first met immediately after the battle, at the Norman stronghold of Falaise, when William was not yet four years old. Anxious to avoid any hint of wrongdoing toward the child, Henry placed him in the custody of Elias de St Sa&euml;ns, count of Arques (on the north-east frontier of Normandy), and the husband of one of Robert Curthose's natural daughters. This act of mercy cost Henry dearly in later years, for as William Clito grew toward maturity he became the focus for rebellions within Normandy and for hostility from outside.<br>
<br>In 1109 a conflict arose between Henry I and Louis VI of France over the issue of Henry's purported obligation to render homage to Louis for Normandy, and also to neutralize the great Norman frontier castle of Gisors. The conflict spread after Foulques (V), count of Anjou, acquired Maine in 1110, and refused to render the traditional homage to Henry for the province. Count Robert of Flanders joined the coalition but died shortly afterwards. Henry, aware of the potentially grave danger of William Clito's claim to rule Normandy, took steps to have him arrested (<i>c</i>.1110&#150;11), but William was spirited out of Normandy and, with his guardian Elias, wandered from court to court seeking support against his uncle. William received the backing of Louis VI, Foulques, and several Normans. But Henry I in the meantime outmanoeuvred Louis and Foulques militarily, and in 1113 concluded advantageous peace treaties with both men. Henry sealed his peace with Anjou by having Foulques's daughter Matilda betrothed to his sole legitimate son, William the &AElig;theling. William Clito, deprived of major supporters, retired to the court of Flanders where he was welcomed by its new count, the young Baudouin (VII). He is reported to have joined Baudouin's court as a boy of about ten, <i>c</i>.1113, and to have received knighthood from Baudouin at fourteen (1116).<br>
<br>Count Baudouin may have begun his series of attacks against Normandy on William Clito's behalf as early as 1114. By 1117 his raids against north-east Normandy enjoyed the support of several Norman magnates of the Pays de Caux and Talou, and also of Louis VI and Count Foulques, who had again broken with Henry I and once more supported William Clito. Between about mid-1118 and the summer of 1119 Henry I was engaged in full-scale warfare, the most widespread and dangerous of his reign, against King Louis, counts Foulques and Baudouin, and a growing number of Norman rebels, all of whom supported William's accession to the duchy of Normandy.<br>
<br>Flanders withdrew from the conflict when, in the autumn of 1118, Baudouin received a battle wound that proved to be mortal. In May or June 1119 Henry lured Foulques from the coalition supporting William Clito by arranging the marriage of Foulques's eldest daughter, Matilda, to Henry's son, William the &AElig;theling. William Clito's only major protector was now Louis VI who, on 20 August 1119, with William in his army, was severely defeated by Henry in the battle of Br&eacute;mule in the Norman Vexin. Louis and William both fled without their warhorses, and afterwards Henry I and William the &AElig;theling returned the horses to their two adversaries, fully equipped, as an act of chivalry and sweet condescension. At the papal council of Rheims in October 1119 Louis, with William Clito again at his side, appealed to Pope Calixtus II (who happened to be Louis's wife's uncle), but the result of Calixtus's intervention was a peace treaty between the two kings (<i>c</i>.1120) that was very much in Henry's favour. Meanwhile, with the collapse of the coalition and rebellion, William Clito had appealed directly to Henry in October 1119 near Aumale in north-western Normandy, urging the king to release Robert Curthose from confinement, and promising in return to accompany him to Jerusalem and never return. Henry, who had suffered perhaps a score of broken promises over the past two years on William Clito's behalf&#151;and several assassination attempts&#151;declined to release Robert. He did offer to welcome William to his court, grant him authority as earl over three English counties, and treat him as a son. William (now seventeen) declined the offer and resumed his exile.<br>
<br>The peace of 1120, which gave promise of good relations for the next generation between the previously warring parties, was destroyed by William the &AElig;theling's death in the sinking of the <i>White Ship</i> on 25 November 1120. William Clito's cause was thus revived, and in 1123 it acquired renewed force with his betrothal (later followed by marriage) to Foulques's daughter, Sibyl, the younger sister of William the Aethling's widow, Matilda of Anjou (who became a nun of Fontevrault). William's fortunes received further backing from a revolt in Normandy in 1123&#150;4, involving Amaury de Montfort, count of &Eacute;vreux, Waleran, count of Meulan (the lord of several important castles in the Risle valley), Hugues de Montfort-sur-Risle, and others. The rebellion collapsed, however, when an army consisting of the leading rebels was defeated, and most of them were taken prisoner, near Bourgtheroulde in spring 1124, by soldiers of Henry I's <i>familia</i>. Louis VI was kept out of Normandy when Henry I's son-in-law, Emperor Heinrich V, threatened a large-scale invasion of France. And, much to the fury of Foulques, Henry arranged through his ties with the papal court to have William's Angevin marriage annulled on the grounds of consanguinity, strictly interpreted.<br>
<br>Henry I, whose first wife, Matilda, had died in 1118, remarried in 1121 in the hope of producing another male heir, but his second marriage was barren. In autumn 1126 Henry passed over the candidacy of William Clito and persuaded his court to accept his daughter Matilda, now a childless widow, as successor to the throne. Louis VI, on news of this decision, again threw his full support behind William Clito. In January 1127 he arranged a marriage between William and the French queen's half-sister, Jeanne de Montferrat, and granted William the lordship of the French Vexin. Shortly afterwards William led an armed band to Henry's frontier castle of Gisors to issue a formal claim to Normandy. He was by now a chivalrous and attractive young man, and a number of Normans are said to have rendered him the respect due their natural lord.<br>
<br>On 2 March 1127 the situation changed dramatically when Count Charles of Flanders was murdered at mass. By 13 March Louis VI was in Arras to help punish the murderers and participate in the selection of the new count (Charles having been childless). On Louis's advice and command, the Flemings chose William Clito in preference to several other candidates (William's own claim derived from his grandmother, William the Conqueror's wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18335/', "Matilda of Flanders")</script>, who was the mother of both Robert Curthose and Henry I). As count of Flanders, the most urbanized principality in northern Europe, William now possessed the resources to advance his claims on Normandy more forcefully than ever before. Indeed, as the son of Robert Curthose, William constituted a threat to Henry's hold on England as well, as he showed in a charter for St Omer, dated 14 April 1127, in which he promised to confer privileges on the townsmen if ever he should rule over England.<br>
<br>When Henry heard the news of William's advancement at his Easter court at Woodstock, he was &#145;much distressed&#146;. Faced with the prospect of a renewal of the coalition that had nearly wrested Normandy from him nine years earlier, he devoted money, energy, and all his diplomatic ingenuity to forestalling the impending alliance and shaking the new count's hold on Flanders. To keep domestic peace (always his foremost priority) and to safeguard the integrity of his Anglo-Norman dominions, it was essential that Henry move swiftly to keep his enemies off balance. Thus he secretly sent money to various disappointed claimants to Flanders, putting himself nominally at their head, encouraging them all until he could discern which one might win sufficient support to unseat William. By 1128, as a result of Henry's machinations and William's inept handling of Flemish townspeople and their commercial interests, the county was in a state of general rebellion. Louis VI returned briefly in May to support William in his need, but suddenly withdrew in response to a military feint by Henry I, who sat with his army at the castle of &Eacute;pernon, between Paris and Chartres.<br>
<br>By this time Count Thierry of Alsace had emerged, with Henry's aid, as William Clito's chief rival to the Flemish countship. Hostilities continued in Flanders until late July 1128, when William, whose military fortunes seemed to be reviving, was mortally wounded in an assault on Thierry's castle of Aalst. His death brought the crisis, and Henry's troubles, to a sudden halt. It was an anticlimactic end to the career of one who, as child and man, had played a central role in Anglo-Norman affairs for over twenty years, without ever setting foot in Britain.<br>
