<span class="headword">Ornsby,  George</span>  (1809&#150;1886), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, born on 9 March 1809 at Darlington, co. Durham, was the eldest son of George Ornsby (1772&#150;1823), a solicitor, of The Lodge, Lanchester, and his wife, Margaret Askwith. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20844/', "Robert Ornsby (1820&#150;1889)")</script> was his younger brother. His father, an accomplished scholar, instructed his sons at home until his death in 1823; George was then sent to Durham grammar school (1823&#150;6). After practising as a solicitor in Durham, he entered University College, Durham, as a theological student in 1839. In 1841 he was ordained, and held in succession the curacies of Newburn, Northumberland (1841&#150;3); Sedgefield, co. Durham (1843&#150;4); and Whickham, in the same county (1845&#150;50). On 1 May 1843 he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1872), eldest daughter of John Wilson JP and deputy lieutenant, of The Hill, Brigham, Cumberland; they had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In July 1850, on the presentation of the dean and chapter of Durham, Ornsby was inducted to the vicarage of Fishlake, West Riding of Yorkshire; the charge of this small parish left him ample opportunity for literary pursuits. In 1872 the University of Durham conferred on him the honorary degree of MA, and on 29 May 1873 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In 1879 he was preferred to the prebendal stall of Ampleforth at York. He was also a JP and deputy lieutenant.<br>
<br>Ornsby was a model parish priest and an accurate, painstaking antiquary. He was the lifelong friend of James Raine, the historian of north Durham. In 1846 he published a valuable little topographical work entitled <span class="italic">Sketches of Durham</span>, still a sought-after volume at the end of the twentieth century. For the Surtees Society he edited Dean Granville's <span class="italic">Remains</span>, (2 vols., 1861 and 1865), Bishop John Cosin's <span class="italic">Correspondence</span> (2 vols., 1869&#150;72), and <span class="italic">Selections from the Household Books of Lord William Howard of Naworth</span> (1878). He also undertook for the same society an edition of Dean Thomas Comber's <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, but never finished it. In 1877 he wrote the historical introduction to the volume of sermons preached at the reopening of Durham Cathedral, and in 1882 his <span class="italic">Diocesan History of York</span> was published. Ornsby died at his home in Fishlake on 17 April 1886.<br>
