<span class="headword">Sherwood <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Butt]</span>,  Mary Martha</span>  (1775&#150;1851), <span class="occ">children's writer and educationist</span>, was born on 6 May 1775, at Stanford rectory, Worcestershire, the second child and the older daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4221/', "Revd George Butt (1741&#150;1795)")</script>, appointed a chaplain in ordinary to George III in 1784, and his wife, Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sherwood (<i>d</i>. 1817). She was raised and educated in a prosperous but strict home. Tall, well-formed, and auburn-haired, Mary was called Hygeia by her father. Wearing an iron collar to which a backboard was attached, she stood uncomplainingly for daily lessons from her mother; she learned Latin from her father and Greek from her brother, Marten. At fifteen she was sent as a parlour boarder to the Abbey School for Girls at Reading, run by M. and Mme Saint-Quentin. At seventeen she completed her first published story, <span class="italic">Traditions</span> (1794), which her father discovered and shepherded into print, for the benefit of their ruined friend, M. Saint-Quentin; lamenting the &#145;ridiculous and serious defect&#146; of having &#145;the two wives of the hero existing at the same time&#146;  (Kelly, 123), Sherwood recalls her juvenilia in her journal (fifteen volumes edited and abridged to one by her daughter Sophia) as exhibiting &#145;a mind very far from mature&#146;  (Darton, 160).<br>
<br>After George Butt's death, on 29 September 1795, his widow and children settled at Bridgnorth, Shropshire, where Mary wrote <span class="italic">Margarita</span> (1802), sold in 1798 for &pound;40 to Mr Hazard of Bath, and <span class="italic">Susan Grey</span> (1802), sold for &pound;10. She admits having her head &#145;full of romantic imagery&#146; and being &#145;singularly ignorant of life&#146;  (Kelly, 163). At the curate's urging, she and her sister Lucy took charge of the Sunday school, where Mary read successive chapters of <span class="italic">Susan Grey</span> to the older girls as warnings against the promises of military men, &#145;who were there today and gone tomorrow&#146;  (Kelly, 220). In spite of this view, on 30 June 1803, she married her cousin, Captain Henry Sherwood (1776&#150;1849), of the 53rd foot regiment, who was appointed paymaster the next year. Life in the barracks at Sunderland, co. Durham, was solitary and bleak. Her first child, Mary Henrietta, was born in 1804 at Morpeth, Northumberland, another military base. She accompanied Captain Sherwood when he was ordered to India in 1805, reluctantly leaving the child with her mother and sister &#145;to save her health from the effects of other climes&#146;  (Kelly, 263).<br>
<br>The four-month journey round the Cape to Madras, while Mary Sherwood was pregnant again, was full of perils, including attacks from French warships. In their ten-year stay in India, the growing Sherwood family moved from Calcutta to Dinapore, Berhampore, Cawnpore, and Meerut. &#145;Never without a baby&#146;  (Kelly, 303), Sherwood bore four daughters and two sons in India; her first son, Henry, and second daughter, Lucy, died in infancy. Sherwood was convinced that the Indian nurse of the beatific Henry, &#145;paler and fairer than polished marble&#146;  (Kelly, 318), had poisoned him with opium. With evangelical fervour, she set up schools in each of the postings and wrote about family life in an Indian setting. From Cawnpore her husband sent the amazingly successful <span class="italic">Little Henry and his Bearer</span> (1815; 37th edn by 1850), the tale of an angelic, dying eight-year-old British orphan who catechizes and directs the conversion of his Hindu bearer Boosy (with the consequent loss of caste), to her sister, who sold it to Mr Hazard of Wellington for &pound;5; in her lifetime it was translated into French, German, Spanish, Hindustani, Chinese, and Sinhalese. The complementary tract, <span class="italic">Little Lucy and her Dhaye</span> (1825) highlights a similar turn from Sinbad stories to sacred texts, along with the conversion of the Indian nurse. Despite her contention that <span class="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</span> was &#145;ill-suited to the genius of the East&#146;, Sherwood relied on &#145;this work of honest old John's&#146;  (Kelly, 417) for two Bunyanesque redactions, <span class="italic">The Indian Pilgrim</span> (1818) and <span class="italic">The Infant's Progress</span> (1821), the former concentrating on the supposed depravity and pagan idolatry of Brahmans, fakirs, nautch (dance) girls, and soldiers' temporary wives, and the latter, also composed in India, using abstract topography and introducing Sherwood's own malicious sprite, Inbred-Sin. On the family voyage to Meerut she drafted <span class="italic">The Fairchild Family</span> (1818; 2nd pt, 1842; 3rd pt, 1847), the quintessential reading experience, according to F. J. Harvey Darton  (p. ix), for every nineteenth-century middle-class child. India remained a rich resource throughout her long career, as evidenced in tracts and novels such as <span class="italic">George Desmond</span> (1821), <span class="italic">Henry Milner</span> (1823) and its sequel <span class="italic">John Marten</span> (1844), and <span class="italic">The Indian Orphans</span> (1839).<br>
<br>On Mary Sherwood's return to England in 1816, with her own family, two adopted orphans, and a motherless girl making up a numerous and expensive brood, she devoted the rest of her long life to writing (over 400 titles are assigned to her) and teaching. Abhorring debt and without &#145;ready money to throw away&#146;  (Darton, 440), she made use of her voluntary work in India by establishing a boarding-school &#145;for the education of a few young ladies&#146;  (Darton, 438&#150;9) in English, French, astronomy, history, geography, grammar, writing, and ciphering, at Wick, Worcestershire. With dogmatic fervour, she edited Sarah Fielding's <span class="italic">The Governess</span> (1820), a project promised to her mother, who died on 20 March 1817. On half pay in the Brunswick hussars, Captain Sherwood opened a little school in Henwick, Worcestershire. Her eighth child, George, born in 1819, died in infancy. She taught her children Hebrew while working on a dictionary of <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> types; Captain Sherwood laboured for ten years on a Hebrew&#150;English concordance.<br>
<br>Whether writing for children or adults, Mary Sherwood was unwilling to temper her conviction of inherent human corruption. Mr Fairchild conducts his quarrelling youngsters to view the rotting corpse of a fratricide on a gibbet to teach them &#145;that our hearts by nature are full of hatred&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fairchild Family</span>, 59). Sherwood's visit to her brother's parsonage at Oddingley, Worcestershire, resulted in the two-part <span class="italic">The Oddingley Murders</span> (1830), a grisly true story of the murder of the pastor, the subsequent execution of the assassin hired by local folk who resisted tithes, and the wanting &#145;spirit of harmony and benevolence&#146; in this &#145;unhappy parish&#146;  (pp. 6&#150;7). Literature for all ranks had a catechetical utility for Sherwood, whether in the four-volume <span class="italic">The lady of the manor, being conversations on confirmation intended for the use of the middle and higher ranks of females</span> (1825&#150;9), or her short contributions to <span class="italic">The Youth's Magazine</span>, or her editorship of <span class="italic">The Child's Magazine</span>. The dynamics of family life, always reflecting the foundational importance of Christian principles, also informed her work, from the piety of the English boarder in <span class="italic">The Flowers of the Forest</span> (1830), the Christian education of the boy-narrator in <span class="italic">The Babes in the Wood of the New World</span> (1830), and the fond memories of <span class="italic">The Happy Family</span> (1838), to the instructive contrasts between siblings in the historical novels she completed with the help of her daughter Sophia, <span class="italic">The Mirror of Maidens in the Days of Queen Bess</span> (1851) and <span class="italic">The Two Knights, or, Delancey Castle: a Tale of the Civil Wars</span> (1851). Although her anti-Catholicism was a staple of the times, it became particularly virulent with her characterization of greedy Father Peter in the allegory <span class="italic">The Latter Days</span> (1833), her lurid descriptions of the &#145;frightful prison house&#146;  (p. 53) and &#145;various little low cabals&#146;  (p. 2) of the convent in the gothic novel <span class="italic">The Nun</span> (1833; 5 edns to 1860), and the blistering depiction of religious houses in another gothic, <span class="italic">The Monk of Cimi&egrave;s</span> (1834). An abolitionist whose attitude toward the indigene was condescending yet occasionally sympathetic, resolutely maintaining that native beliefs ought to be supplanted by Christianity, she succeeded in creating compelling portraits of Dazee in <span class="italic">The Re-Captured Negro</span> (1821) and Thomas Wilson in <span class="italic">The Poor Man of Colour</span> (1830).<br>
<br>Mary Sherwood's travels and acquaintances expanded her circle of influence and experience. She was definitely more at ease during a meeting with William Wilberforce, in 1820, at the china manufactory in Worcester, when he wanted to hear about India, and in her coach ride to Worcester gaol with Elizabeth Fry, in 1821, where they talked about &#145;the dangers of celebrity, for females especially&#146;  (Kelly, 537), than she had been, before her marriage, during an audience at Bath with Hannah More, who &#145;spoke well&#146; but whose sisters &#145;gathered up her words carefully, rather Boswellian-like&#146;  (Kelly, 217). Throughout the 1830s the Sherwoods travelled extensively on the continent, especially in France and Switzerland; on the return vessel from Holland, in 1832, she met the frail, invalided Sir Walter Scott, to whom she lent pen and ink. Sherwood's work regimen remained prodigious; until her mid-seventies, she read the smallest print, wrote four to five hours each day, and considered herself &#145;one of the very happiest old women that ever cumbered this earth&#146;  (Kelly, 573). In 1849 Captain and Mrs Sherwood left Worcester for Isleworth and then Twickenham, Middlesex, where Captain Sherwood died on 6 December, Mary Sherwood following him on 20 September 1851.<br>
