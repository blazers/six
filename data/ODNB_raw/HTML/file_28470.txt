<span class="headword">Walker, Sir  Baldwin Wake</span>, first baronet  (1802&#150;1876), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 6 January 1802. He was the only surviving son of John Walker of Whitehaven (<i>d</i>. 1822) and Frances (<i>d</i>. 1812), daughter of Captain Drury Wake of the 17th dragoons (second son of Sir William Wake, seventh baronet; 1742&#150;1846). He entered the navy in July 1812, was made a lieutenant on 6 April 1820, and served for two years on the Jamaica station, then for three years on the coast of South America and the west coast of Africa. In 1827 he went to the Mediterranean in the <i>Rattlesnake</i>, and in 1828 was first lieutenant of the bomb-vessel <i>Etna</i> at the capture of Kastro Morea. For this service he received the cross of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and that of the Redeemer of Greece. He continued in the Mediterranean, serving in the <i>Asia</i>, <i>Britannia</i>, and <i>Barham</i>, and was made commander on 15 July 1834. He served in the <i>Vanguard</i>, in the Mediterranean, from September 1836 until his promotion to post rank on 24 November 1838. With Admiralty permission he then accepted a command in the Turkish navy, in which he was known at first as Walker Bey, and afterwards as Yavir Pasha.<br>
<br>In July 1839, on hearing of the death of Sultan Mahmud II, and anticipating Russian dominance at Constantinople, instead of sailing to attack the Egyptian fleet the Capitan Pasha took his ships to Alexandria and delivered them to Mehmet Ali, who then refused to let them go. Walker was taken with them. He summoned the Turkish captains to a council of war and proposed to them to land in the night, surround the palace, carry off Mehmet Ali, and send him to Constantinople. But the plan was not attempted and Walker went back to Constantinople alone on a steamer sent by Sir Robert Stopford, the British naval commander-in-chief. In the capital Walker in effect acted as commander-in-chief of the Turkish navy. In the summer of 1840 he prepared and took command of a combined expedition to Syria, slipping at night past a reputedly hostile French squadron watching off the Dardanelles. In September and November he co-operated with Turkey's allies in the reduction of Beirut, Sidon, and Acre, showing great gallantry, both in organizing naval operations and in landing and leading detachments of Turkish troops to seize the towns in the name of the sultan. In January 1841 he had the pleasure of arriving at Alexandria to reconduct the Turkish fleet to Constantinople. He was nominated a KCB on 12 January 1841; he received from the allied sovereigns the second class of the Iron Crown of Austria, of St Anne of Russia, of the Red Eagle of Prussia, and was made a hereditary pasha of the Turkish empire.<br>
<br>Walker was responsible for important reforms in the Turkish navy, but intrigue ensured his dismissal in January 1844. He returned to England, and in 1845 he commanded the <i>Queen</i>, designed by the surveyor Sir William Symonds, which, in sailing trials, beat all rivals. In 1846&#150;7 he commanded the frigate <i>Constance</i> in the Pacific, being recalled to succeed Symonds. His first duty as surveyor was to bring calm to an office disturbed by controversy, but soon he became engaged with planning the change to a steam line of battle. With the Crimean War, Walker became the main naval adviser to the first lord, and on occasions the only one. His advice was important in prompting the expedition to Sevastopol. He was created a baronet on 19 July 1856, and on 5 January 1858 he became a rear-admiral. By 1858 the question of the introduction of the seagoing ironclad was coming to the fore, and Walker was responsible for proposing the <i>Warrior</i>, whose size and speed owed much to his advice. In 1860 Walker was given greater powers of control and independent judgement over the dockyards, his title changing to controller.<br>
<br>Walker did not avoid controversy during his time in office. In 1851&#150;2 he defeated an attempt to introduce political criteria into dockyard officer appointments. Late in the decade there were accusations of gross waste in warship construction and conversion; these were very trying to Walker, involving disputes within the Admiralty as well as without, and heavy demands from parliament for returns and for Walker himself to give evidence before investigating committees. By the end of 1860, after years of long office hours and strain, Walker was exhausted, scarcely able to write a letter. The board accepted his resignation in January 1861, appointing him to the Cape command (1861&#150;4) in the hope that the climate would re-establish his health. He left just in time to avoid another parliamentary inquiry, his flagship outpacing the steamer sent to recall him; this led to some comment, including satirical verses in <span class="italic">Punch</span> (on 23 March 1861).<br>
<br>Walker's quick recovery at the Cape was especially fortunate since he had to prepare for hostilities with the USA after the <i>Trent</i> incident, and did so with enthusiasm, primarily through a wish to teach &#145;Brother Jonathan&#146; a lesson but also hoping for prize money and to improve his fortune, over which he had several times been disappointed. The dispute was settled, but Walker still had to deal with complications with the Americans, largely because of the visit of the Confederate commerce raider <i>Alabama</i> to the Cape. Other responsibilities included slave trade patrols, David Livingstone's expedition, the extension of the dockyard at Simonstown, a quiet conflict over precedence with the Cape chief justice, and the protection of his three unmarried daughters from importunate naval officers.<br>
<br>Walker became a vice-admiral on 10 February 1865. His next employment was his last, as commander-in-chief at Sheerness (1866&#150;9). He became a full admiral on 27 February 1870, shortly afterwards going on to the retired list. He had married, on 9 September 1834, Mary Catherine Sinclair (<i>d</i>. 1889), only daughter of Captain John Worth RN of Oakley House, Suffolk; they had five sons and four daughters. He lost both a son, Charles, and a son-in-law, Captain Hugh Talbot Burgoyne, when the <i>Captain</i> went down on 7 September 1870. Walker died at his home, The Depperhaugh, Hoxne, Suffolk, on 12 February 1876. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, Sir Baldwin Wake Walker (1846&#150;1905), a naval officer and at one time assistant director of torpedoes. A grandson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36678/', "Sir William Frederic Wake-Walker")</script>, was controller of the navy from 1942 to 1945.<br>
<br>Walker was highly regarded as a seaman. He was also hard-working and generally popular with colleagues and subordinates. In matters of personal honour he was punctilious, this circumscribing a sense of humour that was perhaps never highly developed. One of his great strengths was what Sir William Symonds described as his &#145;own quiet mild and discreet persuasive manner&#146;  (W. Symonds to Walker, 7 Jan 1848). His tenure as surveyor&#150;controller was historically significant, marking the change from that officer being a naval architect to a policy maker, and an important stage on his development into becoming the acknowledged head of naval <i>mat&eacute;riel</i> and a lord of the Admiralty. Walker was a good and careful administrator, but did not possess much imagination or prescience, above all concerning the supersession of the screw liner by the ironclad battleship, where, despite the <i>Warrior</i>, his influence was often retrograde. Surviving photographs principally suggest the administrator, but a painting of Walker in Turkish service, in the possession of the family, is in a heroic tradition suitable to the subject's undeniable gallantry.<br>
