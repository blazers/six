<span class="headword">Matheson, Sir  Alexander</span>, first baronet  (1805&#150;1886), <span class="occ">merchant and banker</span>, was born on 16 January 1805 at Attadale, Ross-shire, the eldest of the seven children of John Matheson and Catherine, daughter of Captain Donald Matheson of Shinness, and sister of Sir James Matheson, first baronet (1796&#150;1878).<br>
<br>Following his education at the University of Edinburgh, Matheson pursued a career in commerce in Asia, first at Calcutta, and subsequently at Canton (Guangzhou), where he joined his uncle James's firm of Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. Founded in 1832, that partnership was an agency house of major importance, undertaking marketing for correspondent merchants in Britain, India, and parts of south-east Asia. As the firm developed, it was also active in finance, insurance, and shipping. Its most profitable commodity was opium, which was sold, illegally, both at Canton, and along the coast of China; but the firm avoided drawing on its own account for large-scale speculation in opium.<br>
<br>A partner in the firm from 1835, Matheson found himself in the midst of the incidents which led to the First Opium War (1839&#150;42). In the late 1830s the Chinese imperial government was determined to crush the opium trade, and for that purpose it appointed Lin Zexu imperial commissioner at Canton. Arriving in March 1839, Lin demanded the surrender of all the opium stocks of foreign merchants, and he held as hostages James Matheson and fifteen other merchants. James sent Alexander down to the Gulf of Canton to manage the firm's opium fleet during the crisis. Thus, when the British superintendent of trade, under severe pressure from Lin, directed the merchants to surrender their opium supplies, Alexander Matheson was responsible for gathering Jardine Matheson's quantity (7000 chests) for destruction by Chinese officials.<br>
<br>Not long after the release of the hostages in May 1839, Matheson returned to London to pursue the company's claim for compensation from the British government. He and his partner, William Jardine (1784&#150;1843), lobbied for a forceful response by the government, and both men testified before the parliamentary committee on China. During this stay in Britain, Matheson married, in 1840, Mary, the daughter of James Macleod, a neighbour of the Mathesons in Ross-shire. However, his young wife died early in 1841.<br>
<br>By the spring of 1841, Matheson was <i>en route</i> for China, accompanying the new British plenipotentiary, Sir Henry Pottinger. He returned to the Far East a lonely man. Often experiencing poor health, he was also characteristically dyspeptic in temperament. Arriving at Macau in August 1841, Matheson resumed his role in the firm's business. In the course of the First Opium War, British forces had taken possession of Hong Kong, and as early as the spring of 1842, Matheson was writing to a London correspondent that Hong Kong &#145;has already thrown Macao into the Shade&#146;  (Matheson to T. C. Smith, 10 May 1842, CUL, letter-book C6/2). The island was formally acquired by the treaty of Nanking (Nanjing; 1842). Two years later, Jardine Matheson moved its headquarters to Hong Kong, and the staff celebrated their first night there with a dinner at Alexander's bungalow in Happy Valley.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of the war, Britain's trade opportunities in China expanded dramatically, but opium itself remained an illegal commodity. Alexander Matheson hoped that Pottinger would not succeed in getting the opium trade legalized. He wrote to a major supplier in India: &#145;You may rest assured that if ever the trade is legalized, it will cease to be profitable from that time. The more difficulties attend it, the better for you and us&#146;  (Matheson to Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, 10 Sept 1843, CUL, letter-book C6/3). With the trade in opium increasing after the war, he was contemptuous of those at home who objected to it on moral grounds. &#145;The cry against the drug trade in England is certainly very absurd, &amp; I sincerely hope the saints will fail in their attempt to interfere with it&#146;  (ibid., 28 March 1843).<br>
<br>Following James Matheson's departure from China early in 1842 Alexander Matheson became the <i>taipan</i> of Jardine Matheson, dividing his time between Hong Kong and Macau. He remained the senior partner until 1852, but he left China in 1847, arriving in London as a banking crisis was about to jeopardize many of the major financial institutions in the City. Upon discovering that the firm of Magniac Jardine was vulnerable, Matheson engineered the rescue of that firm, with financial assistance from his uncle and from the portion of William Jardine's estate inherited by Andrew Jardine. In the following year the firm was reorganized as a new partnership, Matheson &amp; Co., which was to function as the agency house in London for Jardine Matheson. Alexander Matheson served as senior partner of Matheson &amp; Co. into the 1870s. Under his leadership that firm was vital to the growth of Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. as a commercial giant in the Far East. As Jardine's London representatives, Matheson &amp; Co. imported into Britain a broad range of commodities, including teas and silks, and exported to the Far East coal, machinery, metals, wines, and liquors. Moreover, they recruited personnel to staff the expanding Jardine enterprises.<br>
<br>Just after his return from China in 1847, Matheson was elected MP for the Inverness burghs, and held that seat until 1868, when his uncle retired from the Commons. He thereupon succeeded his uncle as MP for the county of Ross and Cromarty, which he represented as a Liberal until 1884. He served as a deputy lieutenant for Ross and Cromarty, for Inverness, and for the City of London.<br>
<br>Matheson's purchases of Scottish estates had begun during his brief return home in 1840&#150;41, with the acquisition of 6000 acres south of Lochalsh. The ancestral lands of his family at Lochalsh, Ross-shire, were added in 1851, and ten years later he purchased the ancestral properties at Attadale. He spent nearly &pound;0.75 million buying estates in Ross-shire, where he held over 220,000 acres; the total purchase and improvement costs of his Scottish estates exceeded &pound;1.46 million.<br>
<br>Matheson served as a director of the Bank of England, 1847&#150;84; he was also for many years chairman of the Highland Railway, and was credited with a central role in the construction of the railways throughout northern Scotland. In 1882, in reward for his public service, he was awarded a baronetcy. His second marriage, in 1853, was to Lavinia Mary (<i>d</i>. 1855), the youngest daughter of Thomas Stapleton of Carlton, Yorkshire. They had a son and a daughter. In 1860 Matheson married his third wife, Eleanor Irving (<i>d</i>. 1879), the daughter of Spencer Perceval and Anna Macleod. This marriage produced three sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Although he left China in 1847, Alexander Matheson was head of the firm from 1842 to 1852. When his cousin, Donald Matheson, resigned on conscience grounds in 1848, Matheson participation in the senior management on site in China effectively ended. None of Alexander's sons pursued a business career in the Far East. The Mathesons focused their attention on Matheson &amp; Co. in London for another thirty years until the Jardine family became predominant in that firm. Matheson apparently experienced financial problems in his last four years, but it is not known whether these were caused by ill-judged investments or the effect of the agricultural depression on his vast land holdings. He nevertheless left estate in the UK worth over &pound;600,000 at his death on 26 July 1886, at 38 Hill Street, off Berkeley Square, London. Sir Kenneth Matheson, his son and heir, was required to part with the greater portion of the lands, but the family was able to retain possession of the ancestral estates in Ross-shire including Attadale.<br>
