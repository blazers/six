<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walker,  Obadiah</span>  (1616&#150;1699), <span class="occ">college head and author</span>, was born at Darfield, near Barnsley, the son of William Walker of Worsbrough Dale in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He was baptized at his father's parish on 17 September 1616. Nothing is known of his schooling. He matriculated at Oxford on 5 April 1633, having previously entered University College. The learned Abraham Woodhead, a Yorkshire compatriot, was assigned his tutor. The appointment marked the beginning of a lifelong intimacy between them. A ready scholar with an aptitude for languages Walker displayed an appetite for learning well beyond the bounds of the arts curriculum. He was elected Freiston exhibitioner on 1 October 1633 and a perpetual fellow on 10 August 1635. He graduated BA on 4 July 1635, and MA on 23 April 1638. Shortly afterwards he received ordination in the Church of England. A born teacher he inspired intellectual endeavour and personal affection in his tutorial pupils.<br>
<br>In the great rebellion Walker took the king's side. On 1 September 1642 he and Woodhead were nominated delegates for the defence of the university, a tribute to his standing in Oxford. Membership of the delegacy brought him into contact with the leaders of Anglican royalism, especially Gilbert Sheldon. Unlike Woodhead, Walker remained at his post throughout the war, and discharged the office of college bursar. He preached before Charles I: a privilege which earned him his grace for the degree of BD in June 1646. Modestly, he waived the degree.<br>
<br>With the surrender of Oxford, Walker was exposed to the wrath of the victorious rebel parliament. Arraigned before the parliamentary visitors he deferred submission on 19 May 1648, &#145;as beinge yet unsatisfied&#146; of the lawfulness of the visitation. Three days later he was ordered to be expelled, and was finally ejected from his fellowship on 7 July for &#145;high contempt of the authoritie of Parliament&#146;  (Burrows, 103, 143).<h2>
<a name="InterregnumandRestoration"></a>Interregnum and Restoration</h2>Walker made a virtue of necessity by electing to travel. Intent on improving himself &#145;in all kinds of polite literature&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), he visited Paris and Rome. His time abroad stimulated his interest in different societies. Already a classicist he developed a passion for numismatics and antiquities that stayed with him for life. For the first time he encountered the splendours and challenges of Counter-Reformation Catholicism. He undertook, about 1650, on the recommendation of John Evelyn, to act as tutor to Henry and Charles, the sons of Henry Hildyard, of Horsley, Surrey. In October 1655 he and his pupils were at Basel. The conversion to Rome of his elder pupil, Henry Hildyard, suggested that Walker was, to say no more, complacent in his attitude to Catholicism.<br>
<br>After wandering &#145;a long time up and down&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) Walker returned to England. In 1659 he published at London his first book, <span class="italic">Some Instruction Concerning the Art of Oratory</span>, the fruit of his years of study and teaching. At his return it is likely that he renewed his acquaintance with Sheldon through his friend Abraham Woodhead, whose poverty Sheldon is known to have relieved. Following the Restoration both Walker and Woodhead, as well as Sheldon, were reinstated in their Oxford preferment. On 15 August 1660 Charles II's commissioners for visiting the university ordered the removal of the intruded fellows and the restoration of Walker and Woodhead, the &#145;lawfull and undoubted Fellowes of the said Colledg[e]&#146;  (Beddard, <span class="italic">Restoration Oxford</span>, 1.164).<br>
<br>Walker found it difficult to settle down. He soon set off on his travels. Again, he made for Rome as a private tutor. The college gave him repeated leave of absence, granting him four terms away in August 1661, on 31 January 1663, and 23 March 1664, and a further two terms on 14 January 1665, after the expiry of which he kept residence. On the death of the royalist master, Dr Thomas Walker, he voted for his successor, Richard Clayton, on 6 December 1665. Abroad he observed the &#145;divers communities&#146; through which he passed and conversed with &#145;their most eminent directors and professors&#146;, experiences which distinguished him from most stay-at-home Oxford dons. At his homecoming he was, according to the Benedictine monk Richard Reeve, in every way &#145;best qualified for the advancement and direction of collegiate and academicall studies&#146;  (Beddard, &#145;James II&#146;, 922&#150;3).<br>
<br>Walker was soon drawn back into the intellectual and administrative life of the university. He found a powerful patron in Dean John Fell of Christ Church. As a royalist cleric who reverenced the early fathers and a seasoned tutor who loved history and the classics, he fitted easily into Restoration Oxford. Fell did more than befriend him, he employed him in some of his enterprises. In 1667 Walker became a delegate of the newly founded university press. It was his influence that brought Anthony Wood the offer to publish his pioneering <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of Oxford</span>. A connoisseur of Roman antiquity he joined Evelyn to secure the Arundel marbles for the university in 1667.<br>
<br>Walker's knowledge of European scholarship and continental contacts enabled him to swell the foreign holdings of the public library. In the early 1670s he obtained Ciacconius's <span class="italic">Columna Trajani</span>, Peruta's <span class="italic">Book of Medals</span>, and &#145;other bookes from Rome&#146;. An informed bibliophile he helped to price duplicates in Bodley's library, the sale of which added to the book purchasing fund. In 1673 he published two works: <span class="italic">Of Education. Especially of Young Gentlemen</span>, a distillation of his teaching experience, which in 1699 reached its sixth edition; and <span class="italic">Artis rationis ad mentem nominalium libri tres</span>, an introduction to logic that made use of the medieval nominalists. He was behind the Oxford publication of Ockham's <span class="italic">Summa totius logicae</span> of 1675.<h2>
<a name="MasterofUniversityCollege"></a>Master of University College</h2>At the death of Richard Clayton on 14 June 1676 Walker, already the senior fellow, was an obvious choice for the mastership. He was unanimously elected on 22 June. He proved an active and popular head of house. An epistolary campaign, addressed to grandees and old members, raised money to complete the main quadrangle by erecting the eastern range. Following Fell's example he aspired to give an intellectual lead to his college. Calling on the assistance of his fellows he undertook an edition in Latin of Sir John Spelman's unpublished &#145;Life of Alfred&#146;, the reputed founder of University College. The work was chiefly intended to let the world know that its benefactions were, as he put it, &#145;not bestowed on mere drones&#146;  (Beddard, &#145;Tory Oxford&#146;, 864).<br>
<br>Paradoxically, the publication in 1678 of the <span class="italic">Vita Aelfredi</span> turned out to be a mixed blessing. While the elegantly printed folio, augmented by Walker's Old English erudition and illustrated by engravings of contemporary coinage, achieved its primary aim of justifying continuing financial support for his college, it also attracted condemnation in 1679 in&#151;of all places&#151;parliament. In the Commons that veteran sniffer out of popery, Sir Harbottle Grimston, detected a whiff of Romanism about the book. Walker's dedication to Charles II, who was fulsomely compared to the Catholic King Alfred, and seeming reconciliation of the royal supremacy with papal obedience, offended protestant prejudices. Grimston's anti-Catholicism, stirred up by Gilbert Burnet, had been directed against the master by two parliamentarian quondams of the college: Israel Tonge (Tongue) and William Shippen, who spied a chance to supplant him.<br>
<br>Matters were compounded by Walker's known friendship with the Catholic convert Abraham Woodhead. At his demise in May 1678 Woodhead had left Walker a property at Hoxton that was believed to be a popish school, and, though a Catholic and non-resident, Woodhead had been permitted to draw his fellowship stipend from the college since 1660. Notwithstanding the master's negative return when called on by the vice-chancellor to identify suspected Catholics in his society in February 1679, suspicions lingered on the score of his religion. This was not helped by the preaching in June 1680 of a &#145;popishly affected&#146; university sermon by one of his erstwhile pupils, Francis Nicholson, and by his publication of Woodhead's <span class="italic">Of the Benefits of Our Saviour Jesus Christ to Mankind</span>, also in 1680  (Beddard, &#145;James II&#146;, 918). Against the background of whig exertions to exclude a Catholic successor from the throne, the suggestion that any tory don sympathized with popery provoked widespread public concern.<br>
<br>Less controversially Walker published <span class="italic">Propositions Concerning Optic Glasses</span> (1679), proof of his interest in the experimental sciences, and &#145;A description of Greenland&#146;, which he contributed to volume one of <span class="italic">The English Atlas</span> (1680). In 1682 he submitted proposals to Elias Ashmole regarding his donation of the Tradescant &#145;Rarities&#146; to the university and the foundation of his museum.<h2>
<a name="TheCatholicchallenge"></a>The Catholic challenge</h2>Whatever the inner state of his convictions Walker did not avow himself a Catholic until 1686, the second year of James II's reign. In 1685 he published an anonymous life of Christ, which was instantly ascribed to him, albeit it was probably of Woodhead's composing. The honour which the volume accorded to Our Lady and the Petrine claims of Rome caused the vice-chancellor, Timothy Halton, to ban the sale of the master's books in Oxford, following a failed attempt to remove the unacceptable passages before it was printed. Fell, hitherto a friend, deleted Walker from his will as a lessee of the university's privilege of printing.<br>
<br>Unintimidated Walker stood his ground. He was joined by further converts: Nathaniel Boyse and Thomas Deane, fellows of University College, and John Barnard, fellow of Brasenose. Known as the master's &#145;three disciples&#146; they were in October 1686 joined by John Massey of Merton, Walker's former servitor. All four academics had long ago fallen under the spell of his cosmopolitan learning and attractive personality. In January 1686 the master was summoned to court. There he consulted John Leyburn, bishop of Adrumetum, the recently arrived vicar apostolic sent from Rome, and was persuaded to declare his conversion. Together they laid plans for protecting him and his companions. On returning to college he abstained from chapel prayers.<br>
<br>On 3 May James issued his dispensation, allowing the converts to retain their posts, and permitted free access to the royal court, which was to be their lifeline against Oxonian opposition. The accompanying licence authorized Walker to print, reprint, publish, and sell some thirty-six Catholic works, with an annual limit prescribed of 20,000 copies for any one title. James's optimism expected Walker, with his knowledge of the press, to make a massive contribution to the missionizing effort which, under royal auspices, began to forge ahead. Aided by Francis Nicholson, Walker began to publish apologetical pieces taken from Woodhead's manuscript writings.<br>
<br>Eager to gain converts Walker boldly erected a Catholic altar in the spring of 1686, using a garret in his lodgings. Growing attendances quickly overwhelmed the capacity of this and its downstairs successor. Armed with James's mandate in August, he annexed two ground floor rooms and made them into an oratory. Mass began to be celebrated publicly on the feast of the assumption. Walker invited the Jesuit priests Edward Humberston and Joseph Wakeman to act as chaplains. In January 1687 James commanded the appropriation of the sequestrated revenue of a fellowship to be applied to their upkeep. The king attended vespers in Walker's oratory during his state visit to Oxford in September 1687. Meanwhile, assured of James's countenance, Walker embarked on a policy of Catholic imperialism. He succeeded in advancing Massey to the deanery of Christ Church, and Barnard to the moral philosophy lectureship. He even admitted Catholic undergraduates to his college.<br>
<br>Denied access to the university press by his protestant adversaries Walker established his own in University College in 1687, from which he issued his first overtly Catholic work, Woodhead's <span class="italic">Two Discourses Concerning the Adoration of our Blessed Saviour in the Holy Eucharist</span>: a tract which elicited protestant replies, and, in turn, begot Walker's <span class="italic">Animadversions</span> (1688) on Henry Aldrich's strictures. His maintenance of the crown's traditional powers to make and unmake corporations, academical, ecclesiastical, and municipal, added political resentment to mounting confessional hatred. Unable to touch him the wits of Christ Church were reduced to bribing &#145;a poor natural&#146; to sing rhymed doggerel at his door:<blockquote>
<div>Oh, old Obadiah,<br>
</div>
<div>Sing <i>Ave Maria</i>,<br>
</div>
<div>But so will not I-a,<br>
</div>
<div>For why-a?<br>
</div>
<div>I had rather be a fool than a knave-a.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Le Fleming MSS</span>, 25, 200)</blockquote>His gratitude to the king was shown by his erection of James's statue over the inner gatehouse of the college in 1688. University College was one of the few societies in Oxford to celebrate the birth of the Catholic prince of Wales in June.<h2>
<a name="Revolutionimprisonmentanddestitution"></a>Revolution, imprisonment, and destitution</h2>The protestant reckoning, when it came, was swift. On 9 November 1688, four days after William of Orange's invasion, Walker packed up his books, barred his door, and left his lodgings for London to be near a monarch who could no longer protect him. Seeing flight as his only option he made for the coast. On 11 December he was arrested at Sittingbourne in the company of Bishop Giffard of Madura, former president of Magdalen, and Father Poulton, schoolmaster of the Savoy. Committed to Maidstone gaol they were subsequently removed to the Tower. Meantime, acting on a complaint from the fellows, the vice-chancellor, Ironside, and the visitors of University College proceeded on 4 February 1689 to declare the mastership vacant and to confirm the election of a new master.<br>
<br>On 23 October, the first day of term, a writ of habeas corpus was moved for Walker, whereupon the House of Commons ordered him to be brought to the bar. He was charged with being reconciled to the Church of Rome and other &#145;high crimes and misdemeanours&#146;, and remanded back to the Tower as a traitor. He remained a prisoner until 30 January 1690 when, after an appearance in king's bench, he was reluctantly freed &#145;on great security&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times of Anthony Wood</span>, 3.324). His bail was discharged on 2 June. He was excepted from the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span>. Thereafter he lived privately in London, regained his customary equipoise, and reapplied his mind to scholarship, publishing <span class="italic">Some Instruction in the Art of Grammar</span> (1691) for would-be Latinists, and a <span class="italic">Greek and Roman History Illustrated by Coins and Medals</span> (1692). He never married.<br>
<br>Walker's former scholar, the eminent physician Dr John Radcliffe, whom he had tried unsuccessfully to convert to Rome, &#145;sent him once a year a new suit of clothes, with ten broad pieces and twelve bottles of richest canary to support his drooping spirits&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Increasingly infirm with age he was offered a home by Radcliffe. He died in London on 21 January 1699, and was interred in St Pancras's churchyard, where Radcliffe erected a tombstone with the memorial inscription: &#145;O. W. per bonam famam et infamiam&#146; (&#145;Obadiah Walker through good fame and ill&#146;). The extent of his infamy was that, like James II, to whom he remained loyal to the end, he had preferred the Catholic religion to the Church of England. Stripped of confessional obloquy his reputation as one of the most productive scholars of Restoration Oxford still stands. His ghost is reputed to haunt staircase 8 of University College.<br>
