<span class="headword">Mede <span class="st"> [Mead]</span>,  Joseph</span>  (1586&#150;1638), <span class="occ">Hebraist and biblical scholar</span>, was born in October 1586 at Berden, Essex, of unknown parents &#145;of honest rank&#146;, according to the &#145;Life&#146; contained in his collected works, and was related through his father to Sir John Mede (or Mead) of Wenden Lofts, near Bishop's Stortford. When Mede was ten his father died of smallpox, and his mother married a Gower of Naseing, Essex, by whom he was sent to school, first at Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, and later at Wethersfield, Essex. While at Wethersfield, and on a trip to London, he purchased a copy of Bellarmine's <span class="italic">Institutiones linguae Hebraicae</span> and by the time he left school had, without any instruction, obtained a considerable working knowledge of Hebrew. In 1603 he matriculated as sizar at Christ's College, Cambridge, where he studied first under Daniel Rogers and then under William Addison, before graduating BA in 1607 and proceeding MA in 1610. In 1613 he was elected to succeed Hugh Broughton to the King Edward VI fellowship through the influence of Lancelot Andrewes, then bishop of Ely, after having been passed over several times on suspicion of having &#145;too much &hellip; tenderness to the Puritan faction&#146;  (Mede, 850). Valentine Cary, master of Christ's, may eventually have been disposed to view him more favourably on account of his friendship with Sir Martin Stuteville of Dalham, who was also a friend of Mede. In 1618 Mede was appointed Mildmay Greek lecturer, holding both fellowship and lectureship for the rest of his life. He did not marry, and lived modestly in a chamber at ground level beneath the college library.<br>
<br>Mede was a man of wide interests and considerable attainment. In addition to his skills in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin and his knowledge of the biblical text in English and the original languages, he was proficient in several other disciplines. His early biographer describes him as &#145;an acute logician, an accurate philosopher, a skilful mathematician, a great philologer, and an excellent anatomist&#146;  (Worthington, ii). By invitation he frequently attended dissections at Gonville and Caius College. He was also proficient in botany, physics, and history, and was interested in astrology. He is said to have been as deeply versed in ecclesiastical antiquities and knowledge of the Greek and Latin fathers &#145;as any man living&#146;  (Brook, 429). His pursuit of knowledge and his scholarly achievements, including his biblical studies, were marked by a love of truth for its own sake. &#145;I cannot believe&#146;, he is reported as saying, &#145;that truth can be prejudiced by the discovery of truth&#146;  (ibid., 431). A period of scepticism early in his reading of philosophy, which led towards Pyrrhonism, gave way to devout belief. As has been observed, &#145;escaping the jaws of atheism, he fled towards faith&#146;  (Firth, 214).<br>
<br>Despite his profound erudition, Mede was a man of great modesty and humility. John Worthington, who is generally credited with the &#145;Life&#146; of Mede prefixed to later editions of his <span class="italic">Works</span>, says he was &#145;studiously regardless&#146; of formal academic attainment, ecclesiastical preferment, and worldly advantage  (Worthington, xv). He eschewed higher degrees beyond the BD, which he took in 1618, and in 1627 and again in 1630 declined the provostship of Trinity College, Dublin, an opening made possible on the recommendation of Archbishop James Ussher, who is said to have sought Mede's assistance in the determination of his own great work on sacred chronology. Among Mede's pupils, whom he treated with great consideration, were several who achieved distinction, including John Milton and Henry More. Although his income was meagre Mede regularly gave one-tenth to charitable causes. He maintained good personal relationships and was known for his openness and generosity towards those who opposed him. He suffered throughout life from a speech impediment which, particularly in the early years, led him to decline many invitations to speak in public. He persevered with the defect, however, and was able to preach without noticeable hesitation.<br>
<br>Mede's theological and ecclesiological allegiance was finally settled in favour of moderation and episcopacy, although he was included in Benjamin Brook's <span class="italic">The Lives of the Puritans</span> (1813) and had some puritan sympathies. Worthington notes his &#145;reverential regard to the established government and discipline of the Church&#146;  (Worthington, xxx), and Ussher's support and, more strikingly, Andrewes's invitation to him to become his chaplain cannot be ignored. Brook refers to Mede's correspondence with several eminent nonconformists and his fear that Roman rites would prevail again in the Church of England. Mede's view of Rome as the Antichrist and his conviction of the necessity of a godly life were both puritan emphases. They were balanced, however, by his concern that some puritan arguments opened the door to Socinianism and by his condemnation of a book by John Bastwick in a letter to Samuel Hartlib. He also opposed presbyterian discipline and practice. It would be incorrect to denominate him a party man in any strict sense, since a spirit of fraternal ecumenicity marked his outlook. He sought charity and mutual forbearance, &#145;the owning of each other as brethren and members of the same body whereof Christ is the head&#146;  (ibid., xvii). Remaining loyal to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> and prayer book liturgy, he expected that more would be achieved from mutual respect and toleration than by any attempt to legislate or impose uniformity.<br>
<br>Mede is notable for his works on biblical eschatology, and especially for <span class="italic">Clavis Apocalyptica</span> (1627), translated into English posthumously by Richard More and published as <span class="italic">The Key of the Revelation</span> (1643). It enjoyed the almost universal praise of contemporaries in England and on the continent and deeply influenced the development of eschatological thought in seventeenth-century England. Despite being intended originally only for private circulation among a select academic audience, it was published three times in Latin and in English between 1627 and 1650. The second Latin (1632) and subsequent English editions included Mede's <span class="italic">In sancti Joannis Apocalypsin commentarius</span>, a commentary on the <span class="roman">Apocalypse</span>, and the <span class="italic">Key</span> and the commentary, together with his other eschatological works, sufficiently emphasized the coming millennium to justify Mede being regarded as the father of English millenarianism. Given the radical nature of much of the ensuing millenarian activity, it was a reputation that Mede would have sought to avoid almost at any cost. He claimed to have reached his own moderate millenarian convictions with reluctance, having honestly endeavoured to locate the millennium in the past as had other interpreters, including Thomas Brightman and Hugo Grotius. His study of the biblical text, however, would not permit that conclusion. In anticipating a future millennium Mede did not consider that he was proposing extreme or heretical doctrine, but rather a return to the belief of the early church. The view that Mede derived his millenarianism from continental sources, particularly Alsted and Pareus, is outweighed by his own testimony and that of contemporaries. His biographer comments, &#145;He proceeded upon grounds never traced by any, and infinitely more probable than any laid down by those who before him undertook that task&#146;  (Worthington, vii). Fuller remarked that the Fifth Monarchists had driven the nail &#145;which Master Mede did first enter further than he ever intended it&#146;  (Fuller, 335). It remains fair comment on Mede's own millenarian position, and is supported by the later view that it was due to the efforts of others after his death that Mede was &#145;transformed from scholar to prophet&#146;  (Firth, 228). Most of his works were first published posthumously.<br>
<br>The distinctive element of the <span class="italic">Clavis Apocalyptica</span>, and Mede's unique contribution to contemporary and subsequent prophetic studies, was the noted synchronisms, which he argued were essential to a correct understanding of the book of <span class="roman">Revelation</span>. Within the context of the prevailing historicist interpretation of apocalyptic prophecy, the thesis underlying the synchronisms was that the major prophetic outlines in the books of <span class="roman">Daniel</span> and the <span class="roman">Revelation</span> were inter-related, contingent on each other, and that at many points they overlapped in scope, depicting the same era or events with different emphases. This was Mede's &#145;Law of Synchronistical necessity&#146;  (Mede, 583). It proposed to unlock the mysteries of apocalyptic prophecy making them accessible and relevant to the present age. Mede's standing as a careful scholar ensured that it was to have a profound effect on the religious life and outlook of the time and on the immediate course of English history over the next three decades. In addition to placing the millennium firmly in the future, thus opening the way for speculative interpretations and extreme millenarianism, Mede's exegetical scheme had at least two further consequences: it confirmed historicism as the fundamental principle of prophetic interpretation in English eschatological thought for several succeeding generations, and it unhesitatingly identified Rome as the Antichrist and the predicted latter-day apostasy. In an age which vividly remembered the Gunpowder Plot and its associated fears, Mede's considered and clearly articulated view of Rome as &#145;the unfaithful and treacherous spouse, the Christian Jezebel&#146;  (J. Mede, <span class="italic">The Apostasy of the Latter Times</span>, 1641) was staple diet for English minds which cherished protestantism and valued their religious freedom. Mede's work underpinned such intrinsic aspects of the religious outlook which prevailed in English post-Reformation thought for another 300 years or so.<br>
<br>Chronology and eschatology formed the basis for much of Mede's extensive correspondence, published in the later definitive editions of his works, edited by John Worthington (3rd edn, 1672; reprinted, 1677). Between 1626 and 1638 Mede's correspondents included Samuel Hartlib and John Durie, and his friends William Ames, professor of theology at Franeker in the Netherlands, and Sir William Boswell, ambassador to The Hague, each of whom was instrumental in bringing Mede and the <span class="italic">Clavis Apocalyptica</span> to the attention of potential readers abroad, and conveyed to Mede the comments and criticisms of some of his overseas readers. He also corresponded with James Ussher, William Twisse&#151;later prolocutor of the Westminster assembly, who provided the preface for <span class="italic">The Apostasy of the Latter Times</span>&#151;and Samuel Ward, master of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. Between 1620 and 1631 Mede also wrote regularly and at length to his friend Sir Martin Stuteville. This extensive series of letters, filling two folio volumes in the British Library (Harleian MSS 389 and 390), deals largely with current university issues and matters of local and public interest in England and abroad, throwing additional light on Mede as a man of his time, willing and able to comment on contemporary issues. The correspondence was brought to an end by Sir Martin's death in 1631.<br>
<br>Mede himself died prematurely, and in some discomfort, on 1 October 1638 at Christ's College, his death precipitated by the application of inappropriate medication which caused an internal blockage. His will, drawn up the day before his death, reveals that he was a man of only modest means, worth in all no more than &pound;500. He left &pound;100 to &#145;the master and fellows&#146; of Christ's College, &pound;100 to the poor of Cambridge, and, after various smaller bequests to his sister and her children, to the children of a deceased sister, and to a pupil, the residue of his estate to Christ's College, &#145;towards the adorning of the College Chapel&#146;, where he was buried on 2 October. A delayed memorial service was held at Great St Mary's in February 1639 at which the preacher was John Alsop, also a fellow of Christ's and Mede's executor. A monumental inscription to Mede in Christ's College chapel, preserved in Latin  (Mede, 35) and English, recalls his interest in philosophy, mathematics, chronology, history, and Near Eastern antiquities, and contains the words,<blockquote>He studied all languages, cultivated all the arts, &hellip; and above all things, theology, the queen of all sciences. &hellip; He was a bigot to no party, but loving truth and peace, he was just to all; candid to his friends, benignant to others: holy, chaste, and humble in his language, wishes, and habits. (Brook, 433)</blockquote>It remains a fitting tribute to one of the more notable English scholars of the seventeenth century.<br>
