<span class="headword">Revi&egrave;res <span class="st"> [Reviers, Redvers]</span>,  Baldwin  de</span>, earl of Devon  (<em>c.</em>1095&#150;1155), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of Richard de Revi&egrave;res and Adeliz, daughter of William Peverel of Nottingham. The family originated from Reviers (Calvados) but their estates, by the end of the eleventh century, centred on N&eacute;hou (Manche) and Vernon (Eure). Richard de Revi&egrave;res was a follower of William I's youngest son, Duke Henry, and when Henry became king in 1100, he rewarded Richard with the grant of extensive estates in Devon, Dorset, Hampshire, and the Isle of Wight, later known as the honours of Plympton, Christchurch, and Carisbrooke. Richard died in 1107 leaving his eldest son, Baldwin, probably little more than twelve years old.<br>
<br>Baldwin acted for Henry I as a minor local administrator in the 1120s and early 1130s, but emerged clearly at the beginning of Stephen's reign when, in the spring of 1136, he seized the royal castle at Exeter. The citizens appealed to the king for help and during the summer the castle was kept under close siege. Baldwin was not among the besieged, but nor was he at Plympton, the <i>caput</i> of his Devon estates; for the castle there was handed over to the king by the garrison which Baldwin had left to defend it. It seems he had withdrawn to his castle at Carisbrooke to organize a pirate fleet to prey on shipping running between Normandy and England. Following the fall of Exeter, Stephen moved quickly to Southampton, intending to invade the island. When the water supply in Carisbrooke Castle failed, Baldwin appeared before the king to plead for mercy and the restoration of his lands. Stephen was unmoved and Baldwin left the country soon afterwards, a landless exile. He took refuge at the court of Geoffrey, count of Anjou, and for the next three years was actively involved in the count's attacks on Normandy. In 1138 he was captured by the Norman baron Ingram de Say outside the castle of Isle Marie (Manche).<br>
<br>Baldwin must soon have regained his freedom as in July 1139 he led the Empress Matilda's invasion of England, landing at Wareham and seizing the nearby castle of Corfe. In the military campaigning of the next three years he remained a firm supporter of Matilda's cause. He fought in her army at the battle of Lincoln early in 1141 and was then among those who escorted her to London, where it was hoped she would be crowned. On her arrival there in midsummer she created him earl of Devon. He stayed with her during her retreat to Oxford and, in July 1141, when she moved her army to Winchester. But when Matilda's forces were routed in September, he may have left her entourage; in any event he is not again recorded in her company. In the late 1140s he may have gone on crusade, but he was at Westminster at the end of 1153 to witness the treaty between Stephen and Duke Henry, Matilda's son.<br>
<br>Baldwin was a prominent benefactor of religious houses. In the 1130s he founded a priory of Augustinian canons at Breamore, Hampshire, and a Cistercian abbey at Quarr, on the Isle of Wight. After becoming earl he established a priory on his manor of St James Church, to the south of Exeter, dependent on the monastery of St Martin-des-Champs, Paris, and gave leave for the abbey of Lyre to found a priory at Carisbrooke. He was a patron of Plympton Priory and of Christchurch Priory, Dorset, where he introduced regular canons.<br>
<br>Baldwin left at least five children from his first marriage, to Adeliz (parentage unknown). Adeliz died around 1146, and between 1151 and 1155 Baldwin married as his second wife, Lucy, the widow of Gilbert de Clare, earl of Hertford. He died on 4 June 1155 and was buried at Quarr Abbey. He was succeeded in his estates and the earldom by his eldest son, Richard. However, neither Richard nor his descendants achieved the prominence of the first earl. Three of the six earls who followed Baldwin either married or were betrothed to important heiresses, showing that they were regarded as potentially men of consequence, but a series of early deaths and often prolonged minorities reduced the family's influence, at court and also in south-west England, which was increasingly neglected in favour of the Isle of Wight. The seventh earl, named Baldwin like his great-great-grandfather, died without a male heir in 1262, when his estates and title passed to his sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47209/', "Isabella de Forz, countess of Aumale")</script>. She died in 1293, having outlived all her children. In 1335 the earldom of Devon was granted to Hugh Courtenay, lord of Okehampton, a descendant of Isabella's great-aunt Marion.<br>
