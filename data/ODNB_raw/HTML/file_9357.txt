<span class="headword">Ferrar,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1555), <span class="occ">bishop of St David's and protestant martyr</span>, was born at Ewood in Midgley in the parish of Halifax, Yorkshire. In the early 1520s he found a living at the Augustinian priory of St Oswald in Nostell, Yorkshire, where he was ordained an acolyte and subdeacon on 21 May 1524. On 24 September 1524 he was ordained a deacon at York, and was probably priested later at Cambridge. He was a student at Cambridge from 1524 to 1528 and at Oxford, where he graduated BTh on 14 October 1533, from 1528 to 1534&#150;5. At Oxford he fell under the influence of Thomas Garrett in 1528 and became one of a group of students engaged in selling protestant books, for which offence he was imprisoned twice. In 1535 he was invited by a fellow Augustinian, William Barlow, to join him in an embassy to James V of Scotland, and in 1536 Barlow obtained from Thomas Cromwell a general licence for Ferrar to preach. In June 1538 he was installed as the new prior of Nostell, worth &pound;600 a year. An ardent reformer, he preached extensively in the neighbourhood, but complained bitterly of the scarcity of preachers and schoolmasters there. To remedy this he proposed the conversion of his priory into a college of preachers but without success. In 1539 he surrendered his priory to the crown and was awarded a pension of &pound;80 a year. Between 1540 and 1547 he virtually drops from sight, although a lease dated 31 May 1545 shows that he engaged in commercial and agricultural activity in Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Following the accession of Edward VI, however, in August 1547 Ferrar was appointed a preacher to accompany the group of royal visitors entrusted with the visitation of the dioceses of Hereford and Worcester and the four Welsh ones. In the following year, when Barlow was translated from St David's to Bath and Wells, he recommended Ferrar as his successor in the former see. Since Ferrar was also chaplain and prot&eacute;g&eacute; to the duke of Somerset, he was duly appointed there in July 1548, the first bishop to be appointed by royal letters patent instead of being elected by the canons. His temporalities were restored on 31 July, and he was consecrated bishop on 9 September 1548 by Archbishop Cranmer and other bishops at the archbishop's house at Chertsey, the first bishop to be consecrated according to the rites of the new English ordinal. On 11 November he preached at Paul's Cross in markedly reforming vein and wearing only the vestments of a priest, giving scandal to the conservatively-minded. From then until March 1549 he was a regular attender at the House of Lords. At some time between 1547 and January 1549 he took a wife, whose name was Elizabeth. Three children were born to them: Samuel, Griffith, and Sage.<br>
<br>Later in 1549 Ferrar came down to his diocese for the first time. St David's had long been divided sharply by disputes between its previous bishop and his chapter, not only over doctrine but also over the rights that Barlow claimed over his chapter. These quarrels continued into Ferrar's episcopate, even though most of the chapter were no longer conservative in sympathy as they had earlier been. The leading figures among them were the precentor, Thomas Young, to be bishop of St David's (1560&#150;61) and archbishop of York (1561&#150;8), and Rowland Meyrick, later bishop of Bangor (1559&#150;66). George Constantine, registrar of St David's and friend of Ferrar since his Oxford days, was at first well disposed towards him but soon changed his stance. The first encounter between Ferrar's chancellor, Edmund Farley, and the chapter in April 1549 led to a serious disagreement, in the course of which the canons accused Farley of being guilty of <i>praemunire</i>. From then until 1553 relations between bishop and chapter remained extremely strained, though because of the confused state of the manuscript left by the chief authority for the events in question, John Foxe (BL, Harley MS 420), it is very difficult to trace clearly the course of these dissensions. What does emerge, however, is that both sides took advantage of every opportunity to thwart and annoy one another. Relations between Ferrar and Constantine deteriorated to such an extent that, for eighteen months, the diocese was virtually without a registrar until the council in the marches obliged Ferrar to return Constantine to that office.<br>
<br>During this time Ferrar was not only at loggerheads with many of his canons but also with a number of prominent laymen in his diocese, mainly over their respective rights to some of the more important temporal possessions of the see. In his attempts to make good some of the losses caused by his predecessor, Ferrar aroused fierce opposition from Bishop Barlow's eldest brother, Roger, from Dorothy, widow of Richard Devereux, and from Gruffydd Dwn, one of the most influential landowners in south Carmarthenshire, who was acting as Dorothy Devereux's attorney. Other powerful laymen opposed to him were Arnold Butler, William Owen of Henllys, and William Philips of Picton. A particularly serious dispute, which Ferrar seems to have lost, was one with Robert Birt of Llandygwydd.<br>
<br>In September 1550, tiring of what he considered to be obstructionism and neglect of duty by the precentor and canons, Ferrar took out a writ of <i>quo warranto</i> proceedings against them from the court of king's bench. In reply the canons submitted a series of fifty-six accusations against him, which were probably drawn up in the spring or summer of 1551. Although they were presented in the names of Thomas Lee, a Carmarthen merchant, and Hugh Rawlins, vicar of Tenby, neither Ferrar nor anyone else seems to have had any illusions concerning the real instigators. Ferrar protested with great bitterness that the complainants were the tools of the chapter and, in particular, of Young, Meyrick, and Constantine, &#145;his mortal enemies and the very devisers and procurers of the informations and bolsterers and bearers &hellip; hereof&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 7.17). The accusations were grouped under the five headings of abuse of authority, maintenance of superstition, covetousness, wilful negligence, and folly. Many of them were directed at least as much at his friends and servants as at Ferrar himself.<br>
<br>One of the consequences of these quarrels was their unfortunate effect upon worship and belief among the populace of the diocese. Clearly, there existed a small group of reformers who were keen to see protestant changes being pushed through. The altar at St Peter's Church, Carmarthen, was taken down at an early date, and the replacement communion table was moved several times thereafter. There were controversies about the maintenance of traditional practices at the time of communion services. Ferrar was criticized for his cautious attitudes in these matters, but ardent protestant though he was, he seems to have been hesitant, less from any sympathy towards Catholic usage than because he feared that rebellion and tumult might spread from Cornwall and Devon to his own diocese. Similarly, in spite of being an enthusiastic preacher, he admitted that he encountered difficulties because many of his congregations spoke only Welsh, but he claimed that he had preached frequently and with success in English-speaking towns like Carmarthen. He also confessed that he was sympathetic to Welsh speakers and the ancient prophecies cherished by them.<br>
<br>Between January and April Ferrar again attended parliament, but was forbidden to leave London until July. He was not, however, imprisoned during Edward VI's reign, as has often been claimed. He remained at liberty in St David's diocese and even continued to exercise his episcopal functions after the accession of Mary I in July 1553. He appears to have remained in his diocese until as late as September of that year. He was then summoned to London and imprisoned, along with other protestants, probably in the queen's bench prison at Southwark. There he seems to have been humanely treated. On 4 March 1554 steps were taken to ensure that every married bishop was deprived of his diocese and on 13 March 1554 a further commission was issued for the deprivation of Ferrar and three other bishops. A successor to him, Henry Morgan, a canon lawyer of Llandaff diocese, was quickly elected on 28 March, but it was not until 22 January 1555 that Ferrar appeared before Bishop Gardiner to answer for his reforming opinions. He was then sent to Wales where, on 20 February 1554, he was arraigned at Carmarthen before his successor, Henry Morgan, and his former registrar, Constantine, to answer whether or not he believed in the lawfulness of clerical matrimony and the validity of transubstantiation. He was examined again on 7 March, when he refused to subscribe to articles described by him as devised and drawn up by men. At last, on 13 March, after he had appealed in vain from Morgan to Archbishop Pole, the final sentence was passed on him. On 30 March 1555 he was burnt at the stake &#145;on the south side of the market cross&#146; at the town of Carmarthen, according to Foxe. He endured his sufferings with great courage. All his former antagonists, except Rowland Meyrick, were said to have been reconciled to him. He is commemorated with a plaque in St Peter's Church and a tablet in Nott Square on the reputed site of his burning.<br>
