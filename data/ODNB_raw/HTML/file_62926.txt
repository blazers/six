<span class="headword">Corkery,  Daniel</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Lee]</span>  (1878&#150;1964), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist and writer</span>, was born at 1 Gardiner's Hill, Cork city on 14 February 1878, the son of William Corkery (<i>d</i>. 1883), a carpenter whose family had lived in Cork city for several generations, and Mary Barron (<i>d</i>. 1923), the daughter of a Waterford sea captain, who kept a small shop after her husband's death. Corkery suffered from a bone deformity which left one leg shorter than the other. Corkery was educated by the Presentation Brothers at their South Monastery School, won a King's scholarship, and trained as a pupil teacher; he became a full-time teacher in 1905 and underwent a year's training at St Patrick's College, Drumcondra, in 1906&#150;7.<br>
<br>Corkery developed an interest in the Gaelic League in 1901 under the influence of D. P. Moran's weekly paper <span class="italic">The Leader</span>. (He had previously been only vaguely aware of the existence of an Irish language.) Between 1901 and 1910 Corkery wrote regularly for <span class="italic">The Leader</span> under the pen-name Lee, with the aim of improving Irish artistic standards and giving Cork a civic culture drawing on the everyday life of the city and the Gaelic traditions of the surrounding countryside. He also taught primary classes in St Francis' national school in the city centre (1905&#150;13) and St Patrick's national school on the North Side (1913&#150;18), both in slum areas. He complained about teaching overcrowded classes of poor children in an examination-oriented system which gave little time for encouraging individual creativity, and tried to encourage team sports, gave drawing lessons, and formed a school choir. His pupils included the future sculptor Seamus Murphy and Michael O'Donovan (Frank O'Connor).<br>
<br>In 1908 Corkery became the leading figure of the Cork Dramatic Society, an amateur group intended as a Cork counterpart to the Abbey. Between 1909 and 1913 it produced eighteen original plays (including five by Corkery). Despite its eventual demise it marked the beginning of Cork's Little Theatre tradition. At this time Corkery was primarily a cultural nationalist who saw separatism as impracticable; he argued the subject with Terence MacSwiney, whom he had met through the Gaelic League. Although they admired each other's dedication and intellectual ambitions, they also disagreed about the possibility of Irish culture expressing itself through English as well as Irish (MacSwiney thought this impossible) and the plays of J. M. Synge, which Corkery publicly defended.<br>
<br>Corkery had begun to publish short stories in magazines; in 1916 some were collected as <span class="italic">A Munster Twilight</span>. This and the publication of his novel <span class="italic">The Threshold of Quiet</span> the following year established his literary reputation. At the same time he was moving towards Sinn F&eacute;in; this led to his being refused the headmastership of his school in 1918, and he resigned to become a travelling instructor with the co. Cork technical instruction committee. In 1918 he was offered a Sinn F&eacute;in parliamentary candidacy.<br>
<br>Corkery was deeply affected by the sense of cultural and national revival of the War of Independence period (1919&#150;21), in particular by the death on hunger strike of MacSwiney as lord mayor of Cork which attracted worldwide attention. His response to this period is expressed in his second short-story collection, <span class="italic">The Hounds of Banba</span> (1920), and <span class="italic">The Labour Leader</span> (1920), a play loosely based on the activities of James Larkin, whom he greatly admired. He also wrote at this time <span class="italic">Three Plays</span> (1920; a play about the Easter Rising, which was excluded by military censors and published in 1942) and a book of verses, <span class="italic">Ui bhreasail</span> (1921). He hoped to found a school of local writers incorporating some of his younger associates, notably O'Connor and Sean O Faolain.<br>
<br>Corkery opposed the Anglo-Irish treaty of 1922 as a betrayal of the ideals of the rising and supported the defeated republicans in the ensuing civil war. In 1924 he published his best-known book, <span class="italic">The Hidden Ireland</span>. This study of the Gaelic poetry of eighteenth-century Munster has been criticized for romanticizing its subject and ignoring the extent to which the poets it described spoke for a class of strong farmers with aristocratic pretensions rather than the Irish-speaking people as a whole, but its evocation of cultural loss, and its insistence on the impossibility of understanding Ireland without knowledge of Gaelic culture, made it an inspiration to many later Irish artists and intellectuals.<br>
<br>The appearance of <span class="italic">The Hidden Ireland</span> strengthened Corkery's literary reputation (further increased by his third and strongest short-story collection, <span class="italic">The Stormy Hills</span> (1929)) and opened a breach with his disciples O'Connor and O Faolain, who disliked his calls for the subordination of individuality to an idealized national tradition. This was exacerbated by Corkery's attacks on Sean O'Casey and Liam O'Flaherty for what he saw as vulgarity and cynical hostility to the idealism of the War of Independence period, and by his publication of <span class="italic">Synge and Anglo-Irish Literature</span> (1931), a partial retraction of his earlier praise of Synge, which although often narrow and incoherent, raises important questions about Irish literature in English. Its insistence on the link between Catholicism and Irishness was particularly controversial. (Corkery idealized the culture of medieval Catholic Europe, but his own religious beliefs are the subject of some controversy. Some friends believed he was a secret agnostic; he certainly had a strong anti-clerical streak, usually confined to private conversation.) By 1931 Corkery had decided it was impossible to have a distinctive Irish culture in English, since it would be distorted by the dominance of the English literary market. This led him to devalue most Irish literature in English, including his own (though he published one further short-story collection, <span class="italic">Earth out of Earth</span> (1939)). He later published some small works outlining his views on the revival of the Irish language, and a play in Irish, <span class="italic">An doras dunta</span>.<br>
<br>Corkery was appointed professor of English in University College, Cork, in 1931 after a bitter contest with O Faolain, and held the position until 1947. He was awarded a DLitt in 1948, served in the Irish Senate, 1951&#150;4, and sat on the Irish Arts Council, 1952&#150;6. He continued to produce journalism, and was recognized as a significant influence by many Irish artists and a major presence in the intellectual life of Cork (where he continued to encourage local talent). The Irish-language poet Sean O Riordain, who had an ambivalent relationship with him, said that he towered over the intellectual life of Cork like a mountain. He painted extensively in watercolours all his life, and attained a minor reputation for the handling of colour in his late work, most of which is in private ownership.<br>
<br>Corkery never married; his unmarried sister Mary kept house for him. Towards the end of their lives, as they grew increasingly frail (Corkery became almost blind some time before his death) they spent the winter months with their niece in Passage West, co. Cork, where Corkery died suddenly of a heart attack on 31 December 1964. He was buried in January 1965 at St Joseph's cemetery, Cork city.<br>
<br>Daniel Corkery's critical views remain controversial. Some critics see him as a cultural commissar embodying the narrowness of de Valera's Ireland, others praise him as a pioneering post-colonial critic. Through his role as developer of others' talents and popularizer of Gaelic culture, as well as his own limited but distinctive literary output, he secured a lasting place in Irish cultural history.<br>
