<span class="headword">Holman,  Joseph George</span>  (1764&#150;1817), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, born in August 1764, was the son of John Major Holman of the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields, Middlesex, an officer in the British army, who died when his son was two years old. He was sent by his uncle to Dr Barwis's school in Soho Square, where annual theatrical productions were popular. He matriculated on 7 February 1783 at the Queen's College, Oxford, but took no degree. On 26 October 1784, at Covent Garden, he made his first appearance on the stage, as Romeo. An occasional address, the opening lines of which were<blockquote>
<div>From Isis' banks just wing'd his daring flight<br>
</div>
<div>A College Soph presents himself to-night,<br>
</div>
</blockquote>was spoken by Thomas Hull, who played Friar Lawrence. Holman performed a number of other leading roles in his first season, including Richard III, Hamlet, and Lothario. His original characters during his first spell at Covent Garden included Harry Thunder in John O'Keeffe's <span class="italic">Wild Oats</span> (16 April 1791). At the end of his third season Holman left Covent Garden owing to a dispute over salary, and acted in Dublin and in the principal English and Scottish towns; but he soon returned to his former theatre.<br>
<br>In the season of 1799&#150;1800 a serious quarrel took place between the proprietors of Covent Garden and eight of the principal actors. A pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">A statement of the differences subsisting between the proprietors and performers of the Theatre-Royal, Covent-Garden &hellip;</span> was published in 1800, and went through several editions. The authorship of the pamphlet, which printed correspondence and memoranda between the proprietors and the actors, was attributed to Holman. The grievances of the actors were submitted to the lord chamberlain, the marquess of Salisbury, whose verdict went against them. Some newspaper correspondence and disturbance in theatrical circles followed. Seven actors accepted the decision and remained at Covent Garden, but Holman either resigned or was dismissed. He appeared a few times at the Haymarket, where he produced his <span class="italic">What a Blunder</span>, a comic opera in three acts, in which he acted Count Alphonso d'Esparza. He then went to Dublin, where he had sufficient success to take for a time a share with Frederick Edward Jones in the management of Crow Street Theatre. After a while, however, he resigned, and took up farming. On 31 July 1806 he played in Dublin for his benefit Antony in Dryden's <span class="italic">All for Love</span>. On 22 August 1812 he reappeared at the Haymarket, after eleven years' absence, and played a few parts.<br>
<br>In 1798 Holman had married Jane, the youngest daughter of the Hon. and Revd Frederick Hamilton; she died on 11 June 1810. No mention of a previous marriage is traceable, but, when Holman went to America in 1812 he took with him a daughter old enough to play Lady Townly in Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Provoked Husband</span> in New York to his Lord Townly; she supported him throughout his American career. In a letter of introduction he took out he was erroneously described as a fellow of Queen's College. In 1813 Holman and his daughter performed at the Chestnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia. He undertook the management of the Walnut Street Theatre in that city, but was unsuccessful. In 1815 he managed a theatre in Charleston. In 1817 he married a Miss Lattimer, a singer &#145;of great talent and distinguished beauty and merit&#146;; she afterwards married C. W. Sandford, and died in 1859. Holman himself died, probably of apoplexy, at Rockaway on Long Island, New York, on 24 August 1817.<br>
<br>Several of Holman's theatrical works were performed; the earliest, the comic opera <span class="italic">Abroad and at Home</span>, was among the best known. His reputation as an actor was established when he was a young man, and remained high throughout his lifetime. W. C. Macready, in his <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, described him as &#145;remarkably handsome, though inclined to obesity, his tendency to which he endeavoured to combat by a chicken diet&#146;  (1.58).<br>
