<span class="headword">Burrell family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1800&#150;1929), <span class="occ">agricultural machinery manufacturers</span>, came to prominence with three brothers who were partners in a small engineering business at Thetford in Norfolk. These were Joseph Burrell, William Burrell (1766&#150;1832), and James Burrell (1770&#150;1837).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_75523"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Burrell</span>  (1759&#150;1831)<span class="occ"></span> is generally regarded as the founder of the firm, and he was certainly in business on his own account by about 1790, repairing agricultural implements. Within a few years he was beginning to make implements as well. He first attracted notice in 1803 when, at the annual Holkham sheep shearing, he exhibited a seed and manure drill of his own design. The following year he filed a patent for an improved threshing machine, and in 1805 he showed a mowing machine at Holkham. On these foundations the business run by the three Burrell brothers was able to develop. James Burrell managed the business alone after his two elder brothers died, and on his death in 1837 control passed to his second son, aged only twenty. This was <a name="cosubject_46795"></a><span class="headword">Charles Burrell</span>  (1817&#150;1906)<span class="occ"></span>, who was to play a key role in the transformation of the firm. He changed the name of the business to Charles Burrell, engineers and agricultural machinists, and later to Charles Burrell &amp; Sons.<br>
<br>Charles Burrell had an engineer's mind that was inventive and ready to explore new ideas. His was one of the earliest firms to make portable steam engines, the first device being made in 1846, and in 1848 he produced the first threshing machine that also dressed the grain. This type of combined threshing and dressing machine soon became the standard in farming, except where the smallest machines were required.<br>
<br>In the 1850s Burrell concentrated his technical abilities on the development of self-moving steam engines. In particular he collaborated with James Boydell, patentee of an &#145;endless railway&#146; mechanism. This consisted of a series of flat feet attached to the outside of the engine's wheels. They were hinged in such a way that as the wheel revolved each succeeding foot would lie flat in contact with the ground, thus spreading the weight of the engine. The idea was that this arrangement would be more efficient for road-haulage engines, enabling them to deal with poor road surfaces. Burrell became the licensed manufacturer of Boydell engines in 1855, and from 1856 to 1862 he made several types of machine for use on the roads and for ploughing by direct traction.<br>
<br>Boydell engines proved to be unsuccessful, both technically and commercially, and Burrell turned instead to the development of conventional wheeled traction engines. In this he had considerable achievements, and his firm came to be known mainly for its traction engines and road locomotives. In the 1870s he worked with R. W. Thompson in the production of his road steamers&#151;steam tractors designed to haul passenger and goods vehicles on the roads. A number of these were built for export. Burrell improved and adapted the design.<br>
<br>In 1846 Charles Burrell married Elizabeth Cowen (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1895), daughter of Robert Cowen, owner of Beck Foundry, Nottingham. The couple had five sons and two daughters. Charles Burrell served on Thetford council's navigation committee for the River Ouse. He was a justice of the peace for the county, appointed in 1877. In 1884 the family business was incorporated as Charles Burrell &amp; Sons Ltd. Charles Burrell remained as chairman, though by now he was not so actively engaged in day-to-day management. In 1904 he retired completely. He died at Thetford on 28 June 1906.<br>
<br>Burrell was succeeded as chairman of the company in 1904 by his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_59145"></a><span class="headword">Charles Burrell</span>  (1847&#150;1929)<span class="occ"></span>, one of three sons who entered actively into the business in the 1870s. The younger Charles went to Thetford grammar school, and received some technical education at King's College, London. After initial training in the firm he became a general manager, steadily taking over more and more responsibility from his father. Under his leadership the firm grew from about 200 employees in 1870 to 400 in 1913, comfortably the largest employer in Thetford. Charles Burrell was a highly regarded local figure and, like his father, was engaged in the civic life of Thetford. He was elected to the council in 1874 and served continuously for the fifty-five years until his death, in later years as an alderman. He was mayor seven times, and was a justice of the peace for the borough and the county. He was a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and of the council of the Smithfield Club from 1916 to 1925. He was married twice, in 1873 to Sarah Annie Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1910) and in 1912 to Annie Phillis Wilberforce (who survived her husband). He died at Thetford on 12 November 1929.<br>
<br>His younger brother <a name="cosubject_59146"></a><span class="headword">Robert George Burrell</span>  (1849&#150;1904)<span class="occ"></span> was sales director for the family firm and travelled extensively throughout Europe and Russia between 1875 and the 1890s, when heart disease began to restrict his activities. He was also active in the town, and was elected to the borough council in 1882. Robert Burrell served as mayor for three years consecutively (1888&#150;91) and became an alderman in 1901. He was a justice of the peace for the borough, and a major in the Norfolk Volunteers. He was president of the local Conservative association from 1885 to 1898, and his involvement in local charities included the governorship of Thetford School and the hospital foundation. In 1882 he married Ellen Alborough Cockayne (who survived her husband). Robert Burrell died from a heart attack on 7 September 1904.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_59147"></a><span class="headword">Frederick John Burrell</span>  (1855&#150;1927)<span class="occ"></span> was the third son of Charles Burrell the elder to become active in the firm, and he was the one who inherited the family's technical genius to fullest measure. Most of the technical developments and soundness of the engineering of Burrell products in the 1880s and 1890s were due to him. His inventiveness was not confined to his own firm's products. Among the patents registered in Frederick's name were those for a machine for freezing ice cream, a bacon-slicing machine, and burglar-proof fasteners for sash windows. He was a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. He had an unhappy marriage, and from the late 1890s his health deteriorated. His involvement with the management of the firm ceased about 1900, and he died of pneumonia on 15 October 1927, at St Andrew's Hospital, Thorpe, Norfolk.<br>
<br>From modest beginnings as a country firm repairing agricultural implements, Charles Burrell &amp; Sons Ltd had, by the end of the nineteenth century, become an important manufacturer of agricultural machinery. The steam engines developed by Charles and his sons were well known throughout Europe, and their traction engines and road locomotives were especially popular with travelling showmen. However, Burrells remained a modest enterprise compared with such competitors as Aveling and Porter Ltd and John Fowler &amp; Co. (Leeds) Ltd; and the retirement of Charles Burrell the younger, soon after the end of the First World War, led to the firm's being taken over by Agricultural and General Engineers Ltd.<br>
