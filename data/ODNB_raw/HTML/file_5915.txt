<span class="headword">Collier, Sir  George</span>  (1738&#150;1795), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in London on 11 May 1738, the son of George Collier. He was promoted lieutenant on 3 July 1754 and served on the home station, and under Sir George Pocock in the East Indies. Having been made commander on 6 August 1761, he was posted to the <i>Boulogne</i> frigate on 12 July 1762, and commanded her until the peace in the following year. On 3 September 1763 he married Christiana, daughter of Richard Gwyn of Middleton Hall, Carmarthen; they had one son. He was then appointed to the <i>Edgar</i>, guardship at Plymouth, which he commanded for three years; and afterwards to the frigates <i>Tweed</i>, <i>Levant</i>, and <i>Flora</i>. During his stay on shore prior to the American War of Independence he adapted for the stage a version of &#145;Beauty and the Beast&#146; under the title <span class="italic">Selima and Azor</span>. Collier's production was the work of a man of refined taste with a passion for literature, and it was well-received at the Drury Lane Theatre in 1776.<br>
<br>In the previous year Collier seems to have been sent to North America on some special service, the circumstances of which are not known, but for which he received a knighthood on 27 January 1775. He was then appointed to the <i>Rainbow</i> (44 guns), in which he sailed for America on 20 May 1776. Shortly after his arrival on the station he was charged by Lord Howe with the duties of senior officer at Halifax, and on 17 June 1777 he received the thanks of the assembly of Nova Scotia for his defence of the province. On 8 July 1777, after a long chase, he captured the <i>Hancock</i>, a large frigate which the American revolutionaries had recently built and commissioned, and which was added to the British navy as the <i>Iris</i>. In the following month, on intelligence of an imminent invasion of Nova Scotia, Collier burnt the magazines and stores at Machias, where the American invasion force was gathering and, proceeding along the coast, destroyed some thirty assembled vessels. For this well-timed service he was again officially thanked by the governor and council of the colony on 24 August 1777.<br>
<br>Collier continued in this command until February 1779, when, by the recall of Rear-Admiral James Gambier, the command of the station temporarily devolved on him. He was summoned to New York, and hoisted his broad pennant in the <i>Raisonnable</i> (64 guns). The strength of the squadron was then severely depleted by the redeployment of all the ships of force in the West Indies. Nevertheless Collier immediately proposed to Sir Henry Clinton, military commander-in-chief, a joint expedition to the Chesapeake, which accordingly got under way, Clinton supplying 2000 men under the command of General Matthews. On 9 May the squadron anchored in Hampton Roads, and over the next fortnight it destroyed or captured 137 vessels (including ships of war built or building, privateers, and merchant ships). Within twenty-four days the squadron was back at New York, having destroyed stores valued at an estimated &pound;1 million or more. Collier later co-operated with Clinton in expeditions up North River and along the coast of Connecticut, and burnt a great number of boats and small vessels.<br>
<br>In early July 1779 Collier received news that a settlement lately established in Penobscot Bay was under attack by sea and land. He immediately proceeded there, with a force of four frigates and the 64-gun ship, but Collier's ships were obliged to anchor for the night at the mouth of the bay, and the Americans used the delay to re-embark their troops and the greater part of their stores. The next day, as the British squadron advanced, the American forces fled up the river, and, being closely pursued, set fire to and destroyed four of their own ships; four more armed vessels fell into Collier's hands. On his return to New York, Collier found that Vice-Admiral Marriot Arbuthnot had come out to assume the command. Collier could not have expected to retain his position but his correspondence indicates he was aggrieved at being superseded by the less able Arbuthnot after his own brilliant defence of Penobscot. Collier returned home in the <i>Daphne</i> frigate, arriving at Portsmouth on 27 November 1779. He kept a journal of his part in the American War of Independence, which he subsequently prepared for publication as &#145;A detail of some particular services&#146;  (NMM, JOD/9 and BGR/28) and later printed in the <span class="italic">Naval Chronicle</span>  (32, 267&#150;96, 353&#150;83). This followed a similar record of his visit to Paris and Brussels in 1773, later published as <span class="italic">France on the Eve of the Revolution</span> (1865).<br>
<br>Early in 1780 Collier was appointed to the <i>Canada</i> (74 guns), which he commanded in the channel during the summer of 1780, and at the relief of Gibraltar by Vice-Admiral George Darby in the spring of 1781. On the homeward voyage he chased and came up with the Spanish frigate <i>Leocadia</i> (44 guns), which he took after a short though spirited resistance. Collier had been divorced from his first wife, Christiana, in March 1772, and on 19 July 1781 he married Elizabeth, daughter of William Fryer, an Exeter merchant; they had four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Owing, it is said, to some discontent with the government, or dissatisfaction with Lord Sandwich, then first lord of the Admiralty, Collier resigned his command on his return to England. There is nothing to suggest that Collier was personally at odds with Sandwich, and his decision may have been prompted by a failed bid for patronage. In 1784 he was returned to parliament as member for Honiton. After his return from America in 1779 he had incurred displeasure in the Commons by expressing the belief that the war could not be won by the means and men employed. During Pitt's ministry he similarly earned no favours for his opposition to the government's attempt to limit the powers of the regent in 1786. It was Collier's belief that his defence of the prince of Wales cost him his flag. He had no further naval employment until 1790, by which time he had ceased to represent Honiton. In the crisis following the Spanish action at Nootka Sound he was appointed to the <i>St George</i>, but he considered himself insulted by an order to prepare her to receive a flag officer, in light of his previous service as an independent commander. With the approval of his brother officers he wrote to the Admiralty, and the order was revoked. The <i>St George</i> was paid off when the threat of war receded, but after its return he was promoted rear-admiral of the white on 1 February 1793, and advanced to vice-admiral of the blue on 4 July 1794. In the following January he was appointed to the command-in-chief at the Nore, but by then his health would no longer support the burden, and he was compelled to resign the position a few weeks later. &#145;In person&#146;, it was noted in the <span class="italic">Naval Chronicle</span>, &#145;Sir George was of a middle stature; active, and well made. His countenance was open and manly&#151;his eye blue, and beaming with intelligence; his hair light, and complexion fair&#146;  (<span class="italic">Naval Chronicle</span>, 32, 265). Collier:<blockquote>was an enemy to the mode of manning the navy by impressment. He conceived it perfectly practicable to attract all the youthful mariners on our coasts, by a wise and liberal system of reward and promotion; in which case he thought the use of the lash might safely be abolished&#151;cases of theft only excepted. (ibid.)</blockquote>His life during the last fifteen years was embittered by a feeling that his really distinguished service in America, during the few months of his independent command, had not received due recognition. He died in Manchester Square, London, on 6 April 1795.<br>
<br>All four sons from Collier's second marriage served in the armed forces. George, the eldest, reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Coldstream Guards, and died of wounds received at Bayonne on 10 May 1814. The second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5914/', "Francis Augustus Collier")</script>, entered the navy and served under Schomberg, and Nelson, and died a rear-admiral in 1849. Henry Browne Collier passed through all the ranks of the navy, latterly as a &#145;yellowed&#146; flag officer, and died in 1872. The fourth son, Charles, had an army career, serving in the cavalry in Bengal. His two daughters were Louisa and Georgina.<br>
