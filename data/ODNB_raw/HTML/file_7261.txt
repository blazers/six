<span class="headword">Davies,  Rowland</span>  (1649&#150;1721), <span class="occ">dean of Cork</span>, was born at Gille Abbey, near Cork, the son of Rowland Davies, a customs officer of Bandon, co. Cork, and Mary Smith (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Scudamore). He was descended from an ancient Herefordshire family and, having received his early education in Cork under Mr Scragg, he entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 23 February 1665; he graduated BA in 1671, and proceeded MA in 1681 and LLD in 1706. Initially he planned to enter the medical profession but on 9 April 1671 priest's orders were conferred upon him, and on 11 May he was admitted to the prebend of Kilnaglory, in the diocese of Cork. He was collated on 26 October 1673, and in 1676 granted the prebend of Iniscarra, in the diocese of Cloyne. In 1674 he exchanged his prebend of Kilnaglory for that of Iniskenny, in the same diocese; and he was instituted on 10 February 1679 to the deanery of Ross by the archbishop of Cashel. To these benefices was added the prebend of Liscleary, in the diocese of Cork, on 20 October 1679. He composed a detailed manuscript &#145;Account of the state of the diocese of Cork in 1682&#146;. In 1674 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1715), daughter of Captain Robert Stannard and granddaughter of Archbishop Boyle of Armagh, lord chancellor of Ireland.<br>
<br>Dreading the arrival of James II in Ireland, Davies left Cork in company with many others in March 1689, and sought employment in the ministry in England. Initially he was curate of Camberwell, Surrey, of which his fellow countryman Dr Richard Parr was vicar. Though he applied repeatedly for livings he was disappointed, but at Camberwell he faithfully discharged the duties of his profession. In July 1689, through the interest of friends, he was appointed by the corporation of Great Yarmouth to a lectureship there, which, however, in a few months he resigned.<br>
<br>When William III sailed for Ireland Davies obtained an appointment as chaplain to one of his regiments, and he landed again in his native country on 11 May 1690. His arrival at Belfast and the active part he took at the battle of the Boyne, the siege of Limerick, and generally through the whole Irish campaign, are particularly recorded in his journal. He was, with many more, attainted by King James, but after the close of the war he regained his preferments. In 1693 he became vicar-general of Cloyne, an office for which from his knowledge of canon law he was well qualified. In 1695 the county of Cork publicly acknowledged his &#145;great services against the torys&#146;  (Bishop Downes's manuscripts, TCD). In 1707 he became precentor of Cork and, resigning the deanery of Ross in 1710, he succeeded to that of Cork, on the death of Dean Pomeroy, by patent dated 17 February. In the same year he was also presented to the rectory of Carrigaline, near Cork, which he resigned in 1717.<br>
<br>Davies died at Dawstown, co. Cork, on 11 December 1721, and was buried in the family vault in Cork Cathedral, where there is an inscription to his memory and to those of three descendants. A fine portrait of him in his doctor's gown, and some of his manuscripts, were in the possession of his descendants in 1857. With his wife, who predeceased him on 28 February 1715, he had four sons who reached manhood, besides other sons who died young, and several daughters. One of his sons was preferred to the archdeaconry of Cloyne in 1742.<br>
