<span class="headword">Knyvet, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1485&#150;1512), <span class="occ">courtier and sea captain</span>, was the eldest son of Edmund Knyvet of Hilborough, Norfolk (<i>d</i>. 1503/4), himself the eldest son of Sir William Knyvet of Buckenham, Norfolk (<i>c</i>.1448&#150;1515). Thomas's mother was Edmund's wife, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. after 1540), daughter of William Tyrell of Gipping. He came to notice at court towards the end of Henry VII's reign, jousting in the tournaments of May and June 1507 and serving as an esquire for the king's body. He was closely attached to the Howard family from the time of his marriage, by 9 July 1506, to Muriel (<i>d</i>. 1512), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13939/', "Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey and later second duke of Norfolk (1443&#150;1524)")</script>, and his first wife, Elizabeth Tilney (<i>d</i>. 1497), and widow of John Grey, Viscount Lisle (<i>d</i>. 1504). From 1509 he emerged as one of the favourites of Henry VIII, taking a leading part in many tournaments and revels at court. The king made him knight of the Bath at his coronation on 23 June 1509 and appointed him bearer of the king's standard on 27 July 1509 and master of the horse on 22 February 1510. He was also rewarded with local offices on the crown lands, customs licences, and a lease of those Lisle estates not already allocated to his wife in dower. Muriel served as a lady-in-waiting to Queen Katherine, and their links with the queen were presumably reflected in the names of two of their children, Katherine and Ferdinand; another, Anne, would serve the queen in the 1520s and receive a dowry from her mistress.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war with France in 1512 Knyvet was given command of the <i>Regent</i>, one of the two largest ships in the fleet led by his brother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13891/', "Sir Edward Howard")</script>. On 10 August, in an engagement outside Brest, the <i>Regent</i> grappled and boarded the <i>Cordeli&egrave;re</i>, the largest ship in the French fleet. The <i>Cordeli&egrave;re</i> caught fire and both ships burnt, killing some 600 or 700 men on the <i>Regent</i> and 900 or more on her opponent. Sir Thomas, who according to one report was killed by gunfire before the conflagration, was among the dead. Sir Edward Howard vowed to avenge Knyvet's death before he saw the king again, and was killed in the attempt in April 1513. Knyvet's widow died in childbirth between 13 and 21 December 1512, leaving their three sons and two daughters to be brought up by their grandmother, Eleanor Knyvet. The eldest son, Edmund (1508&#150;1551), eventually succeeded to most of his great-grandfather's estates, while his brother Henry (<i>d</i>. 1546) became a gentleman of Henry VIII's privy chamber. Four of Sir Thomas's five brothers also served the king at court or in the navy. Sir Thomas Knyvet's portrait, which does not survive, was painted by the Venetian artist Antonio da Solario, and he was commemorated in a poem by John Leland; his fatal encounter with the French inspired a poetic exchange between Thomas More and Germain de Brie.<br>
