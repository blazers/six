<span class="headword">Steuart, Sir  Henry Seton</span>, first baronet  (1759&#150;1836), <span class="occ">landowner and agriculturist</span>, born on 20 October 1759, was the second but eldest surviving son of James Steuart (<i>b</i>. 1715), tenth of Allanton, Lanarkshire, an agriculturist and scholar. His mother, Margaret, was a daughter of Henry Steuart Barclay of Collernie, Fife. The family claimed descent from Sir John Steuart of Bonkill, lord high steward of Scotland, who was killed at Falkirk in 1298, and whose sixth son, Sir Robert of Daldowie, was asserted to have been the progenitor of the Stewarts of Lennox, Darnley, and Castlemilk. Sir Henry Steuart supported this contentious pedigree in the face of considerable opposition.<br>
<br>Steuart completed his education at Hamburg, and returned to Scotland when about seventeen. In 1778 he entered the army as a cornet in the 13th light dragoons. Three years later he exchanged into the 10th light dragoons, and accompanied to Ireland his kinsman General Sir James Steuart of Coltness as aide-de-camp. In 1787 he retired from the army, and married Lilias (<i>d</i>. 1835), daughter and heir of Hugh Seton of Touch-Seton, Stirlingshire. Of their two daughters, only one, Elizabeth Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1790), survived infancy and succeeded to her mother's estates. She married Reginald Macdonald of Staffa<a href="#cosubject_26419"> [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Steuart settled at Allanton, dallied with literary pursuits, and energetically set about the improvement of his estate, engaging Thomas White the elder between 1788 and 1805 to lay out his park. His winters he usually spent among Edinburgh society.<br>
<br>In 1801 Steuart published a pamphlet advocating the construction of a canal from the Lanarkshire coalfields to Edinburgh in order to cheapen and improve the coal supply of that city, and proposed supplying Ireland, the Isle of Man, and even some foreign ports with fuel from the same district. In 1806 he published a competent edition of Sallust's works for which he was awarded the degree of LLD from Edinburgh University, and was also elected FRSE. He occasionally contributed to the <span class="italic">Anti-Jacobin</span> and other periodicals, and at his death left in manuscript fragments of a &#145;History of the rebellion of 1745&#146; and of a history of Scotland. He handed over to Chambers the materials he had collected for a history of the rebellion. He was created a baronet of Great Britain in 1815.<br>
<br>Owing to bad health Steuart abandoned most of his literary work, and arboriculture became the chief interest of his life. In September 1823 a deputation from the Highland and Agricultural Society, which included Sir Walter Scott and lords Belhaven and Corehouse, visited Allanton, and reported on the improvements effected there by Steuart's system of transplanting large trees: his success lay in his earlier design of a device&#151;a wheeled cradle&#151;in which the tree and its root-ball could be supported and transported without damage. Though Steuart had had to contend with an unfavourable soil and an exposed position, Scott reported that &#145;he exercises wonderful power, certainly over the vegetable world, and has made his trees dance about as merrily as ever did Orpheus&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 8.91). In fact Scott disliked Steuart, &#145;the knight of Allanton&#146;, whose advice he was obliged to seek for his Abbotsford estate. Steuart extended and replanted his own estates. His scheme was unremarkable but impressed Cobbet when he arrived in 1832. About 1826 Steuart gave courses in tree-planting and would send his own workmen to other estates. He also managed Touch, the Stirlingshire estate of his absentee brother-in-law.<br>
<br>Largely from his own experience, Steuart wrote his <span class="italic">Planter's guide, or, A practical essay on the best method of giving immediate effect to wood by the removal of large trees and underwood</span> (1828); Scott reviewed it enthusiastically but anonymously in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> and it was favourably received elsewhere. Reprinted in 1828, a New York edition of 1832 had a large circulation in America. However Steuart's claims to have sought to apply the principles of physiology to practical arboriculture, and to have created the new science of phytology, were disputed, although his method was followed with success on estates in Ireland and England. A posthumous edition of the <span class="italic">Planter's Guide</span>, with additional material compiled before Steuart's death, was issued in 1848, with dedication to Queen Victoria. Steuart died on 11 March 1836, and was buried in the family vault at Camnethan, Lanarkshire.<br>
<br>Steuart's son-in-law, <a name="cosubject_26419"></a><span class="headword">Sir Reginald Macdonald  Steuart-Seton</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Reginald Macdonald]</span>, second baronet  (1778&#150;1838)<span class="occ"></span>, assumed the name of Steuart, and subsequently that of Steuart-Seton, when he succeeded to the baronetcy. He was a friend of Scott, was sheriff of Stirlingshire for twenty-six years, and for thirty-nine acted as ruling elder of the presbytery of Moll in the general assembly. He was also for many years secretary of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland. He died in Edinburgh, aged sixty, on 15 April 1838, leaving three sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Sir Henry James Macdonald Steuart-Seton (1812&#150;1884), succeeded to the baronetcy.<br>
