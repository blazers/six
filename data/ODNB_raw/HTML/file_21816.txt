<span class="headword">Pelly, Sir  Lewis</span>  (1825&#150;1892), <span class="occ">army and political officer in India</span>, was born at Hyde House, Minchinhampton, Stroud, Gloucestershire, on 14 November 1825, the youngest son of John Hinde Pelly (1786&#150;1852) of Bristol and the Bombay civil service, and his wife, Elizabeth Lewis (1781/2&#150;1852) of Brinscombe, Gloucestershire. His five brothers all had careers in India; he also had four sisters. He was educated at Rugby School, and in 1841 joined the East India Company's Bombay army as an ensign. He became lieutenant (1843), captain (1856), major (1861), lieutenant-colonel (1863), colonel (1871), major-general (1882), and lieutenant-general (1887). Early in his career he was seconded to the foreign department, and served in what came to be known as the Indian political service and was the machinery of British indirect rule over the princely states.<br>
<br>In 1851&#150;2 Pelly was assistant to the British resident at the princely court of Baroda, and prosecuted the corruption (<i>khutpat</i>) inquiries before James Outram's commission. From 1852 to 1856 he was employed in a civil capacity in Sind, and in 1857 acted as aide-de-camp to General John Jacob, who was commanding the cavalry division of the Indian army in the Persian War (1856&#150;7). In the following year he returned to Sind, where he joined Jacob again as brigade major of the irregular horse Sind frontier force. Pelly collected and published <span class="italic">Views and Opinions of General Jacob</span> on the reorganization of the Indian army, which reached a second edition in 1858.<br>
<br>In 1859 Pelly was appointed secretary of legation and subsequently charg&eacute; d'affaires at Tehran. He was inexperienced in the politics of the Persian Gulf and compromised the British government in discussions over the Persian claim to Bahrain, but was not reprimanded. He also came into conflict with J. Felix Jones, the British resident in the Persian Gulf. He returned to India in 1861, making the journey of 800 miles from Herat to Kandahar on horseback and without an escort. He spent a few months in Calcutta with Lord Canning, the viceroy, before joining a roving commission in east Africa; he was shipwrecked on the Comores archipelago in September 1861. At the end of that year he became political agent and consul at Zanzibar, where he confirmed earlier treaties with the sultan. In 1862 he replaced Jones as resident in the Persian Gulf, through the patronage of Sir Bartle Frere, by then governor of Bombay, and the official to whom the resident was answerable. A historian of the Persian Gulf observed that &#145;While Frere remained Governor of Bombay little that Pelly did was permitted to be criticized &hellip; However foolish Pelly's actions might be, Frere never failed to shield him from censure and rebuke&#146;  (Kelly, 575).<br>
<br>The nine years of Pelly's residency were marked &#145;not only by indecorous quarrels with other political officers, but also by ill-judged or inept acts of policy&#146;  (Kelly, 575), with long-term consequences for British involvement in the region. For example, when he was asked to mediate between the Wahabis under the leadership of the amir, Faisal, and Thuwaini, sultan of Muscat (through whose territory an important telegraph cable was to run), Pelly initially declined to become involved, but changed his mind and travelled to the interior to visit Faisal at Riyadh in February 1865. (He published both an official account and an article in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</span> describing his experiences there.) He was persuaded by his reception that Thuwaini should be supported against the threats of Faisal, particularly as Faisal appeared to be resisting British views on the slave trade in the gulf. His intervention served only to make the relationship between Faisal and Thuwaini worse, and the British sent gunboats to bombard Faisal into submission. When the bombardment failed (and despite news of Faisal's own, unrelated, death), Pelly bombarded the Wahabi adherents at Sur, in an alternative demonstration of British strength; in the meantime, Thuwaini was murdered by his son. Rash and even incompetent as Pelly's actions had been, he was sheltered by the support of Frere against the wrath of the viceroy of India, Lord Lawrence, who advised that Britain interfere henceforth as little as possible with the Arabs, whether on the coast or inland. He further entangled the British government in the affairs of Oman and Muscat during negotiations over the telegraph and attempts to suppress slavery in the gulf, and his vigorous but ill-informed support for various Arab leaders ultimately committed Britain to the financial and political support of particular rulers in the region. Excessively influenced in his advice to government by personal feelings towards his informants, whether British or Arabs, he was patently unsuited to the sensitivities of British interests in the gulf. He was nevertheless appointed CSI in 1868 and remained in post until 1873, when he joined Frere's anti-slavery mission to Zanzibar.<br>
<br>Later in 1873 Pelly returned to India, where he was appointed agent and chief commissioner to the states of Rajputana. He was appointed KCSI in May 1874, and later that year he was sent as special commissioner to Baroda, where the British resident, Colonel Robert Phayre, had apparently been poisoned. It was suggested that the Maharaja Gaikwar of Baroda himself had been responsible for the offence, owing to political differences with the resident. Pelly arrived in Baroda in November 1874, and in January 1875 arrested the Gaikwar, Malhar Rao, and had him tried by a special commission. Although the Gaikwar's guilt was not proved, the British government deposed him none the less, on grounds of incapacity to rule, and appointed a successor. Pelly's last important appointment in India was as envoy-extraordinary and plenipotentiary for Afghan affairs at Peshawar in 1877, where he held inconclusive talks with an Afghan representative, before being recalled in March; the Second Afghan War broke out the following year. In August 1877 he retired, was created KCB, and returned to England.<br>
<br>On 1 August 1878 Pelly married Amy Henrietta, only surviving daughter of the Revd John Lowder, British chaplain at Shanghai, and stepdaughter of Sir Rutherford Alcock; they had no children. He was offered, and declined, charge of the Congo Free State by the king of the Belgians in 1883, and spent the early years of his retirement assisting the Royal Geographic and Asiatic societies. He published <span class="italic">The Miracle Play of Hasan and Husain: Collected from Oral Tradition</span> in two volumes in 1879. In 1885 he was elected Conservative MP for North Hackney, was re-elected the following year, and continued to represent that constituency until his death. He rarely spoke in the House of Commons, confining himself largely to Indian affairs. He died at Rosemullion, Falmouth, Cornwall, on 22 April 1892; he was promoted full general the same day. A short, well-built man, he had his portrait painted by Louise Starr Canziani, and a portrait of Lady Pelly by the same artist was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1884.<br>
<br>Pelly's elder brother, <a name="cosubject_21817"></a><span class="headword">Saville Marriott Pelly</span>  (1818&#150;1895)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 28 March 1818 and educated at Winchester College and Guy's Hospital, London, before joining the Indian Medical Service. He accompanied the Sind irregular horse during Sir Charles Napier's campaigns (1844&#150;7), and subsequently on the Sind frontier under General John Jacob (with whom his brother was also serving). He served with the second regiment of light cavalry in Rajputana during the mutiny campaigns of 1857&#150;8. He was principal medical officer of the Indian medical department throughout the Abyssinian campaign of 1867&#150;8 under Lord Napier of Magdala, was appointed CB, and retired as inspector-general of hospitals in the Bombay presidency in 1870. He died at Woodstock Villa, Burnt Ash Hill, Lee, Kent, on 3 April 1895, leaving a widow, Jane Billing, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Morris, whom he had married in 1850, and two sons and two daughters.<br>
