<span class="headword">Clarke,  William John Turner</span>  (1805&#150;1874), <span class="occ">pastoralist and financier in Australia</span>, was born on 20 April 1805 at Bridgwater, Somerset, second son of William Clarke (<i>c</i>.1770&#150;1813), Aldgate livestock dealer, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Turner (<i>d</i>. 1819), of Weston Royland, Somerset. At Barnstaple grammar school from 1811 to 1818, he was noted for mental arithmetic and a clear hand. Hindered in games, although not riding, by a malformed hip, he spent his leisure shrewdly observing the local docks. After his widowed mother died in January 1819, he went to live at his uncle Joseph's farm at Wiveliscombe, from where he drove cattle to London, where a cousin was a butcher. Accumulating skill and savings, augmented by a bequest, he began his own stock business in 1826 at Hambridge, Somerset. In May 1829 he eloped with Elizabeth, or Eliza (1801&#150;1878), eldest daughter of the Revd George Pyke Dowling, rector of nearby Puckington, and the two embarked in July 1829 for Van Diemen's Land, taking livestock and capital totalling about &pound;2000.<br>
<br>In Van Diemen's Land from 1830, Victoria from 1837, South Australia from 1862, and New Zealand from 1871, Clarke acquired enormous leasehold pastoral estates, as well as 215,000 acres of freehold, with 62,000 acres at Sunbury, Victoria, obtained by a not unusual piece of sharp practice. Nicknamed Money or Big Clarke, he managed his lands astutely, and was in addition a director of the Colonial Bank from 1862. He had interests in other financial institutions and lent money at interest on his own account. He was a Victorian legislative councillor from August 1856 to 1870, except for seventeen months from February 1861 while he was in England.<br>
<br>From 1833, Clarke's wife and three sons lived at Timsbury House, Hobart, while he made the rounds of his estates. He often lived at Melbourne's Port Phillip Club Hotel which suited his plain taste and Eliza's wish to keep her distance after her sister Jane (1816?&#150;1894) had become pregnant by Clarke in Hobart in 1838. Employees and the wider family, including Clarke's sister, brother, and their families, who returned with him from England in 1841, maintained their genuine regard.<br>
<br>Tall and consumptively lean in youth, with reddish hair, Clarke was described by William Kelly in 1853 as &#145;big and burly, with bushy eyebrows &hellip; small, retired, twinkling eye &hellip; and a snub nose&#146;. A short black pipe, cigars, and English cider were indulgences, but he often appeared drab or dirty &#145;without waistcoat, gloves or other expletives of dress&#146;.<br>
<br>Jane Dowling returned to Melbourne about 1853 with her and Clarke's daughter Oceana, having left her husband, Denis Maloney, whom she had married in Sydney in 1847. With Clarke she had two more children. Clarke openly provided for the family which included a son William (1854&#150;1940) who achieved prominence in labour politics from 1904. Clarke was finally estranged from Eliza in 1858 and lived with Jane from 1867, but moved to Roseneath, Essendon, in mid-1870 to allow recovery from a stroke. However, he died there on 13 January 1874, eight months after another attack, and was buried on 16 January in the Melbourne general cemetery. His estate, which was valued at between &pound;3 million, and &pound;4 million, went chiefly to his sons, in particular, the eldest of the three sons born to him and Eliza, <a name="cosubject_52443"></a><span class="headword">Sir William John Clarke</span>, first baronet  (1831&#150;1897), <span class="occ">landowner and philanthropist</span>, who was born on 31 March 1831 at his father's estate of Lovely Banks, near Oatlands, Van Diemen's Land. He was educated at Hobart academies until 1846, then at Whitchurch grammar school in Shropshire from 1847 to 1850 and returned to Tasmania in October 1850. He worked on his father's estates in Victoria and then joined his brother Joseph at the Norton Mandeville estate in Tasmania until his marriage on 23 August 1860 to Mary (1835&#150;1871), daughter of Hobart merchant John Walker (1799&#150;1874) and Janet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Glass.<br>
<br>In Melbourne, Clarke oversaw the estate administration office his father had established. From about 1865 the family home was a wooden bungalow on the Sunbury estate. His wife died there on 14 May 1871, following a carriage accident. Two sons and two daughters were left in the care of their governess, <a href="#cosubject_52444">Janet Snodgrass [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who married Clarke on 21 January 1873. They had four sons and four daughters, one dying in infancy. The year after his marriage, Clarke's father's death made him the largest landowner in the colony, and he proceeded to spend his money lavishly. A &#145;very liberal landlord&#146;  (<span class="italic">Australasian Sketcher</span>, 13 May 1876), he promoted scientific farming and stock breeding, sports (including coursing), and the volunteer militia. Encouraged by his second wife to enter public life, he was unchallenged as a Victorian legislative councillor after election in September 1878. Sir George Bowen put forward his name for a baronetcy as &#145;the most generally esteemed Colonist&#146; in November 1878. This, the first Australian baronetcy, was bestowed personally in November 1882, when Clarke was in England. The designated seat was Rupertswood, Sunbury, the mansion he had built between 1874 and 1879.<br>
<br>Clarke was a noted philanthropist and gave large sums to institutions including Melbourne Church of England Cathedral and Melbourne University. He was president of Melbourne's International Exhibitions of 1880&#150;81 and 1888&#150;9, and Victorian commissioner at the Indian and Colonial Exhibition of 1886. An enthusiastic freemason, he became first grand master of the newly united lodge of Victoria in 1889. He inherited his father's large shareholding in the Colonial Bank and was its governor from 1877. His personal funds bolstered it during financial crises in 1893 and 1895. The Rupertswood battery of horse artillery, founded on 30 December 1884 in protest at the lack of colonial defence, and maintained at his expense, afforded some of his greatest pleasures.<br>
<br>Clarke's sudden death on 15 May 1897 in Collins Street, Melbourne, was attributed to heart and kidney disease, perhaps exacerbated by personal losses in the 1895 financial crisis. His funeral in Melbourne Cathedral was one of largest ever seen in the colony, and he was buried on 18 May at Melbourne general cemetery. His estate, later valued at over &pound;1 million, was shared among his widow and ten surviving children.<br>
<br>Clarke's widow, <a name="cosubject_52444"></a><span class="headword">Janet Marion Clarke <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Snodgrass]</span></span>, Lady Clarke  (1851&#150;1909), <span class="occ">charity administrator</span>, was born on 4 June 1851 at Doogalook, Goulburn River, Victoria, second child of pastoralist Peter Snodgrass and Charlotte Agnes, daughter of squatter and pioneer John Cotton. She was educated privately and became the Clarkes' governess after her father's death in 1867 left the family impoverished. Her acuity and flair in society, public causes, and as estate trustee were acclaimed. Janet Clarke Hall at Melbourne University recognizes her gift to build Australia's first university women's college. In poor health after malarial fever in 1903, she died on 28 April 1909 at her home, Cliveden, East Melbourne, and was buried on 29 April beside her husband in Melbourne general cemetery.<br>
