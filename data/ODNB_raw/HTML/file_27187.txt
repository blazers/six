<span class="headword">Thirning,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1413), <span class="occ">justice</span>, probably came from Thirning in Huntingdonshire, where his name occurs in connection with the manor of Hemingford Grey. Thirning served on various commissions before becoming a serjeant in 1383. In 1377 he was on the commission of peace for the county of Northampton, and on 20 December of that year was a commissioner of oyer and terminer in Bedfordshire. In June 1380 he was a justice of assize for the counties of York, Northumberland, Cumberland, and Westmorland. He was appointed a king's serjeant in 1388, and a justice of the common pleas on 11 April of the same year; he became chief justice of that court on 15 January 1396. In 1392 he was one of the commissioners appointed by the king to inquire into the shortcomings of the government of the city of London. In the parliament of January 1398, when the judges were asked for their opinions on the answers for which their predecessors had been condemned in 1388, Thirning replied that declaration of treason not yet declared was a matter for parliament, but that had he been a lord of parliament, if he had been asked, he would have replied in the same manner.<br>
<br>Thirning's attitude on this occasion did not prevent him from taking a leading part in the process of deposing Richard II in 1399. He was one of the persons appointed to obtain Richard's renunciation of the throne on 29 September, and was one of the commissioners who on the following day pronounced the sentence of deposition in parliament. According to Walsingham, Thirning advised Henry of Lancaster to abandon his idea of claiming the throne by right of conquest, the chief justice arguing that such a claim would have made all tenure of property insecure. Although doubt has been thrown on the composition of the delegation, it seems almost certain that Thirning was one of those sent to interview Richard in the Tower of London on 29 September and obtain his renunciation of the throne; and after the estates had pronounced sentence of deposition on 30 September Thirning was one of the commissioners sent the following day to announce the sentence to Richard. According to Walsingham, when the sentence was read Richard refused to renounce the spiritual honour of king. Thirning then reminded him of the terms in which on 29 September he had confessed that he was deposed on account of his demerits. Richard demurred, saying it was simply that his government had not been acceptable to the people. Thirning, however, insisted, and Richard only smiled and asked to be treated honourably. On 3 November Thirning pronounced the judgment of the king and peers against the accusers of Thomas, duke of Gloucester. The leniency of the judgment, according to Walsingham, caused some ill feeling among the people.<br>
<br>Thirning continued to be chief justice throughout the reign of Henry IV, and was reappointed on the accession of Henry V in 1413. He must have died very soon after, for his successor, Richard Norton (<i>d</i>. 1420), was appointed on 26 June of the same year, and in Trinity term of that year Thirning's widow, Joan, brought an action of debt.<br>
