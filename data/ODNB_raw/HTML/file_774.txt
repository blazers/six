<span class="headword">Ashton,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1653&#150;1691), <span class="occ">official in the royal household and Jacobite conspirator</span>, was the son of Andrew Ashton (<i>d</i>. 1679), of Liverpool, and his wife, Alice. His father was apparently a parliamentarian army officer, though from the royalist family of Ashton of Penketh, near Warrington, Lancashire&#151;one brother was killed and another heavily fined on the cavalier side. John Ashton's marriage licence of 15 December 1685 described him as being about thirty-two, and in January 1691 he declared that he had served James II for sixteen years. He should not therefore, be confused with Colonel Edmund Assheton or Ashton of Chaderton, a courtier in James's service since the 1660s. John Ashton had joined the &#145;family&#146; of Major-General Robert Werden, comptroller of James's household from 1675, and was for years secretary to his son Sir John Werden, James's private secretary from 1673. In 1684 Ashton was clerk to the commissioners of James's household; in 1687, following Werden (who still considered him his own servant) into the queen's household, he was clerk to her council. She respected his diligence, loyalty, and financial honesty, and his determined Anglicanism did not forfeit her or James's favour.<br>
<br>On 17 December 1685 at St Mary-at-Hill, Lovat Lane, London, Ashton married Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1667, <i>d</i>. 1693), daughter of Edward Rigby, a leading mercer (later of Covent Garden) from another Lancashire gentry family ruined by civil-war royalism. Their first son, John, baptized on 29 June 1686, and two siblings (one posthumous), died as infants, but a son, James, and a daughter named after her godmother the queen survived. Ashton traded privately and ran lotteries in Scotland. He bought a small Essex estate for &pound;1500 but his home was in London&#151;possibly, after 1688, at Mr Rigby's. His friends included William Cartwright, bishop of Chester.<br>
<br>Late in 1688 Ashton lent James's government &pound;12,500, perhaps really the queen's money. He may also have been the &#145;John Ashton, gent.&#146; who lent William III's government &pound;4000 in 1689. He was sometimes known as Captain or Major Ashton, though no army commission is recorded. After the revolution of 1688, using his partial immunity as a royal servant, he acted for the Jacobite cause. He advanced money towards paying Mary of Modena's debts to tradesmen, and tried to save Lord Melfort's art collection. The queen's debts and Robert Werden's accounts were the cover for Ashton's last mission. In May 1689 he crossed unannounced to St Germain carrying letters for Mary. Back in England that winter he was trusted to disburse Jacobite money: he sent 1100 guineas by the marquess of Atholl to Scotland to finance Sir James Montgomery's plot. In May 1690 he and some Jacobite officers were captured at Dover trying to cross to France, but were soon bailed.<br>
<br>Ashton that winter planned to exacerbate disillusionment with William III by republishing the king's largely unfulfilled declaration of 1688. He also supported the plan to send Richard Graham, Viscount Preston, to St Germain to resume his post as James's secretary of state, and was praised for his zeal and sincerity in the Jacobite cause by William Penn, the Quaker. The appearance of more witnesses alleging that the prince of Wales was supposititious made Ashton decide to cross to France with Preston, carrying long-assembled proofs of the prince's legitimacy, to gain James's permission to publish them and lay them before parliament. He hired a smack and late on 31 December 1690 Preston, Ashton, and Edmund Elliot, a naval captain dismissed for Jacobitism, sailed down the Thames.<br>
<br>William's government, however, discovered the plan, and a naval captain who boarded the smack at Tilbury the next day found the three men hiding in the ballast. Ashton picked up and concealed the packet of treasonable letters Preston had left there, evidently hoping to throw it overboard, but was spotted, and the packet was seized. He and the others vainly urged the captain to destroy it or flee with them.<br>
<br>Swiftly brought before the next Old Bailey sessions for high treason, Preston and Ashton, who insisted on separate trials, were given little time to prepare their defence. Ashton was tried on 19 January 1691 before a clearly biased jury. Lord Chief Justice Holt took care that Ashton's deafness should not hamper his defence, but Holt's colleague Pollexfen showed violent hostility throughout. Ashton's witnesses were nonjuring clerics who testified as to his protestantism. He was found guilty; but the prosecution's failure, apparently from sheer incompetence, to prove his knowledge of the treasonable documents by identifying his handwriting there enabled him to consider himself legally innocent.<br>
<br>Queen Mary II accepted the verdict and ignored heavy pressure from many sides to pardon or reprieve Ashton. He himself considered that it was his papers on the prince of Wales, seized with him and permanently suppressed, which doomed him. Surviving ministers' letters stress rather that his death might frighten Preston into confessing what he knew of this dangerous conspiracy. The cruder parts of the death sentence were remitted. On 28 January 1691 Ashton was driven to Tyburn by coach. He behaved with fortitude and, after praying with two nonjuring clerics, was hanged. He was buried that night at St Faith's under St Paul's Church. At his trial and in his last paper, he emphasized Elliot's ignorance of the plot, and the latter was soon freed. Ashton's paper, besides criticizing his trial, stressed the duty he felt as an Anglican to serve James, and his certainty of the prince's legitimacy. Published in mid-March it made a great impression, was translated into Dutch and French, and prompted a pamphlet war between government and Jacobite sympathizers. Ashton became known as &#145;a royal martyr&#146; or &#145;the loyal martyr&#146; (<span class="italic">Life and Times of Anthony Wood</span>, 3.353; Grascome). Early disparagement by James's extremist Catholic ministers fell silent.<br>
<br>Late in 1692 Mary Ashton crossed to St Germain with her son, to whom King James gave a baronetcy and pension, but died about February 1693. Macky's allegation in <span class="italic">A View of the Court of St Germain</span> that she was refused favour for not being a Catholic and died broken-hearted is contradicted by a report to Archbishop Sancroft that she died unharried by proselytizing, with Anglican divines attending. Her daughter claimed, moreover, that James defied French law and had her buried with Anglican rites. Her son died before September 1698. Ashton's daughter married Richard Venn, a leading London cleric.<br>
