<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mayerl,  William Joseph <span class="st"> [Billy]</span></span>  (1902&#150;1959), <span class="occ">pianist and composer</span>, was born on 31 May 1902 at 53 Tottenham Court Road, London, the second of three children of Joseph Mayerl (1871&#150;1937), violinist, and his wife, Elise (1881&#150;1938), daughter of Adam August Umbach, a clarinettist from Holland. His paternal grandfather was Anton Mayerl, probably from Bohemia. There were professional musicians on both sides of Mayerl's family but his only formal study was on a scholarship in the junior department at Trinity College of Music, London, from 1911 to 1914. He was a child prodigy, apparently playing Grieg's piano concerto in the Queen's Hall at the age of nine. But before he had finished even these minimal studies he was employed in cinemas, in the days of silent films, billed as the &#145;Wonder boy pianist&#146;. He was fascinated by American popular music, learning the tunes from the mechanical penny-in-the-slot machines. In 1919 Mayerl became a published composer but, in spite of his own energetic promotion, he was mortified when his <span class="italic">Egyptian Suite</span> was not a success. But success was to come. He graduated from cinemas to playing in dance bands. It was probably in 1921 that he was heard in Southampton by the American saxophonist and bandleader Bert Ralton, who was building up a band at the Savoy Hotel in London, and made him an immediate offer. The Savoy Havana and the Savoy Orpheans became the most famous of all dance bands through their regular appearances on BBC radio in the earliest days of broadcasting. As pianist in the Savoy Havana, Mayerl was in a unique position to present his own dazzling piano playing, including his compositions such as <span class="italic">The Jazz Master</span>, <span class="italic">The Jazz Mistress</span>, and <span class="italic">Jazzaristrix</span>. These titles suggested jazz but the genre was novelty piano since Mayerl was never an improvising player. His effortless high-speed playing caused him to be known as &#145;the pianist with the lightning fingers&#146; and he was filmed in slow motion to try to see how it was done. Mayerl was an admirer of George Gershwin and gave the first British public performance of <span class="italic">Rhapsody in Blue</span> at the Queen's Hall on 28 October 1925.<br>
<br>On 19 April 1923 Mayerl married a fellow cinema pianist, Ermenegilda 
    (Gilda, Gil, and later Jill; 1896&#150;1984)
  , daughter of Isidoro Bernini, a tailor, who had come to this country from Italy as a child. There were no children. This was a particularly happy marriage and it gave Mayerl the stability to launch into three simultaneous careers when he left the Savoy in 1926. He became a celebrity on the music halls; he worked in the musical theatre; and, along with the businessman novelist Geoffrey Clayton, he started the Billy Mayerl School of Music, where the teaching was done by post supported by 78 r.p.m. recordings. Between the wars syncopated piano playing was all the rage and both amateurs and professionals wanted to learn how to update their style. The Billy Mayerl School had thirteen branches in England and five abroad; it issued the <span class="italic">Billy Mayerl Club Magazine</span> every month from 1934 until the war, and the club enrolled almost 2000 members. Mayerl had some famous pupils and the prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) was a fan who used to enjoy accompanying him on drums. In the theatre Mayerl's first full-length show was <span class="italic">Nippy</span>, about a waitress in a caf&eacute; which belonged to the popular chain of Lyons Corner Houses. The title role was taken by the glamorous Binnie Hale and the show contained &#145;A couple of fine old schools&#146;, which turned out to be a song about Eton College and Borstal prison. Throughout the 1930s, with extraordinary energy, Mayerl composed and conducted musical comedies designed as vehicles for some of the most celebrated actors of the period, went on broadcasting regularly, and appeared on the early pre-war television broadcasts. When the war came this world collapsed. Mayerl's school went into liquidation and, turned down for active service, he took a routine job directing the band at the Grosvenor House Hotel on Park Lane. Increasingly Mayerl felt at home in the field of British light music, helping to start the Light Music Society in 1957 and editing its magazine until his death.<br>
<br>Mayerl's stunning pianism is preserved in many recordings, but he left a unique body of piano music, consisting of some 300 piano solos and more than 100 transcriptions of popular songs. Mayerl encapsulated the mood of the 1920s perfectly in his <span class="italic">Six Pianolettes</span> and <span class="italic">Four Piano Exaggerations</span> which demand a virtuosity few pianists have been able to match. In the 1930s the <span class="italic">Four Aces Suite</span> and the <span class="italic">Aquarium Suite</span> reflected two of his enthusiasms&#151;playing cards and fish&#151;and Mayerl also developed what he called syncopated impressions. He was a keen gardener so these lyrical pieces often had floral titles. For millions his name has always been synonymous with one of these in particular&#151;Marigold (which he used as the name of his house). But he also thought of himself as a more serious composer in orchestral works such as <span class="italic">Sennen Cove</span> and <span class="italic">The Forgotten Forest</span>. By the 1990s, thanks to Eric Parkin's series of recordings and reissues of Mayerl himself, his attractive music was being recognized in a category somewhere between classical music and jazz. Mayerl enjoyed his friends and his success but his later years were dogged by ill health exacerbated by overwork since early youth. A heavy smoker, he died of coronary thrombosis and arteriosclerosis at Marigold Lodge, Pyebush Lane, Beaconsfield, on 25 March 1959, and was cremated at Golders Green on 31 March.<br>
