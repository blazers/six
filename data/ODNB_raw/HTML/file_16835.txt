<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Hannibal Evans</span>  (1770&#150;1847), <span class="occ">philologist and translator</span>, was born in London on 30 May 1770, and was baptized at St Mary Marylebone on the day of his birth, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16836/', "Henry Humphrey Evans Lloyd (c.1718&#150;1783)")</script> and his wife, Mary, the sister of the Chevalier James de Johnstone. His parents died in his youth, but he was carefully brought up by some near relations, and thrived on a strict programme of studies and activities. He had an extraordinary memory, and was a lover not only of the arts, but of mathematics and science. He visited Europe, and in the spring of 1800 settled at Hamburg. He suffered severely from the hardships that Hamburg endured during its occupation by the French army, and joined the inhabitants in taking up arms in its defence. He eventually escaped, but lost most of his property. On his arrival in England in July 1813 he published, at the suggestion of Lord Bathurst, the foreign secretary, a volume based on his experiences, entitled <span class="italic">Hamburgh, or, A particular account of the transactions which took place in that city during the first six months of 1813</span>. About the same time he received an appointment in the Foreign Office, the duties of which had previously been divided among several clerks, but Lloyd's competence in continental languages enabled him to discharge them single-handed. He retained the post until his death. Lloyd married Lucy Anna Margaretta Von Schwartzkopff (1782/3&#150;1855) of Hamburg, with whom he had a son and four daughters, including Elizabeth [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58700/', "Thompson, Elizabeth Maria Bowen")</script>]. A friend of Klopstock, Lloyd translated under his auspices a large part of <span class="italic">The Messiah</span>, but did not publish his version. His excellent memory and varied acquirements made him a delightful companion. He wrote elegant Italian verse and corresponded with many eminent travellers and men of science.<br>
<br>Throughout his career in the Foreign Office Lloyd continued to produce many works of a varied nature. He enjoyed biography and historical works, and, capitalizing on his knowledge of European countries, published such works as <span class="italic">Alexander I, Emperor of Russia</span> (1826), and <span class="italic">Descriptive and Historical Illustrations</span>, in English and French, accompanying J. Coney's <span class="italic">Architectural Beauties of Continental Europe</span> (1831&#150;4). Lloyd's linguistic studies were also important: his <span class="italic">Theoretisch-praktische englische Sprachlehre f&uuml;r Deutsche</span> (1828) ran to four editions, and was long the standard grammar in several German universities. In 1829 he edited a German&#150;English dictionary, and edited or revised several such works during his lifetime. Chief among his own great number of translations are many works of travel literature rendered into English, including Saabye's <span class="italic">Greenland</span> (1818), Prince Wied-Neuwied's <span class="italic">Travels in Brazil</span> (1820), Von Kotzebue's <span class="italic">Voyage of Discovery into the South Sea and Beerings Straits</span> (1821), Timkovsky's <span class="italic">Travels of the Russian Mission through Mongolia to China</span> (1827), Wolff and Doering's <span class="italic">German Tourist</span> (1837), Count Bjornstjerna's <span class="italic">British Empire in the East</span> (1840), Prince Wied-Neuwied's <span class="italic">Travels in the Interior of North America</span> (1843), and Tam's <span class="italic">Visit to the Portuguese Possessions in South-Western Africa</span> (1845).<br>
<br>Lloyd was a constant contributor to the <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span> from its commencement in 1817, chiefly on foreign archaeology and the fine arts. During the last sixteen months of his life he suffered repeated attacks of &#145;congestion of the brain&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>); he died at Morden College, St German's Place, Blackheath, Kent, on 14 July 1847, and was buried in the cemetery of Morden College, where his widow was also later buried. His eldest daughter, Susette, had married Henry William Smith, treasurer of Morden College, in 1836; she and her sisters were supporters of the college and of missionary work in Syria and Lebanon.<br>
