<span class="headword">Kidd,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1645&#150;1701), <span class="occ">pirate and privateer</span>, was a Scot, by tradition born in Greenock, Renfrewshire, into the family of a Church of Scotland minister; however, the names of his parents are not known and his date of birth is derived from his age, about fifty-six, when he died. He does not appear in the historical record until 1689 when he was a member of a pirate crew brought into service by Christopher Codrington, governor of the Leeward Islands, as privateers in his struggle against the French in the West Indies during the Williamite wars. Kidd was made captain of the <i>Blessed William</i> and saw action on the island of Marie Galante and in the relief of St Martin. His men disliked such service and stole the ship, leaving for New York city, a known pirate haunt. They had also stolen Kidd's booty, worth &pound;2000, so he determined to follow them&#151;in the event fruitlessly&#151;in a ship presented to him by Governor Codrington.<br>
<br>Kidd arrived in New York in time to join the royal forces sent out to suppress the rebellion of Jacob Leisler. Siding with the forces reimposing authority both brought Kidd into favour with the new regime and into friendship with important politicians in the colony, especially his fellow Scot the merchant and landowner Robert Livingston. He decided to settle in New York, marrying, by licence dated 16 May 1691, the twice widowed Sarah Oort 
    (formerly Cox, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bradley; <i>d</i>. 1744)
  , who brought property from her prior marriages and with whom he had two daughters. Until 1695 Kidd remained in New York city, occasionally serving as a privateer while making friends among the merchants and politicians. Eventually he tired of this life and he and Livingston concocted a plot to take advantage of Kidd's special skills. Both men appeared in London in 1695 where Livingston approached Richard Coote, earl of Bellomont, the newly appointed governor of New York and Massachusetts Bay, with a plan. The scheme he presented was that Kidd would sail to the Indian Ocean, where pirates had been wreaking havoc. On arrival he planned to capture the pirates and their treasure and return to Massachusetts Bay or England, where the pirates would be tried, their treasure condemned, and the profits divided among the investors. To obtain the necessary documents and funding Bellomont approached his patrons the whig lords who formed the junto administration in London; after listening to the proposal and meeting Kidd they agreed to fund the scheme and obtain the necessary commissions. Kidd, Livingston, and Bellomont were the openly acknowledged investors and the hidden partners were the earls of Shrewsbury, Orford, and Romney and John Lord Somers. Kidd left England with a more powerful ship, the <i>Adventure Galley</i>, with commissions to hunt down pirates, attack French commerce, and keep the cargoes he captured free of interference by the owners, an exceptional combination of privileges made possible only through the intervention of his patrons. By April 1696 he had left London and was preparing to sail to New York to obtain more crewmen and to inform his family of his new venture.<br>
<br>Once in New York Kidd recruited ninety men, many of whom were experienced pirates. They left on 6 September 1696 and arrived at Tulear, Madagascar, in January 1697. Given that Madagascar was the main base of the pirates in the Indian Ocean Kidd's actions to this point seem normal, but he quickly drew suspicion on his motives when he sailed to the Red Sea, where he attacked the pilgrim fleet. These ships were <i>en route</i> for India loaded with cargo and pilgrims returning from Mecca. The most likely explanation for his action is that he may have believed that he could raid the fleet and sail away without leaving a trace and then return with his booty claiming it was seized from pirate ships. Much to his surprise the East India Company vessel <i>The Sceptre</i> was sailing with the fleet and it aggressively defended the ships. Kidd then sailed for the west coast of India where he unsuccessfully attacked a number of trading vessels. The men, who were on a &#145;no prey, no pay&#146; contract, were increasingly unhappy and tensions increased until during an altercation Kidd killed his gunner, William Moore, striking his head with a wooden bucket hooped with iron. After this Kidd's luck changed and he captured six ships, of which only two, carrying French passes, could be considered legitimate prey under his commission. Having done enough the <i>Adventure Galley</i>, by now in poor condition, sailed for the pirate base of Ste Marie, just off the coast of Madagascar.<br>
<br>Once there, Kidd openly consorted with the pirates he had been sent out to capture. His ship sank in the harbour at Ste Marie and he proceeded home in one of his captured vessels, the <i>Quedah Merchant</i>. Most of the original crew remained on the island to better their fortunes. Meanwhile the East India Company, punished by the Mughal government for the actions of the pirates, raised a campaign in England against the pirates and against Kidd in particular: so much so that by 1698 he was a marked man and orders were shortly sent to Bellomont to seize Kidd.<br>
<br>Kidd's first landfall was the Danish island of St Thomas where he discovered that he was an outlaw and that his patrons were out of power. Prior to sailing to New York he stopped on Hispaniola, where he sold much of his cargo to merchants from Cura&ccedil;ao and purchased a smaller ship, the <i>San Antonio</i>. Moving toward New York he continued to offload crew and cargo when convenient and acquire intelligence about his status. When near New York he hovered off the coast, meeting his friends such as Livingston, who could provide him with little comfort. The key to his future was Bellomont, who was now in Boston. The two exchanged messages while Kidd disposed of valuables, leaving enough on board to tempt Bellomont to make a deal of some sort to secure his freedom. Bellomont listened to Kidd's entreaties but he could not in the end ignore royal orders; he had Kidd arrested and sent to England along with as much of his cargo and fortune as he could seize.<br>
<br>In England Kidd was approached by the tories, who were now in power, to testify against his patrons the whig lords. Kidd refused to play their game, perhaps because he felt that only the whigs could save him now. However, the whigs, now facing charges of treason, were happy to let matters proceed against Kidd in order to get him out of the way. His trial conformed to contemporary practice in the high court of Admiralty which offered the defendant little protection. The one unusual feature was that the French passes he seized from two of the vessels he captured and which were returned to England with him could not be found for him to use as evidence. Not until the twentieth century were they discovered in the Public Record Office. Would they have saved him? No, he had undoubtedly committed piracy against other ships. Who would have kept them from him? Many had reasons to keep even this slender hope from him. Kidd was sentenced to death for piracy and for the murder of Moore, his gunner. He was hanged at execution dock, Wapping, on 23 May 1701. Two attempts were necessary, as the first time the rope split and had to be rapidly replaced.<br>
<br>Kidd's treasure, said to be as much as &pound;400,000, has led to many treasure hunts from Nova Scotia to the South China Sea. Kidd never captured that much: the manifests of his victims were sent to England and their value is nothing of this order. He had ample opportunity to transfer funds to his wife and Livingston while keeping enough to lure Bellomont and the whig lords into obtaining pardons for him. This money was kept by the government and after various levies it amounted to &pound;6472, which in 1706 Queen Anne donated to the Royal Hospital for Seamen at Greenwich, to further its charitable purposes and the construction of the Old Royal Naval College. Kidd was survived by his wife, who remarried after his death, to become Sarah Rousby.<br>
