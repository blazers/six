<span class="headword">Armstrong,  Martin Donisthorpe</span>  (1882&#150;1974), <span class="occ">poet and novelist</span>, was born at 2 Jesmond Gardens, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 2 October 1882, the son of Charles Francis Armstrong, architect, of Brisco Hill, Carlisle, Cumberland, and his wife, Edith Lucy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Donisthorpe. He came from a well-to-do family and enjoyed a comfortable childhood, the memories of which he later recounted in his autobiographical novel, <span class="italic">Victorian Peep-Show</span> (1938). He was educated at Charterhouse School, Surrey, and at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where in 1908 he earned a BA in mechanical science. After working for two years in an architect's office, he spent a year in Italy studying pre-Renaissance and Renaissance Italian art. In April 1911 he met the American poet Conrad Aiken in Florence, and they developed an intense personal and professional relationship that lasted well into the 1920s.<br>
<br>Armstrong's first collection of poetry, <span class="italic">Exodus and other Poems</span> (1912), was published after his return from Italy. However, his fledgeling literary career was suspended shortly thereafter with the outbreak of the First World War. In 1914 Armstrong enlisted as a private in the Artists' Rifles, obtained a commission in 1915 in the 8th (Middlesex) regiment, and in 1917 was sent to the French front, where he remained until the armistice. Upon his return to England he was appointed to a post in the Ministry of Pensions. A year later he resigned to resume his literary career in earnest, and in the early 1920s he began regularly publishing his poetry and literary criticism in a variety of journals, including <span class="italic">The Bookman</span>, the <span class="italic">London Mercury</span>, and <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, where he was associate literary editor from 1922 to 1924. He also published two more volumes of poetry, including <span class="italic">Thirty New Poems</span> (1918) and <span class="italic">The Buzzards and other Poems</span> (1921). Much of his popularity during this period was due to his association with the Georgian poets, Walter de la Mare and Edmund Blunden among them, who were celebrated in <span class="italic">Georgian Poetry</span>, published annually by London's Poetry Bookshop until 1922.<br>
<br>During the mid-1920s Armstrong began devoting his efforts to story-writing and novels. In subsequent years he published several volumes of stories, including <span class="italic">The Bazaar and other Stories</span> (1924), <span class="italic">Saint Hercules and other Stories</span> (1927), and <span class="italic">Sir Pompey and Madame Juno, and other Tales</span> (1927). His first novel, <span class="italic">The Goat and Compasses</span>, was published in 1925, followed closely by <span class="italic">Desert: a Legend</span> (1926), <span class="italic">The Stepson</span> (1927), <span class="italic">The Water is Wide</span> (1927), and <span class="italic">Saint Christopher's Day</span> (1928), the last a considerable commercial success. In September 1929 his friend, the poet John Freeman, fondly described Armstrong's personal outlook as &#145;sane and humorous, avoiding tragedy as far as he possibly can. &hellip; He has preserved the English tradition of reticence and restraint&#146;. Freeman also praised Armstrong's poetry and prose, and noted that he was more than merely a poet or a novelist, but rather &#145;a man of letters in a closer application of the phrase than is commonly justified&#146;  (Freeman, 287). Indeed, the variety of Armstrong's literary pursuits confirms Freeman's conclusion, for in addition to his verse, short stories, criticism, and novels, he had published an English translation of Pedro Antonio de Alarc&oacute;n's <span class="italic">El sombrero de tres picos</span> (as <span class="italic">The Three-Cornered Hat</span>, 1928) and a biography, <span class="italic">Lady Hester Stanhope</span> (1927). On 15 January 1930 he married Jessie Aiken, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McDonald (1889&#150;1970), a Canadian, and the divorced wife of Conrad Aiken; they had one son, David.<br>
<br>In 1931 Armstrong's <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> appeared, and in 1934 the popular volume <span class="italic">The Major Pleasures of Life</span>, which he edited, was published. He published six additional novels in the ensuing decade: <span class="italic">The Romantic Adventures of Mr Darby and of Sarah his Wife</span> (1931), <span class="italic">Lover's Leap: a Story in Three Voices</span> (1932), <span class="italic">The Foster-Mother</span> (1933), <span class="italic">Venus over Lannery</span> (1936), <span class="italic">The Snake in the Grass</span> (1938), and <span class="italic">The Butterfly</span> (1941). Although the novels published during the latter part of his career received considerable praise in the English press, they never enjoyed the commercial success of his earlier works. He also published three more volumes of short stories, including <span class="italic">General Buntop's Miracle and other Stories</span> (1934), <span class="italic">A Case of Conscience and other Tales</span> (1937), and <span class="italic">Simplicity Jones and other Stories</span> (1940).<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Armstrong was instrumental in organizing a civil defence administration for the Sussex countryside, where he also served as air raid warden. After the war he began to advance his career into still more diverse media, often at the behest of his literary agent, the renowned A. D. Peters. In 1944 he began writing a weekly column, &#145;The spoken word&#146;, for the BBC's flagship journal, <span class="italic">The Listener</span>, and it ran for nearly thirteen years. Some of his most popular endeavours appeared on the radio in the 1940s, and he was a frequent contributor to the BBC's <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span>, where his novel for children, <span class="italic">Said the Cat to the Dog</span> (1945), was immensely popular and enjoyed many repeat performances. The sequel, <span class="italic">Said the Dog to the Cat</span>, was published in 1948. <span class="italic">The Essential Mary Webb</span>, which he edited, was published in 1949, and an anthology of his short stories, <span class="italic">Selected Stories</span>, appeared in 1951.<br>
<br>Anthony Bertram, the novelist and art critic, remembered Armstrong as being:<blockquote>essentially level-headed, and his keen mind, his tolerance and his wit were never marred by prejudice. It was that balance which enabled him to write such exquisite prose; and it was a fine human sympathy, working unostentatiously under his dry exterior, that flowered in the tenderness of his stories. Through his poems, but never in his workaday life, one saw into a glamorous and tragic imagination. (Bertram, 53&#150;4)</blockquote>Armstrong's novels, his most substantial artistic accomplishment, were written in the Edwardian tradition of John Galsworthy and Arnold Bennett and are characterized by carefully drawn portraits of figures from the upper-middle-class society into which he was born. The characters often reflect the class values that he himself averred, especially his respect for justice and tradition, his love of the countryside, and his concern for social harmony in relationships between the sexes. At the same time, however, his novels frequently assault the class values which he deplored, particularly snobbery, materialism, and indifference. Together, these conflicting elements converge and impinge upon the characters in his troubled fictive world, forging a kind of novel of manners in which his characters search for love and justice in a universe where often neither is to be found, or, if at all, only after a long and difficult struggle. The amalgamation of these figures in his canon of novels produces an intriguing critique of Edwardian class values, while at the same time offering a selection of characters of great interest for their personal cultivation and sensitivity. Armstrong died at his home in Sutton, near Pulborough, Sussex, on 24 February 1974.<br>
