<span class="headword">Fane, Sir  Francis</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1691), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Francis Fane (<i>d</i>. 1680), of Fulbeck, Lincolnshire, and Elizabeth, widow of John Darcy and daughter of William West, of Firbeck, Yorkshire. He was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9139/', "Mildmay Fane, second earl of Westmorland")</script>. At the coronation of Charles II he was created a knight of the Bath. In 1661 he and Sir Henry (possibly his brother) petitioned the king, asking to be confirmed to &#145;the rank of grandsons of earls, in which at the coronation they were placed before baronets&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1660&#150;61</i>, 603). About the time of his marriage on 16 February 1664 to Hannah, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24288/', "John Rushworth (c.1612&#150;1690)")</script>, Fane and other adventurers acquired an interest in the draining of the Eight Hundred Fen, near Boston, Lincolnshire. In a series of letters (now in the Clayton MSS, Yale University) sent to Sir Robert Clayton, sheriff of London, between February 1672 and November 1674, Fane requested Clayton's financial support in some commercial transactions, including the sale of Firbeck Manor, Yorkshire. According to an undated memorandum, having incurred heavy debts, Fane expected parliament to pass an act allowing him to sell the manor, which at the time of his marriage had been settled on his wife Hannah and the couple's male children. The sole executor of his father's will, dated 7 June 1679, Fane inherited the sum of &pound;1800, evidently the lion's share of the legacy.<br>
<br>Fane was the author of <span class="italic">Love in the Dark</span> (1675), a comedy performed (possibly for the first time) at the Theatre Royal on 10 May 1675, and <span class="italic">The Sacrifice</span>, a tragedy printed in 1686 but never acted. In the dedication of the latter play to the earl of Dorset the author confessed to &#145;having long since devoted himself to a country life, and wanting patience to attend the leisure of the stage&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Styling <span class="italic">Love in the Dark</span> &#145;the struglings of his Maiden Pen&#146;  (Danchin, 1.661), Fane dedicated the play in adulatory terms to the earl of Rochester, who had composed an epilogue for the 1675 performance and whose &#145;most charming and instructive conversation&#146; had made Fane &#145;not only a better Poet, a better Philosopher; but much more than those, a better Christian&#146;  (Farley-Hills, 37). Apart from writing a hyperbolic poem on the earl's sickness, Fane also contributed a masque to Rochester's <span class="italic">Valentinian</span> (1685), an adaptation of Fletcher's tragedy, first published in 1647. Both the poem and the masque were included in Nahum Tate's <span class="italic">Poems by Several Hands</span> (1685). An elegy &#145;On the Death of the Earl of Rochester&#146;, printed anonymously in 1684, is also attributed to Fane (Bodl. Oxf., MS Firth c 15). <span class="italic">The Sacrifice</span> was eulogized by Aphra Behn and Tate, who praised Fane for tempering &#145;Shakespear's Flame with Johnson's Art&#146;  (Todd, 1.425).<br>
<br>Gerard Langbaine, in his <span class="italic">Account of the English Dramatick Poets</span>, published in Easter term 1691, recorded that Fane was living at Fulbeck Hall. However, he died in Henbury, Gloucestershire, on 8 April 1691. In his will, dated 14 November 1689, Fane left various sums of money to the poor of several Gloucestershire parishes and provided for the payment of outstanding debts, including &pound;6 owed to Sir Thomas Skipwith, probably the theatre manager at Drury Lane and Dorset Garden. As appears from the probate to his will, dated 15 September 1691, his widow who had been made the sole executrix, expressly resigned her commission in favour of the eldest son, another Sir Francis.<br>
