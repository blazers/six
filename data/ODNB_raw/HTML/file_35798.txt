<span class="headword">Robinson, Sir  Joseph Benjamin</span>, first baronet  (1840&#150;1929), <span class="occ">mine owner in South Africa</span>, was born at Cradock, Cape Colony, on 3 August 1840, the youngest son of Robert John Robinson (<i>d</i>. 1886), a farmer, and his wife, Martha Emily (<i>d</i>. 1854), daughter of William Henry Strutt. Robinson's parents had emigrated from England about 1820, as participants in a colonization scheme promoted by the British government. On 3 October 1877 he married Elizabeth Rebecca (<i>d</i>. 1930), daughter of James Ferguson, a Kimberley merchant. They had five sons and eight daughters, three daughters dying in infancy.<br>
<br>Robinson was first employed as a storekeeper and wool buyer at Dordrecht, Cape Colony, in 1856. In 1865 he fought with an Orange Free State commando unit in the Basuto War. After farming and stock breeding for several years Robinson, in 1867, prospected successfully in Griqualand's Vaal River diamond diggings. He was one of the earliest arrivals in 1871 at the Kimberley diggings, where as a diamond merchant he made his first fortune.<br>
<br>Robinson bought the Kimberley <span class="italic">Independent</span> in 1873, was elected mayor of Kimberley in 1880, and in 1882 defeated Cecil Rhodes for the Kimberley seat in the Cape Colony house of assembly. A vigorous opponent of illicit diamond trading, Robinson in 1882 secured passage of the <span class="roman">Diamond Trade Act</span>, which forced a person possessing an uncut stone to prove ownership. He was among the first to grasp the possibilities of the Transvaal gold discoveries, and one of the earliest arrivals in the Rand goldfield in 1886. Starting with the Langlaate Farm about 25 miles from Johannesburg, he pieced together several western Rand goldfields into the Randfontein Estates Company. By 1891 Robinson's Rand gold claims were valued at over &pound;15 million. He also acquired valuable goldfields at Barberton in Natal colony. At the end of the century Robinson was generally acknowledged to be the titan of the South African gold industry, wealthier than Cecil Rhodes, Alfred Beit, Adolf Goerz, and other leading entrepreneurs [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95075', "Randlords")</script>].<br>
<br>Unlike the Rhodes group of capitalists, with whom he was never on good terms, Robinson cultivated the friendship of Transvaal's Boer politicians, especially President Paul Kruger. Robinson was completely unsympathetic to the Uitlander conspiracy that culminated in the Jameson raid of 1896. He kept aloof from the South African War of 1899&#150;1902, but from his recently acquired London home was in touch with moderate Boer politicians, including J. C. Smuts. Robinson contributed funds to the pro-Boer wing of the British Liberal Party during the 1900 election.<br>
<br>Robinson's success in recruiting black miners in South Africa proved that Sir Alfred Milner's Chinese indentured labour scheme was not needed. His ridicule of the Milner plan furnished useful ammunition to the Liberals in the 1906 election. His financial support of the Liberal Party, and his advocacy of self-government in the conquered South African republics, earned him his baronetcy in 1908.<br>
<br>Joseph B. Robinson was arrogant, quarrelsome, ruthless, highly individualistic&#151;and unpopular with many of his social and financial peers. On the other hand, his employees viewed him as exacting but fair. His almost total deafness made personal relations difficult in any event. He undoubtedly cut many corners in his business dealings, and was frequently in legal difficulties. Nevertheless, after moving to London in the late 1890s he became an acquaintance of other wealthy men, and was on the fringe of the prince of Wales's social circle. He retired from business in 1916 after selling his Rand properties, but subsequently some shady dealings came to light and resulted in considerable embarrassment for him. In 1921 he lost a suit brought against him in the South African courts for misrepresentation, stock-watering, and inside trading, which forced him to pay &pound;462,000 in damages. Further humiliation came in 1922 when Robinson had to decline a peerage offered by the Lloyd George government, following attacks on his business ethics in the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Robinson died at his residence, Hawthornden, Wynberg, near Cape Town, on 30 October 1929. He was succeeded as second baronet by his eldest surviving son, Joseph Benjamin Robinson (1887&#150;1954). Much of his outstanding collection of paintings had been sold at auction in 1923; he donated the remainder to the South African National Gallery in Cape Town. His second daughter, Ida Louise (<i>d</i>. 1961), married Count Natale Labia (<i>d</i>. 1936), the Italian minister to South Africa, and was given the rank and title of princess by the king of Italy.<br>
