<span class="headword">Manfield, Sir  Moses Philip</span>  (1819&#150;1899), <span class="occ">shoe manufacturer and politician</span>, was born on 26 July 1819 in Bristol, son of Moses Philip Manfield, a shoemaker. He came from a poor working-class household, and was supported by his mother after his father was paralysed. Unitarian in religion, his mother educated him herself until he was apprenticed at the age of twelve as a boot closer in a shoe manufacturing business, rising to become a manager.<br>
<br>In 1843 Manfield moved to Northampton as a manager but the business failed. With the help of local Unitarians in 1844 he established himself in business, specializing at this stage in the lower end of the market and government contracts. In 1845 he married Elizabeth Cambridge Newman (1819&#150;1852); they had one child who did not survive. Elizabeth died in 1852 and in 1854 he married Margaret Milne (<i>c</i>.1821&#150;1899), with whom he had two sons. In 1856 Manfield opened a large new warehouse to serve his outworkers but more work was gradually done indoors as the mechanization of the industry proceeded. However, even in the early 1890s the 630 indoor workers were outnumbered by outdoor workers employed by the firm. Under Manfield's chairmanship the firm of Manfield &amp; Sons became one of the leading Northampton shoe manufacturing companies and an important influence on the wider development of the town and industry. In 1892 industry attention was attracted when he opened a large purpose-built factory capable of producing some 350,000 pairs of shoes a year. At that point Manfield relinquished day-to-day control of the firm to his sons, who had already established themselves as a key part of the family management team.<br>
<br>The firm remained at the forefront of technical change during Manfield's period of control. He saw both the productivity potential of new technology and its advantage in allowing closer workforce supervision within the factory. He was also a marketing innovator, seeing the value of branded goods and pioneering a chain of shops which numbered thirty at his death. The protracted mechanization of the industry, along with pressure on wages, created periodic labour discontent and as the leading Northampton manufacturer Manfield played a key role in organizing local producers in a Northampton chamber of commerce and then the Boot and Shoe Manufacturers' Association. After some bitter disputes, he encouraged union recognition and arbitration machinery which he later helped to develop elsewhere.<br>
<br>Manfield played an influential political role in a Liberal revival in Northampton and the wider county. He was a member of the Northampton Reform League in the late 1860s. Manfield initially opposed the official Liberal candidature of Charles Bradlaugh in Northampton, but supported him in his fight for his parliamentary seat; he subsequently succeeded Bradlaugh, serving with Henry Labouchere as one of the MPs for the town between 13 February 1891 and 8 July 1895. Manfield made a limited impact on parliament, but saw himself as a representative of a &#145;working class constituency&#146; and a radical Liberal supporting Gladstone on home rule. He was far more influential in local politics, serving as a councillor from 1866 to 1877 before losing his seat as a result of divisions caused by the radical candidature of Bradlaugh. He served again as a councillor from 1882 to 1892 and as mayor from 1883 to 1884. He was then involved in a dispute between the town and the government over the latter's refusal to accept a Liberal list for magistrates, but eventually was himself appointed to the bench.<br>
<br>Although Manfield was kindly regarded in his final years as the &#145;Grand Old Man&#146;, his brand of unevenly radical Liberalism was being undercut by the growth of a local socialist movement which was critical of the role of local employers as a class. He was knighted on 18 July 1894 and made a freeman of Northampton shortly before his death. With his wife he patronized many local causes, including the building of a new Unitarian church and school, which they financed shortly before their deaths. He was also involved in the National Educational Association.<br>
<br>Manfield died at his home, Redlands, Cliftonville, Northampton, on 31 July 1899 and was buried on 3 August at Northampton general cemetery. His wife died shortly before him on 12 July 1899.<br>
