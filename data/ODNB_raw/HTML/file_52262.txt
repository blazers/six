<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Neligan,  Dorinda</span>  (1833&#150;1914), <span class="occ">headmistress and suffragette</span>, was born on 9 June 1833 in Cork, the fifth daughter of Thomas Neligan, a lieutenant in the army. She was educated at home by her mother, a woman of great culture, and later in Germany and Paris before becoming a &#145;finishing governess&#146;. From August 1870 to March 1871 she served with the Red Cross in France during the Franco-Prussian War, being in sole charge of the wounded at Metz during the siege. In direct contravention of orders, she personally sawed up a supply of wooden desks, found in the basement of the makeshift hospital, for fuel to keep the frozen men warm.<br>
<br>Just three years later, without ever having had either any formal higher education or experience of teaching in schools, Dorinda Neligan was appointed by the Girls' Public Day School Company (GPDSC), under the patronage of Mrs Maria Grey, to be one of the first headmistresses of a girls' high school in Britain. Croydon High School for Girls, undenominational and &#145;classless&#146; like all GPDSC schools, began with eighty pupils in 1874. By 1876 the roll had already risen to 175. In the early days Miss Neligan had to run the gauntlet of criticism from ill-wishers. There had originally been objections to the very founding of the school: a local newspaper suggested that it would bankrupt existing private girls' schools in the area; neighbours feared intolerable noise disturbance from the girls in the playground; others simply did not want &#145;strong-minded&#146; women encouraging girls to be dissatisfied with life at home. Once the school was in existence some parents objected to the teaching of physiology. In 1875 two local shareholders of the Croydon school alleged that Miss Neligan evaded the GPDSC's printed regulations and was not enough of a disciplinarian. She was fully vindicated, however, by the GPDSC's education committee and then by the council of the GPDSC, and continued with her school policy of no rewards and no punishments  (Kamm, 61). She fully believed that girls would be sufficiently motivated by the joy of learning in itself and that their sense of honour would lead them voluntarily to admit to any shortcomings. Whereas Miss Buss looked upon girls as potential devils, Miss Neligan tended to treat them as potential angels  (<span class="italic">GPDST Newsletter</span>, 1958, 33).<br>
<br>An enthusiastic teacher, Miss Neligan could inspire interest in subjects as diverse as German poetry, Italian art, foreign travel, Gladstone's politics, and the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. &#145;There was nothing narrow, nothing conventional about Miss Neligan&#146;  (<span class="italic">Croydon High School Record</span>, 1924, 9). She was gifted with a fine presence, a most beautiful speaking voice, and a lively sense of humour, all of which combined with her intelligence and practical ability to make her a commanding personality for her staff and pupils at Croydon for twenty-seven years. The close connection between her school and university education for women was made clear in 1890 when she invited Miss A. J. Clough, principal of Newnham College, Cambridge, to present the Croydon girls with their Cambridge local examination certificates. Most important of all, she transmitted to her women teachers and pupils her own values of compassion, moral courage, and independent-mindedness.<br>
<br>After retiring in 1902 Dorinda Neligan devoted her time and energy to the struggle for women's suffrage. On one occasion, on refusing, as a voteless woman, to pay her rates, she had her silver teapot &#145;distrained&#146;. On 18 November 1910 Miss Neligan, by then seventy-seven years old, volunteered, together with the scientist Hertha Ayrton, Dr Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, Dr Louisa Garrett Anderson, Mrs Cobden-Sanderson, and Princess Sophia Duleep Singh, to form the first group of a Women's Social and Political Union deputation headed by Mrs Pankhurst to petition Asquith, the prime minister, in the Commons. They met in Parliament Square with some very rough treatment, being &#145;thrown from side to side by police and hooligans alike&#146;  (Sharp, 220&#150;21). Some of the &#145;hooligans&#146; were very possibly plain-clothes police. Winston Churchill, when home secretary in 1911, refused to grant an inquiry into the allegations of police brutality on that &#145;black Friday&#146;&#151;though urged to do so by Lord Robert Cecil, who had seen the medical evidence relating to the women's injuries. Miss Neligan was arrested for allegedly &#145;assaulting a police constable&#146; that day, but no charges were brought. Her student, colleague, and friend of many years, Eleanor Roper, testified that Dorinda Neligan absolutely &#145;<i>hated</i> war&#146;  (<span class="italic">GPDST Newsletter</span>, 1958, 31). She died, of heart disease and acute bronchitis, at her home, Oakwood House, 5 Sydenham Road, Croydon, on 17 July 1914, just a fortnight before the outbreak of the First World War. There is a brass tablet to her memory in Croydon parish church and a portrait of her by Shannon in Croydon high school.<br>
