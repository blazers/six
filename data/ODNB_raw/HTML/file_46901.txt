<span class="headword">DuVerger,  Susan</span> <span class="st"> [Susan Du Vergeere; <em>n&eacute;e </em>Suzanne  de La Vall&eacute;e]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1610, <em>d.</em> 1657<span class="mult">x</span>9), <span class="occ">translator and author</span>, was born in London and baptized at the French Huguenot church in Threadneedle Street on 29 April 1610, the fifth of the five children of Charles and Ester de La Vall&eacute;e. Nothing is known about her parents other than their names recorded in the baptismal records, or about her early life in London, but at some point before 1633, Suzanne de La Vall&eacute;e married Jean-Jacques DuVerger. In the early 1630s she gave birth to two daughters: Fran&ccedil;oise (<i>c</i>.1633) and Suzanne (<i>c</i>.1635). There is no more information about their family life.<br>
<br>DuVerger published two English translations of works by the French Catholic bishop Jean-Pierre Camus. In 1639 came <span class="italic">Admirable Events</span>, her translation of his collection of moralistic prose romance tales, which she dedicated to England's French Catholic queen, Henrietta Maria. Although the title-page gives the author only as S. DuVerger, the Stationers' register for 3 October 1638 lists the author of <span class="italic">Admirable Events</span> as Susan du Vergeere. In 1641 DuVerger published a second translation of Camus, entitled <span class="italic">Diotr&egrave;phe</span>. The dedicatory letter, to Elizabeth, Lady Herbert&#151;a zealous and active Catholic gentlewoman&#151;is signed simply S. DuVerger, but it refers pointedly to her earlier &#145;labours in this kind&#146;, suggesting that this DuVerger was also the translator of <span class="italic">Admirable Events</span>.<br>
<br>Susan DuVerger was probably also the author of an original prose work published in 1657, entitled <span class="italic">DuVergers Humble Reflections</span> with the lengthy subtitle &#145;Upon some passages of the right honorable the lady marchionesse of Newcastles Olio, or, An appeale from her mes-informed, to her owne better informed judgement&#146;. The <span class="italic">Humble Reflections</span> is a scholarly defence of monastic life against critical charges made by the prolific author Margaret Cavendish, the marchioness of Newcastle, in her 1655 work <span class="italic">The World's Olio</span>. Internal evidence suggests that the DuVerger of the title is an English woman. The author writes, in an introductory letter to the duchess, that the <span class="italic">Olio</span> promotes &#145;the honour of our nation, and sexe, wherin we have had but few arguments&#146;. Much later in the <span class="italic">Humble Reflections</span>, DuVerger includes a letter to Margaret Cavendish from a male friend who refers to the author as &#145;Mrs. DuVerger&#146; and describes her as a &#145;lover of learning, and a verie vertuoso in antiquities, beyond the rate of a woman&#146;. The <span class="italic">Humble Reflections</span> is a fascinating book-length letter to Cavendish. As a salvo in a public debate on religion between two educated women, this work is extremely unusual.<br>
<br>All three of DuVerger's published works raise challenging and as yet unanswered questions about her life. The most intriguing of these is why a woman born into a Huguenot family chose to publish works that seem to support Catholic culture and doctrine.<br>
<br>Susan DuVerger seems to have died soon after completing the <span class="italic">Humble Reflections</span>. In 1659 both her daughters emigrated from France to Quebec and married soon after their arrival. On their marriage records, their mother, listed as &#145;Suzanne de Laval de Londres, Angleterre&#146;, is described as deceased.<br>
