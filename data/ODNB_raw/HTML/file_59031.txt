<span class="headword">Mallory family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1100&#150;1300), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, of medieval Leicestershire, was first represented by <a name="cosubject_59008"></a><span class="headword">Richard [i] Mallory</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1160)<span class="occ"></span>, a follower of Robert, earl of Leicester, in the 1130s and 1140s. The Mallory name must have come to Leicestershire rather earlier, however, for it appears as the name of a family of substantial knights in the county of Meulan, in the French Vexin. It would therefore seem most likely that a Mallory arrived in the county at the time when Robert de Beaumont, count of Meulan, was earl there, that is between 1107 and 1118. The name Mallory is a nickname and could variously be interpreted as &#145;unlucky&#146; or &#145;foul-mouthed&#146;. Richard [i] had at least two probable sons, Richard [ii] and Anschetil, who seem to have taken the English and Norman fees of the family respectively on his death about 1160. It is from these two that the many and various branches of the family derive, although only the elder branch, settled at Kirkby Mallory, Leicestershire, will be followed here. However, <a name="cosubject_59009"></a><span class="headword">Anschetil Mallory</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1190)<span class="occ"></span>, seneschal of Robert de Breteuil, earl of Leicester, has to be noticed as a prominent character in the reign of Henry II, and a leading rebel of the wars of 1173&#150;4, who defended Leicester Castle against the royalists. Anschetil survived this political mistake and acquired English lands at Tachbrook Mallory, Warwickshire, where his family flourished into the fourteenth century.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_59010"></a><span class="headword">Richard [ii] Mallory</span>  (<em>d.</em> before 1175)<span class="occ"></span> of Kirkby Mallory, although less important politically than his younger brother and not attached to Earl Robert, had more considerable landed interests. A good marriage to Agnes, coheir of William (II) de Neufmarch&eacute;, brought Richard estates at Welton and Thrupp, Northamptonshire, held at fee-farm of 40<i>s</i>. from Leicester Abbey, and (from later evidence) land at Broughton Astley, Leicestershire, and the service of Billesley, Warwickshire (see below). Richard died at some time before 1175, and was survived for several years by his wife. He left as his heir William, but left also at least three other sons who obtained subtenancies in the Mallory lands, one of whom, Simon (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1208), founded a long-lasting cadet branch of the family at Welton, which survived into the fourteenth century. <a name="cosubject_59028"></a><span class="headword">William Mallory</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1202)<span class="occ"></span> was his father's eldest son, and took responsibility for granting the Welton estate as a subtenancy to his younger brother, Simon. This would seem to have been an internal family arrangement which thus allowed more than one son to succeed while still preserving the integrity of the family's lands. He married a certain Alice, but nothing more of her is known. William had only one known son, <a name="cosubject_59029"></a><span class="headword">Richard [iii] Mallory</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1217)<span class="occ"></span>, who seems to have been active in Leicestershire as early as 1201. He made a rather large number of known grants: the church of Kirkby, first to Philip of Kington and then to Thelsford Priory, Warwickshire; several parcels of land in the same place to the hospitals of St John and the Holy Trinity, Northampton; small estates in Kirkby to his uncle, Luke Mallory, and to one Alexander of Whitby; and the advowson of the chapel of Peckleton to William Motun. He was at one point attached to the retinue of Saer de Quincy, earl of Winchester, in whose service he died at Mountsorrel Castle in 1217. He married Cecilia, sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25041/', "Stephen of Seagrave")</script>, the justiciar, and through her obtained three carrucates at Burgh, Leicestershire. Her suits for dower between 1220 and 1222 make it possible to assess Richard [iii]'s interests as being at his death the manors of Kirkby, Welton, and Thrupp, four and a half virgates subinfeudated at Broughton Astley, and several subinfeudated estates within Kirkby. For this he answered for a half fee to the Montfort half of the earldom of Leicester, a small assessment for such a large estate.<br>
<br>Richard [iii] left four known sons, one of the younger of whom, Anschetil, founded yet another cadet branch of what was by now becoming a widespread family, at Octon in the East Riding of Yorkshire. The eldest son, <a name="cosubject_59030"></a><span class="headword">Thomas [i] Mallory</span>  (<em>b. </em>1201<span class="mult">x</span>5, <em>d.</em> in or after 1240)<span class="occ"></span>, succeeded to Kirkby as a minor; he was in wardship to Henry of Seagrave in 1222 and had come of age by 1226, when he presented to the rectory of Kirkby. In 1234 he was involved in a plea concerning the service owed for the old Neufmarch&eacute; estate of Billesley, Warwickshire, to which he apparently had some claim through his great-grandmother Agnes. Thomas was at that same time associated with the household of Simon de Montfort, but more closely with that of his uncle, Stephen of Seagrave. He was alive in 1240 but thereafter disappears; all that is known is that he was survived by his widow, Christina, and left a son and heir, <a name="cosubject_59031"></a><span class="headword">Henry Mallory</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1277)<span class="occ"></span>. Little is known of Henry, other than that he instituted a chantry for his father's soul at the hospital chapel of Holy Trinity, Northampton, and that he attested a charter of Earl Simon de Montfort before 1265. Henry was succeeded by one <a name="cosubject_59032"></a><span class="headword">Sir Thomas [ii] Mallory</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1299)<span class="occ"></span> by 1277, who was probably (but not certainly) his brother. Thomas [ii] was the first of the Kirkby branch of the family known to have been knighted. By contrast, the Mallorys of Tachbrook and Welton were consistently knighted throughout the thirteenth century. Thomas [ii] was a household knight of Edmund, earl of Lancaster, in the early 1290s and is last found in 1299, making purchases of land in Kirkby.<br>
<br>The Mallory family is a singularly well-documented example of the way that a gentry family could multiply and spread in several branches over two centuries, on what was initially a small endowment in land. By 1300 six distinct and related Mallory lineages can be distinguished, settled mostly in the midlands, four of them having produced knights of the county court. The Mallorys of Kirkby, the eldest branch, are an object lesson in how this was achieved on small means: by windfall marriages, magnate patronage, and subinfeudation. It is clear that by 1300 the Mallorys of Kirkby farmed directly comparatively little land, but existed on the services and maintenance owed them. It is also instructive how the Mallorys of several generations varied their magnate allegiance from generation to generation after the mid-twelfth century.<br>
