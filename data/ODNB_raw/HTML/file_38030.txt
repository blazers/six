<span class="headword">Stutchbury,  Samuel</span>  (1798&#150;1859), <span class="occ">naturalist and geologist</span>, was born in London on 15 January 1798, the third child and second son of Joseph Sidney Stutchbury (1769&#150;1810), gauging instrument maker, and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith (1776&#150;1820&times;29). Although he had little formal education, in 1820 Stutchbury became assistant to William Clift, conservator of the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. That same year, he married, on 2 August, Hannah Louise Barnard; a daughter, Louise, was born in 1822.<br>
<br>In 1825 Stutchbury became zoologist to the Pacific Pearl Fishery Company's expedition to the Tuamotu archipelago. His journal contains pertinent observations on the natural history and social conditions of the places visited and accounts of diving and pearling, and he made extensive collections of shells and native artefacts. Between 1827 and 1830 he was a dealer in natural-history specimens, associated with his brother, Henry Rome Stutchbury (1796&#150;1853). In 1831 Stutchbury became curator at the Bristol Institution, where he published significant papers on conchology and palaeontology and made the museum one of the best in Europe. He also carried out geological surveys of the mines of the duchy of Cornwall and others, and was involved in the early work of the first director of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, Henry De la Beche.<br>
<br>In 1850 Stutchbury resigned from his curatorship to become mineral surveyor of New South Wales, provoking the hostility of Revd William Clarke (1798&#150;1878), who had also applied for the position and who believed Stutchbury to be a mere museum curator, unqualified for field work. Following his appointment, Stutchbury spent five years mapping 80,000 square kilometres of eastern Australia (including part of what is now Queensland), virtually unaided. In the frenzy of gold-rush fever his work received little acknowledgement by officials at the time. He returned to Bristol in ill health in 1855, and undertook consulting work until his death, at 3 Park Street, Bristol, on 12 February 1859. He was buried on 17 February at Arnos Vale cemetery in Bristol.<br>
<br>Stutchbury had excellent powers of observation and a good critical sense, both of which made him a fine scientist, and his work has stood the test of time. He was not an aggressive person or of high social status, and he had little ambition for public notice, so he tended to be overshadowed by contemporaries such as Richard Owen (1804&#150;1892), Charles Darwin (1809&#150;1882), for whom he provided barnacles, and Charles Lyell (1797&#150;1875), who used his information on the Pacific islands and coral reefs.<br>
<br>Stutchbury became an associate of the Linnean Society in 1821, a fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1841, and he was an honorary member of a number of European scientific bodies. Somewhat portly and with an open countenance, his friendly co-operation and his knowledge were greatly appreciated by a wide range of scientists, who honoured him in the scientific names of a number of fossil and recent organisms.<br>
