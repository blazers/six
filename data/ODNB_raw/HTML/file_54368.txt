<span class="headword">Gutteridge,  Joseph</span>  (1816&#150;1899), <span class="occ">silk weaver and naturalist</span>, was born on 23 March 1816 in Coventry, the eldest of the three sons of Joseph Gutteridge, a recruiting sergeant, and his first wife, Sarah Shaw. Educated from 1821 in two schools, run by a Quaker woman and Wesleyan preacher respectively, he then went to Berkswell, where his uncle was a schoolmaster. There he made swift progress, particularly in natural science. After further study at Baker, Billing, and Crowe's charity school, where discipline was harsh, he was apprenticed to learn the craft of ribbon weaving about 1829. He found work at the Jacquard loom tiring, but continued to gain intense pleasure from observation of birds and plant life as well as geology and entomology. His invalid mother died and a tyrannical stepmother added to the misery of slumps in trade and riots against the introduction of steam power. However, by this time he was already known as a talented weaver who could also repair clocks and watches (he later made furniture, musical instruments, and even a microscope). He formed a botanical collection, classified according to Dr Withering (1776) and on Linnaean lines.<br>
<br>Still in indentures, Gutteridge married Sara Bate (<i>d</i>. 1855), a poor freethinker, on 5 January 1835 at St John the Baptist Church; they had five children. About this time Gutteridge acquired atheistical opinions from the discussions of the Coventry Mutual Improvement Class, and socialist principles from Robert Owen. During the slumps of 1838&#150;45 his growing family suffered severe privations from unemployment and illness, but he was refused help from a local charity by a clergyman on the grounds of his unbelief. His pride and independence of judgement also alienated him from the trade-union movement. Kindly neighbours saved the family from the workhouse or starvation, and the Manchester Oddfellows helped him to bury his fourth child, who died from smallpox.<br>
<br>In spite of industrial injury and unorthodox views, Gutteridge made progress in his trade, becoming a foreman and then working at home on an <i>&agrave; la bar</i> loom. A visit to the Great Exhibition of 1851 revived his interest in the applied arts and in natural science, particularly foreign botanical specimens. His wife's death from tuberculosis in December 1855 drew him to spiritualism: on 17 May 1857 Gutteridge married his second wife, Mary Hendon, a Wesleyan, at Bedworth. With an employer he worked on improvements to the Jacquard loom for the manufacture of brocaded ribbons, but received no benefit from the patent. He took a minor but active part in the strike and lock-out of 1860&#150;61 which followed the Cobden trade treaty: he hated the factory system which ensued, but soon adopted firm Liberal views.<br>
<br>Gutteridge was a pioneer of silk brocades in five colours for exhibition, and of portraits and views in silk. In September 1867 he was delegated as a working man to visit the Paris Exhibition and Switzerland for the Society of Arts, publishing an account in the society's <span class="italic">Reports of Artisans &hellip; Paris Universal Exhibition of 1867</span> (1867, 141&#150;3). He then worked for Thomas Stevens, celebrated for bookmarks and pictures in silk, giving exhibitions of his craft in Yorkshire in August 1870. Gutteridge was held in respect and gave evidence during a legal dispute over the needle-loom patent in 1874.<br>
<br>Old age and a decline in the Coventry silk industry brought Gutteridge close to destitution by 1891, when John Cox of the <span class="italic">Coventry Herald</span> encouraged him to co-operate in a series of autobiographical articles, based on a diary which was also the source of his autobiography, <span class="italic">Lights and Shadows in the Life of an Artisan</span> (1893). A copy was presented to W. E. Gladstone, and there were favourable reviews. A gift from the royal bounty fund and the provision of an annuity by friends followed. Having regained his religious faith through a study of natural science, he presented his extensive and well-catalogued natural history collection to his native city in 1896.<br>
<br>Gutteridge died at his home, 18 Yardley Street, Coventry, on 4 November 1899, following a stroke. A memorial service in the Great Meeting-House stressed his example to the young. His autobiography remains an impressive source for the history of the silk industry, working-class life, and urban development during the industrial revolution.<br>
