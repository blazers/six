<span class="headword">Toland,  John</span>  (1670&#150;1722), <span class="occ">freethinker and philosopher</span>, was born on 30 November 1670 on the peninsula of Inishowen, co. Donegal, Ireland. Although his parents are unknown, he supposedly was the illegitimate son of a Roman Catholic priest and was probably baptized Se&aacute;n Eoghain (Sean Owen, John's John). He later wrote that he had been baptized Janus Junius, a play on his name that recalled both the Roman two-faced god Janus and Junius Brutus, reputed founder of the Roman republic. Appealing to his ability to read ancient Gaelic texts, he claimed a respected Irish ancestry, probably descent from the U&iacute; Tuathall&aacute;in family, traditional historians and bards for the once powerful O'Neills.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlyyears"></a>Education and early years</h2>While still a child Owen of the Books (as Toland was known) developed a critical attitude toward his religious upbringing. At the age of sixteen he rejected Catholicism, &#145;the insupportable Yoke of the most Pompous and Tyrannical <i>Policy</i> that ever enslav'd Mankind under the name or shew of Religion&#146;  (J. Toland, <span class="italic">An Apology for Mr. Toland</span>, 1697, 16). Supported by Presbyterian sponsors who hoped that he would become a minister, he attended Redcastle School in Londonderry and in 1687 enrolled in the University of Glasgow. In 1689 he moved from Glasgow to the University of Edinburgh where he received the MA degree in 1690. In Edinburgh he seems to have had his first involvement with secret societies (probably the Rosicrucians). Soon afterwards he travelled to London where he tutored in the household of a wealthy widow and met prominent figures such as Daniel Williams &#145;the Presbyterian Pope&#146;. Impressed by the young Irishman, Presbyterians in London sent him to the universities of Leiden and Utrecht to study under Friedrich Spanheim the younger. From Spanheim he learned exegetical techniques of biblical criticism developed by Baruch Spinoza, Pierre Bayle, and Richard Simon.<br>
<br>At the Rotterdam house of the English Quaker merchant Benjamin Furly, Toland met the Dutch remonstrant theologians Philip van Limborch and Jean Le Clerc, who wrote letters of introduction for him to John Locke. They described Toland as a &#145;freespirited ingenious man&#146; and an &#145;excellent and not unlearned young man &hellip; frank, gentlemanly, and not at all of a servile character&#146;  (Daniel, 7). In the summer of 1693 he returned to London; a few months later he moved to Oxford to work at the Bodleian Library on an Irish dictionary and a dissertation proving that the Irish had been a colony of the Gauls. To the Ashmolean Museum curator Edward Lhuyd, Toland seemed arrogant but he impressed others (including the antiquary John Aubrey) as a promising scholar. He borrowed money from Locke, exchanged ideas about their manuscripts, and came to know Locke's closest friends, such as John Freke and James Tyrrell. In &#145;The fabulous death of Atilius Regulus&#146; he questioned the reliability of classical texts, and in his manuscript of &#145;Christianity not mysterious&#146; he combined a Lockean theory of meaning with strategies of biblical criticism learned from Spanheim. Locke's <span class="italic">Reasonableness of Christianity</span> (1695) seems to have been in part a response to points raised by Toland.<br>
<br>In conservative Oxford, Toland's coffee-house polemics quickly gained him a reputation as &#145;a man of fine parts, great learning, and little religion&#146;  (Daniel, 8). After the vice-chancellor ordered him out of the city, he retired to London and anonymously published <span class="italic">Two Essays Sent in a Letter from Oxford</span>. In <span class="italic">Two Essays</span> he introduced the materialist cosmology to which he would appeal for the rest of his life, arguing that fossils could have been shaped in rock by a &#145;plastic power&#146; that contains the seeds of all forms of matter.<h2>
<a name="ChristianitynotMysterious"></a>Christianity not Mysterious</h2>Toland was but twenty-five when his most famous work, <span class="italic">Christianity not Mysterious</span>, anonymously appeared late in 1695 (with a 1696 imprint). In it he argued that no tenets of true Christianity could be contrary to or above human reason, for if they were they would be unintelligible. This contradicted Locke who, in the <span class="italic">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</span> (1690), had argued that revealed truths (for example, about the divinity of Christ) may be above but are not contrary to reason. Toland countered that once a truth is divinely revealed, it is no longer beyond human comprehension; it is neither contrary to reason nor above reason. An unintelligible belief could not be an object of faith because no believer can assent to a doctrine without understanding what it would mean to hold that belief. He concluded that the so-called mysteries of Christianity are not essential to the faith at all but are either puzzles that can be solved or ploys by which priests exercise control over others.<br>
<br>The book immediately caused a furore and was presented to the grand jury of Middlesex. A second edition appeared in late summer 1696 identifying its author. In early 1697 Toland returned to Ireland and introduced himself to Locke's friend William Molyneux. Molyneux wrote to Locke that he had found Toland a &#145;candid free-thinker and a good scholar&#146; but that clerical animosity and Toland's practice of conducting theological disputes in taverns made it awkward to be seen with him  (Sullivan, 7). Apparently Toland had hoped to offer his scholarly and linguistic skills to the new lord chancellor, John Methuen. But in Dublin his book was denounced from the pulpit as a Socinian attack against the divinity of Christ, and Peter Browne, provost of Trinity College, Dublin, blasted him for reducing faith to mere knowledge. In September it was condemned by the Irish House of Commons and Toland was ordered to be arrested. Before the order could be carried out, he retreated to London and spent the next five years defending his &#145;juvenile thoughts&#146; and &#145;unadvised expressions&#146; (as he called them). In a self-deluded bid to stand in the general election for a borough in London, he sought to clear his name in 1702 by resolving &#145;never hereafter to intermeddle in any religious Controversies&#146;  (J. Toland, <span class="italic">Vindicius liberius</span>, 1702, 24).<br>
<br>None of this notoriety was missed by patrons attracted to his learning and free-spirited method of inquiry. Anthony Ashley Cooper, third earl of Shaftesbury, shared Toland's interest in antiquity, philosophy, religion, and opposition to superstition. It was probably through Shaftesbury that Toland met the leader of the &#145;country&#146; forces in the House of Commons, Robert Harley, later first earl of Oxford. Harley saw in Toland an advocate for traditional whig causes supporting religious toleration for dissenters and the protestant succession. Other whigs, such as John Holles, first duke of Newcastle, and Sir Robert Clayton, director of the Bank of England and mayor of London, commissioned Toland to prepare biographies and editions to show how Commonwealthsmen Algernon Sidney, Denzil Holles, Edmund Ludlow, John Milton, and James Harrington were models of public religion and civic virtue. With Ludlow's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> in particular, Toland took great liberties, changed its tone, improved its style, added his own reflections, and eliminated thousands of words written by the civil war republican. His portrait of Ludlow provided a model for both the notorious Calves-Head Club and for aristocratic whigs, and it united radical thinkers such as John Phillips, Matthew Tindal, and William Stephens, with members of the Grecian Club such as John Trenchard and Walter Moyle, and &#145;Roman&#146; whigs like Shaftesbury, Harley, and Robert Molesworth. In the <span class="italic">Militia Reform'd</span> and <span class="italic">The Danger of Mercenary Parliaments</span> (both 1698) he endorsed the effort of Harley's country party coalition of Jacobite tories and republican whigs to prevent William's standing army from entering England. In his life of John Milton (1698) he argued that the <span class="italic">Eikon basilike</span> was not written by Charles I, as claimed, but by his chaplain, Gauden, and he added that many ancient writings, both secular and religious, were forgeries. When he was accused of doubting the authenticity of the Christian scriptures, he displayed his scholarly and exegetical abilities in <span class="italic">Amyntor</span> (1699) with a list of more than seventy spurious gospels, epistles, and acts attributed by early Christian writers and church fathers to Christ, Mary, and the apostles. Always seeking to portray himself as a defender of the faith, Toland turned even seemingly academic disputes about religion into opportunities for political alliances and, prompted by Harley and Shaftesbury, drew those themes together in <span class="italic">The Art of Governing by Partys</span> and <span class="italic">Paradoxes of State</span> (1702).<br>
<br>Pleased by Toland's justification of the protestant succession in <span class="italic">Anglia libera</span> (1701), Harley requested that the Irishman be selected as a secretary to the embassy of Hanover under Charles Girard, second earl of Macclesfield. Toland had the honour to present the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span> and a copy of his book to the Electress Sophia, who in turn introduced him to the court in Berlin and to her daughter, Sophie Charlotte, queen of Prussia. Amused by his wit, impressed by his knowledge of ten languages, and attracted by his good looks, the queen liked to walk and converse with Toland for hours at a time. In turn, he presented her with his rare copy of Giordano Bruno's <span class="italic">Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast</span>.<br>
<br>In 1702 Toland returned to Berlin where, in numerous discussions in the presence of the queen, he and G. W. Leibniz began a philosophical exchange that would last for years. Although Leibniz expressed doubts about Toland's manners, he respected the young man's intellect and even wrote a brief reply to <span class="italic">Christianity not Mysterious</span>, which Toland received with great pleasure. Toland's suggestions that Leibniz pay special attention to the works of Bruno were generally ignored, but his promotion of the Italian thinker gained Toland notoriety for his knowledge of rare books and manuscripts containing heterodox doctrines.<br>
<br>While passing through Holland on this second trip to Germany, Toland provided Pierre Bayle with a materialistic account of the soul that Bayle incorporated into the second edition of his <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>. He also met Baron von Hohendorf, chief lieutenant to Prince Eug&egrave;ne of Savoy, commander of the armies of the Austrian Habsburgs, who commissioned him to increase the prince's library of rare and clandestine works. It was especially in this context that Toland encouraged the widespread study of Bruno in clandestine circles.<br>
<br>After his return to England Toland set to work on <span class="italic">Letters to Serena</span> (Queen Sophie Charlotte). In it he diagnosed the origin and force of prejudices and superstitions, argued that motion was essential to matter, and rejected Spinoza's ahistorical account of motion and Newton's reliance on divine agency. When the book was published in 1704, followers of Newton (notably Samuel Clarke) quickly recognized the political and religious implications of Toland's attack on Newtonian physics in that it indicated how individuals did not need external, whether monarchical, clerical, or spiritual, inspiration to act.<h2>
<a name="Politicalpropagandist"></a>Political propagandist</h2>After Harley became secretary of state in 1704, Toland expected to receive a more stable income than that provided by the occasional political piece commissioned by Harley. But Harley continued to rely on Toland merely as a source of information about intrigues on the continent and as a propagandist. Using the Quaker leader William Penn as an intermediary, Sidney Godolphin (the lord treasurer) had Toland compose <span class="italic">The Memorial of the State of England</span> (1705) to show how occasional religious conformity contributed to a stable commonwealth. Such commissions were hardly enough to support Toland, so Penn appealed to Harley on his behalf. Toland assured Harley that he had broken off the &#145;tattling and mean acquaintances&#146; of his coffee-house days and publicly presented himself as a staunch supporter of the Church of England  (Sullivan, 24). Although Harley remained aloof, Toland continued to supply him with confidential reports and to procure additions to his library.<br>
<br>In 1707 Toland returned to the continent. In D&uuml;sseldorf, desperate for money, he accepted a commission to write <span class="italic">The Declaration Lately Published by the Elector Palatine</span> (1707), in which he explained the elector's claim to have the right to curtail religious liberty, even if that meant the submission of protestants to Catholics. He next travelled to Hanover and Berlin and then on to Vienna where his knowledge of Bruno and hermetic texts was appreciated as nowhere else. He wintered in Prague at a convent of Irish Franciscans who attested to his ancestry and his scholarly credentials for Gaelic research. Early in 1708 he returned to Berlin where, despite his charm, he upset members of the court by claiming more privilege than his status warranted. In addition, he irritated Leibniz by drawing little distinction between superstition and true religion.<br>
<br>On his way back to England, Toland learned that Harley had been forced out of office, so without much prospect for fortune in England, he remained in Holland. His research turned to showing how primitive (especially Celtic) Christianity was not characterized by pomp or austere submission to a set of papist doctrines. Instead, he suggested, ancient Christianity celebrated fellowship, freedom of conscience, and egalitarian social virtues. Furthermore he imagined hermeneutic strategies for retrieving those ideals from centuries of institutionalized superstition. Some of this work he dedicated to his friend and fellow freethinker, Anthony Collins, in <span class="italic">Adeisidaemon</span> (&#145;The unsuperstitious man&#146;; 1709). He expanded on this research in <span class="italic">Nazarenus</span> (1718), in which he proposed that the ancient Celtic beliefs revealed in an Irish manuscript of the four gospels captured the true spirit of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. In <span class="italic">Reasons for Naturalizing the Jews</span> (1714), he even went so far as to suggest that Jews should be afforded the same rights as other citizens of the nation.<br>
<br>After Harley's return to power in the tory government of October 1710, Toland still believed that Harley was primarily committed to the protestant succession and Queen Anne. So Toland returned to England early in 1711, supported by Harley with work and a house at Epsom. When Harley was almost killed in an assassination attempt in March 1711, enemies of Toland spread a false rumour that the assassin was one of his correspondents. But Harley's affections for Toland (for whatever they were worth) had dissipated by then, and his concerns were less with maintaining whig ideals than with securing peace with the French. Toland knew this and shortly thereafter became an informer to Harley's political opponents.<br>
<br>For the next two years Toland's lifelong interests in religious toleration and civil liberty were the focus of his writings. When those principles seemed to have been thoroughly ignored in the government's negotiation of a commercial treaty with France in the treaty of Utrecht (1713), he declared his final break with Harley in his bitter work <span class="italic">The Art of Restoring</span> (1714). Because Toland had been a close friend and dependant of Harley, his explicit attack confirmed the suspicions of many Englishmen that Harley (now Lord Oxford) no longer supported the ideals of the protestant succession. Toland's book went through ten printings in less than a year, which provided him with the financial independence he needed to compose his equally popular treatise on whig political theory, <span class="italic">The State Anatomy of Great Britain</span> (1717).<h2>
<a name="Pantheist"></a>Pantheist</h2>In 1718 Toland published the results of his earlier work on biblical criticism and turned his attention to a projected monumental study of the druids. He was fascinated by the secretive activities of the ancient Irish, and in his <span class="italic">Tetradymus</span> (1720) and <span class="italic">Pantheisticon</span> (1720) he examined how the distinction between esoteric and exoteric doctrines function in religion and philosophy. His interest in the topic had appeared as early as in his <span class="italic">Letters to Serena</span>, and he had appropriated the term <i>pantheist</i> in his <span class="italic">Socinianism Truly Stated</span> from Joseph Raphson, who had referred to <i>panthei</i> and <i>pantheismus</i> in <span class="italic">De spatio reali, seu, Ente infinito</span> (1697). Like Raphson, Toland describes pantheists as those who think of God as the omnipresent space in which all material and immaterial distinctions are intelligible. God is not simply matter but that which is prior to all distinction, including the distinction between the material and immaterial. Because God is the matrix for all discernment, he is eminently accessible to every speaker and can hardly be considered mysterious. Pantheists tolerate promiscuous communication, therefore, because it is the means by which identity and differentiation first appear. In his <span class="italic">Origines Judaicae</span> (1709), Toland associated pantheists with Spinozists because their methodological toleration required that they limit philosophical discussion to what can be observed, namely, bodies in motion. He concluded that, if life itself is nothing more than such motion, then the adoption of a pantheistic attitude toward the universe and God would provide a tranquil temperament and peace of mind.<br>
<br>In the financial collapse of the South Sea Company in 1720, Toland lost what little money he had been given by his friend Robert Molesworth, by then Viscount Molesworth. The following year his already frail health declined further, aggravated by the polluted air of London. Although he moved out of the city to Putney his condition did not improve appreciably. Afflicted with kidney stones and apparently drinking heavily, he became bedridden at Christmas 1721. On 11 March 1722 in the cluttered room of a carpenter's house, he died surrounded by piles of his books and manuscripts stacked on the floor. According to one account he told those around him &#145;I thank you for your care, but I am poisoned by a physician&#146;  (Sullivan, 39). It is also said that when asked, immediately before he died, whether he wanted anything, he replied he wanted only death. And after bidding those around him farewell, he simply said that he was going to sleep&#151;an attitude that Voltaire greatly admired.<br>
<br>Toland was buried two days later in Putney churchyard, but because of his poverty no gravestone marks the spot. The Latin epitaph he composed for himself concluded: &#145;His spirit is joined with its ethereal father from whom it originally proceeded; his body likewise yielding to nature is laid again in the lap of its mother. But he's frequently to rise himself again, yet never to be the same Toland more &hellip; If you would know more of him, search his writings&#146;  (Daniel, 13&#150;14).<br>
<br>Because Toland's life and writings were filled with challenges to propriety, he generated great hostility. By making reason a criterion of knowledge and faith, he raised doubts about the legitimacy of beliefs and texts and continued to prompt responses from apologists throughout the eighteenth century. His criticism of arbitrary power and his widely read editions of Sidney, Ludlow, Milton, and Harrington had, for many, the unsettling effect of bringing together republican and classical ideals. In the long term it provided a foundation for the whig intellectual tradition that influenced Maximilien Robespierre, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Thomas Paine. On the continent Toland's blend of polemics and toleration, his defence of liberty, and critique of religious excess, attracted Voltaire and other Enlightenment figures. According to Denis Diderot and the baron d'Holbach, his doctrine of the essential activity of matter undermined the simplistic distinction between matter and spirit that had burdened metaphysics since Descartes. Freemasons throughout Europe appropriated his clandestine practices and pantheist philosophy as models for responding to surreptitious efforts to impose ways of thinking and social order. In recent years the ground-breaking bibliographic work of Giancarlo Carabelli has opened up new prospects for research on Toland. Several major studies of his life and thought have been published since then, culminating in 1996 with a flurry of books and articles on the tercentenary of the publication of <span class="italic">Christianity not Mysterious</span>. Because of Toland's interest in challenging the bounds of propriety, he has been the object of work in hermeneutics, deconstruction, and post-structuralism. Not surprisingly, the assessment of his importance in understanding the political and religious intrigues of the early eighteenth century still provokes controversy.<br>
