</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Smith,  Sydney Goodsir</span>  (1915&#150;1975), <span class="occ">poet and playwright</span>, was born on 26 October 1915 in Wellington, New Zealand, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36159/', "Sir Sydney Alfred Smith (1883&#150;1969)")</script> and his wife, Catherine Goodsir Gelenick (1866/7&#150;1962). In 1928 his father became professor of forensic medicine at the University of Edinburgh; he himself was educated there and at Oriel College, Oxford, where he gained a third class in modern history in 1937. During the Second World War he taught English to Polish troops. By the late 1940s he had emerged as the leading figure of the second wave of the Scottish literary &#145;Renaissance&#146;, and over the ensuing decades he gained a reputation as a convivial and cultured presence in the legendary &#145;writers' pubs&#146; of Edinburgh, as well as in more conventionally scholarly circles.<br>
<br>Smith's earliest collections of poetry include <span class="italic">Skail Wind</span> (1941), <span class="italic">The Wanderer and other Poems</span> (1943), <span class="italic">The Deevil's Waltz</span> (1946), and <span class="italic">Selected Poems</span> (1947). Although he was not a native speaker of Scots, Smith succeeded in developing a convincing idiom based on the speech which he heard in the pubs and in the streets, enriched by his absorption of the great medieval Scots makars (makers, poets). The consequent range of registers, from the vernacular to the highly ornamented and stylized, was an invaluable resource for a poet concerned with sudden and contrasting changes of mood and feeling. The sequence <span class="italic">Under the Eildon Tree</span> (1948) comprises twenty-five poems invoking the great lovers in history, legend, and literature, and setting them beside the poet's own love life; the poems alternate between passion and disillusionment, toughened by Smith's irreverent wit, his abiding awareness that the sublime and the ridiculous are interdependent.<br>
<br>Smith became one of the foremost virtuosi of twentieth-century Scottish poetry, often at his most workmanlike when most playful; he delighted in the plasticity of language, in Joycean verbal pyrotechnics. This is most marked in his semi-novelistic prose work <span class="italic">Carotid cornucopius</span> (1947), which has been compared to <span class="italic">Finnegans Wake</span> (1939). The wordplay of <span class="italic">Under the Eildon Tree</span> is frequently of a macaronic nature; indeed, the sequence amply demonstrates that Smith's love of language was by no means limited to Scots, and testifies to his wider European frame of cultural reference. He translated poems by Tristan Corbi&egrave;re and Aleksandr Blok into Scots, and his celebrated &#145;The Grace of God and the Meth-Drinker&#146; is the Edinburgh Grassmarket's equivalent of the tatterdemalion grotesqueries of a Villon or a Baudelaire:<blockquote>
<div>There ye gang, ye daft<br>
</div>
<div>And doitit dotterel, ye saft<br>
</div>
<div>Crazed outland skalrag saul<br>
</div>
<div>In your bits and ends o winnockie duds<br>
</div>
<div>Your fyled and fozie-fousome clouts<br>
</div>
<div>As fou's a fish<br>
</div> (S. G. Smith, <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>, 1975)</blockquote>Smith's reputation grew during the 1950s. He belonged to the group of poets who were associated, as contributors and editors, with the Scottish literary magazine <span class="italic">Lines Review</span> (published 1952&#150;98). <span class="italic">The Aipple and the Hazel</span> (1951), <span class="italic">So Late into the Night</span> (1952), <span class="italic">Cokkils</span> (1953), <span class="italic">Omens</span> (1955), <span class="italic">Orpheus and Eurydice</span> (1955), <span class="italic">Figs and Thistles</span> (1959), and <span class="italic">The Vision of the Prodigal Son</span> (1960) bore testimony to a prolific decade as a poet. In addition, he was active as a literary critic and editor. His pamphlet <span class="italic">A Short Introduction to Scottish Literature</span> appeared in 1951; he edited <span class="italic">Robert Fergusson, 1750&#150;1774: Essays by Various Hands</span> (1952) and <span class="italic">Gavin Douglas: a Selection from his Poetry</span> (1959). A lifelong admirer and student of Robert Burns, he co-edited (with James Barke) the bawdy <span class="italic">Robert Burns: the Merry Muses of Caledonia</span> (1959). In 1966 he followed this up with <span class="italic">A Choice of Burns's Poems and Songs</span>.<br>
<br>In 1959 Smith and his poet friends C. M. Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) and Norman MacCaig were installed as the &#145;club bards&#146; of the newly founded 200 Burns Club. In addition to MacDiarmid and MacCaig, Smith's immediate literary circle included Tom Scott and the Gaelic poet Sorley MacLean. He edited, with Kulgin Duval, <span class="italic">Hugh MacDiarmid: a Festschrift</span> to mark that poet's seventieth birthday in 1962.<br>
<br>Smith's political passions&#151;left-wing, nationalist&#151;were counterpointed by a man-of-the-world scepticism; he allowed them full sway in his verse play, <span class="italic">The Wallace</span> (1960), which dramatizes the revolt and capture of Scotland's national hero. It was revived by the Scottish Theatre Company at the Edinburgh International Festival of 1985, and is likely to remain Smith's most controversial work. His other plays included <span class="italic">Collickie Meg</span>, based on characters from <span class="italic">Carotid cornucopius</span>, and <span class="italic">The Stick-up</span>, which the Scottish composer Robin Orr turned into an opera; it was performed by the national company, Scottish Opera. In &#145;The Twa Brigs&#146;, composed in 1964 to mark the opening of the Forth Road bridge, the poet makes a plea for greater communication, tolerance, and love between people, but the roguish humour offsets any tendency towards moralizing. Another Scottish composer, William Wordsworth, made a musical setting of this poem for a performance in 1973, while a third, Ronald Stevenson, maintained that he had to restrain himself from setting one Smith poem after another. Smith was no narrow litt&eacute;rateur, but a man who embraced all the arts or was embraced by them.<br>
<br>Later sequences and collections included <span class="italic">Kynd Kittock's Land</span> (1965), <span class="italic">Fifteen Poems and a Play</span> (1969), and <span class="italic">Gowdspink in Reekie</span> (1974), the last volume to appear in Smith's lifetime. With his customary loving mockery, <span class="italic">Kynd Kittock's Land</span> celebrates the contradictions of his adopted Edinburgh:<blockquote>
<div>This rortie wretched city<br>
</div>
<div>Sair come doun frae its auld hiechts.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Smith was a melancholy clown. He was variously nicknamed the Kilted Kiwi, or&#151;more frequently and affectionately&#151;the Great Auk. An accomplished artist in his own right, he was for many years the art critic of <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>.<br>
<br>In 1938 Smith had married Marion Elise Welsh (1906&#150;1966) and on 28 December 1967 he married a schoolteacher, Hazel Elizabeth Simpson Williamson (1928&#150;2004). He died suddenly, at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh, on 15 January 1975; at the time a volume of his <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> was in production. It was seen through the press by Tom Scott and published later that year, with an introduction by Hugh MacDiarmid. Smith was buried in Dean cemetery, Edinburgh, on 19 January, and a bronze plaque, bearing his likeness in profile, was affixed to the outer wall of his former residence, 25 Drummond Place, Edinburgh.<br>
