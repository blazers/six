<span class="headword">Paynel family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1086&#150;1244), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, whose original home may have been Les Moutiers-Hubert in Normandy, was first represented in England by <a name="cosubject_21087"></a><span class="headword">Ralph Paynel</span>  (<em>d.</em> before 1124)<span class="occ"></span> whose tenancy-in-chief was valued at over &pound;80 a year in 1086, and who also held a tenancy of Ilbert (I) de Lacy in Yorkshire valued at &pound;9 10<i>s</i>. a year. The Lacy tenancy may have been acquired through a possible marriage to Ilbert's sister or daughter. After 1086 Ralph acquired further estates in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, including a share of the lands held in 1086 by Richard de Surdeval of Robert, count of Mortain, which may have come to Ralph as a result of a second marriage to a certain Maud, with whom Ralph had four sons and a daughter. The eldest son, Jordan, was provided for with most of the Surdeval estates, married Gertrude, a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54505/', "Fossard family")</script>, and eventually died childless. His estates thus passed to his brother Alexander Paynel (<i>d</i>. in or before 1153), the ancestor of the Paynels of Hooton Pagnell. In 1088, when William II faced a baronial rebellion in England, Ralph Paynel served as sheriff of Yorkshire, attended the trial of William de St Calais, bishop of Durham, and was accused by the bishop of invading and seizing his lands. In the period <i>c</i>.1090&#150;1100 Ralph refounded Holy Trinity, York, as a dependent priory of the abbey of Marmoutier, Tours. He was also a benefactor of St Mary's Abbey, York, St Peter's Hospital, York, and the abbey of Selby.<br>
<br>Ralph's lands in Drax, Yorkshire, and Middle Rasen, Lincolnshire, passed by 1124 to his eldest surviving son, <a name="cosubject_21088"></a><span class="headword">William (I) Paynel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1145<span class="mult">x</span>7)<span class="occ"></span>, who may also have secured possession of Les Moutiers-Hubert and Hambye in Normandy through him, and added further holdings in Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire to the Paynel honour. In September 1136 William's castle of Les Moutiers-Hubert was attacked by Geoffrey of Anjou, who opposed King Stephen. William, continuing the Paynel tradition of religious patronage, founded the Augustinian priory of Drax (<i>c</i>.1130&#150;39) and the Norman abbey of Hambye (<i>c</i>.1145&#150;7), and endowed the monasteries of Selby, Holy Trinity Priory, York, and St Stephen, Caen. William married first a daughter of William, son of Wimund, and sister of Robert d'Avranches, with whom he had four sons and possibly a daughter, and second Avice de Rumilly (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1176), daughter and coheir of William Meschin, lord of Egremont, and Cecily de Rumilly, lady of Skipton, and widow of William (II) de Curcy. With Avice William had a daughter, Alice, who married first Richard de Curcy in or before 1147, and second Robert de Gant, younger brother of Gilbert (II) de Gant, earl of Lincoln, in or before 1153. After William's death the cross-channel Paynel honour was broken up, and William's English estates, which had initially passed with his daughter to Richard de Curcy and then to Robert de Gant, were divided after 1154 between William's eldest two sons from his first marriage, Hugh (I) Paynel (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1179) and <a name="cosubject_21085"></a><span class="headword">Fulk (I) Paynel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1182/3)<span class="occ"></span>, and Robert de Gant. Hugh's portion included West Rasen, Lincolnshire, that of Fulk included Drax, and that of Robert was scattered in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Somerset, and Leicestershire. William's Norman estates were divided between Hugh and Fulk, the former receiving Les Moutiers-Hubert, the latter acquiring Hambye.<br>
<br>Fulk (I) was more interested in French affairs than those in England. He married Lesceline de Grippon or de Subligny (<i>fl</i>. 1198) with whom he had five or six sons. At some time between 1151 and 1153 he made an agreement with his brother Hugh for the partition of their mother's inheritance. Fulk attested over thirty of Henry II's charters in France between 1156 and 1183, campaigned with Henry in Brittany in 1166, acted as one of the guarantors of an agreement between Henry and Humbert, count of Maurienne, in 1173, and served as custodian of Alen&ccedil;on and La Roche-Mabille in 1180. Like his predecessors Fulk patronized religious orders. He helped his father to found Hambye Abbey and endowed the priories of Drax and Holy Trinity, York, and the abbey of Mont-St Michel.<br>
<br>Fulk was succeeded in Drax and Hambye by his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_52025"></a><span class="headword">William (II) Paynel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1184)<span class="occ"></span>. William married Eleanor de Vitr&eacute;, who brought him additional lands in Normandy and Suffolk, and was a benefactor of the abbeys of Hambye and Longues. Some idea of the value of the Paynel honour in England in the 1180s is provided by the exchequer accounts of the royal custodians to whom the lands were granted after the deaths of William and Peter Paynel (<i>d</i>. 1184), son and heir of Hugh (I) Paynel of West Rasen, when their under-age heirs were in the king's custody. With regard to William Paynel's lands, at Michaelmas 1186, 1187, and 1188 William Vavassor rendered account of &pound;108 6<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>. for the farm of the lands, which appear to have amounted to five and a half knights' fees, owing an additional 20 marks in 1186 for the stock of the manor of Broughton, Lincolnshire. As for Peter's lands in West Rasen, these were stated in 1185 to be worth &pound;42 a year if fully stocked, but at Michaelmas 1185 the sheriff of Lincolnshire paid in &pound;54 12<i>s</i>. of the issues of Rasen, and in the following three years rendered account of &pound;43 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. per year for the farm of Rasen.<br>
<br>William Paynel's heir appears to have died in infancy and his lands passed to his brother <a name="cosubject_21086"></a><span class="headword">Fulk (II) Paynel</span>  (<em>d.</em> before 1230)<span class="occ"></span> about 1188 or 1189. Although Fulk was a benefactor of Drax Priory, he also appears to have given priority to his Norman interests. This is reflected by his patronage of Hambye Abbey and by his marriages. His first wife was Cecily, daughter of Jordan Tesson and Lettice, niece and heir of Roger, vicomte de St Sauveur, and his second, whom he married in 1187 or later, was Agatha, daughter of William du Hommet, constable of Normandy, and widow of William, the son of Ralph de Foug&egrave;res. The second marriage appears to have brought Fulk land in Northamptonshire and Normandy, as well as five children, the marriages of two of whom, William and Lucy, strengthened the Paynel links with the Tesson and Vitr&eacute; families respectively. In 1199 and 1200 Fulk was present in King John's court in Normandy, and in 1202 received custody of the Norman castle of Pontorson. Between 1198 and 1203 he made an agreement with Roger de Lacy, constable of Chester, concerning the honour of &#145;Vallis Seye&#146; in Normandy. His association with du Hommet and the lordship of Chester emerges again in 1203 when King John, whose control of Normandy was then threatened by Philip Augustus of France, heard that the earl of Chester and Fulk Paynel were planning to withdraw their fealty and service to him. John travelled to the earl's castle of Vire, and on the following day Fulk and the earl appeared before the king and reaffirmed their allegiance to him. Fulk delivered his son to the king as a hostage, and the earl named William du Hommet as his pledge for good service and Roger de Lacy as his hostage. After John lost Normandy to Philip in 1204, Fulk continued to hold his Norman lands as a fief of the king of France and forfeited his English estates. He was one of the Norman barons who on 13 November 1205 drew up a record of rights that Henry II, Richard I, and they had in matters affecting the church. The bulk of Fulk's Yorkshire estates, including Drax and its dependencies, passed to Hugh (II) Paynel of West Rasen (<i>c</i>.1181&#150;1244), grandson of Hugh (I) Paynel and Hugh's wife, Nichole, and son and (<i>c</i>.1200) successor of Peter Paynel. Hugh (II) received them as compensation for the forfeiture of his Norman honour of Les Moutier-Hubert to Philip Augustus after his decision to remain loyal to John, and thereafter pursued his career in England and was a benefactor of Drax Priory. Between 1226 and 1228 the soke of Drax was worth yearly &pound;52 12<i>s</i>. and 120 hens and 700 eggs. Fulk was received into King John's favour in June 1214 and was granted the lands he had held of the king in England and other estates in Normandy as he had them when the king last crossed to Normandy. However, in June 1217 the sheriffs of Yorkshire and Leicestershire and the chamberlain were commanded to give seisin of all of Fulk's land to his brother Hasculf, a royal clerk.<br>
<br>The Paynels of Hooton Pagnell, descendants of Alexander son of Ralph Paynel, were an important branch of the Paynel family whose <i>caput</i> was almost certainly Hooton in Yorkshire. In addition to acquiring the lands of his brother Jordan, Alexander had probably received from his father, as a younger son's portion, the manor of Broughton. His marriage to Agnes, daughter of Robert, son of Nigel Fossard, strengthened further the Paynel links with the Fossards and the honour of the count of Mortain, and brought Alexander three sons and a daughter and control of land in Bramham, Yorkshire. Together with his wife Alexander was a benefactor of Nostell Priory, and also favoured Holy Trinity Priory, York. Most of his lands passed not later than 1153 to his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_59382"></a><span class="headword">William Paynel of Hooton Pagnell</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1202)<span class="occ"></span>, and amounted in 1166 to sixteen knights' fees in Yorkshire. William was a benefactor of St Peter's, York, Kirkstall Abbey, Roche Abbey, Nostell Priory, Gokewell Priory, Hampole Priory, the templars and the hospitallers. His wife, Frethesant, was possibly one of the two daughters of Agnes de Montecaniso, and with her he had a son, Alexander, who died in his own lifetime, and two daughters, Frethesant and Isabel. They married respectively <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65235/', "Geoffrey Luttrell")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54529/', "Luttrell family (per. c.1200&#150;1428)")</script>] and William Bastard, and were his coheirs. William's younger brother <a name="cosubject_21084"></a><span class="headword">Adam Paynel</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1166&#150;<em>c.</em>1205)<span class="occ"></span> was holding Broughton in 1187 by royal grant, and was probably the Adam Paynel who was a benefactor of Guisborough Priory. The Paynels of Broughton continued into and beyond the thirteenth century, and from one of their younger lines sprang the Paynels of Boothby Pagnell, Lincolnshire, who continued to 1595. The arms of the Paynels of West Rasen and Drax were argent, a bend sable.<br>
