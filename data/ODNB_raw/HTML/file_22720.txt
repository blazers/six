<span class="headword">Prescott, Sir  Henry</span>  (1783&#150;1874), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, son of Admiral Isaac Prescott (1737&#150;1830), who commanded the <i>Queen</i> as flag-captain to Sir Robert Harland in the action off Ushant on 27 July 1778, and his wife, daughter of the Revd Richard Walter, editor of <span class="italic">Anson's Voyage Round the World</span>, was born at Kew, Surrey, on 4 May 1783. He entered the navy in February 1796 on board the <i>Formidable</i>, with Captain George Cranfield Berkeley. In 1798 he was moved to the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>, and in 1799 to the <i>Penelope</i>, with Captain Henry Blackwood; he was present at the capture of the <i>Guillaume Tell</i> on 30 March 1800. In 1801, in the <i>Foudroyant</i>, he was present at the operations on the coast of Egypt, and on 17 February 1802 Lord Keith appointed him acting lieutenant of the brig <i>Vincejo</i>. In April 1803 Prescott was appointed to the <i>Unicorn</i>, in the North Sea, and in December 1804 to the <i>Aeolus</i>, one of the squadron under Sir Richard John Strachan which, on 4 November 1805, captured the four French ships of the line that had escaped from Trafalgar. In 1806 he was moved to the <i>Ajax</i>, and then transferred to the <i>Ocean</i>, flagship of Lord Collingwood in the Mediterranean. On 4 February 1808 he was promoted to be commander of the brig <i>Weasel</i>, and for the next three years served on the west coast of Italy. On 25 July 1810, at Amantea, in company with the frigate <i>Thames</i>, and the <i>Pilot</i>, he commanded the boats of the squadron in the capture or destruction of thirty-two store-ships and seven gunboats. For his gallantry then Prescott was promoted captain, dated to the day of the action. From August 1811 to June 1813 he commanded the <i>Fylla</i> (20 guns), on the Jersey station; and from 1813 to 1815 the <i>Eridanus</i>, in the Bay of Biscay. In 1815 he married Mary Anne Charlotte, eldest illegitimate daughter of his commander-in-chief, Vice-Admiral Philip d'Auvergne, prince de Bouillon, and they had several children. On 4 June 1815 he was nominated a CB. From 1821 to 1825, in command of the frigate <i>Aurora</i>, he was senior officer at Rio de Janeiro, or on the west coast of South America, under Sir Thomas Hardy. In 1822 he was chiefly responsible for the successful resistance of the British merchants to the imposition of a forced loan of $200,000 by the Peruvian congress. In October 1822 he was voted a testimonial of the value of $1500 by the British merchants at Lima, for his protection of British interests. From 1834 to 1841 he was governor of Newfoundland; a period of political quarrels and sectarian animosities which he was unable to allay.<br>
<br>On 24 April 1847 Prescott was promoted rear-admiral, and in June was appointed a lord of the Admiralty, an office he resigned in December to become admiral-superintendent of the Portsmouth Dockyard, where he remained until 1852. Prescott was appointed to the board at a time when the whigs were unable to find a suitable whig flag-officer prepared to contest a seat in parliament on Sir Charles Adam's retirement. His move to Portsmouth was inevitable. However, when Lord Auckland replaced him with Alexander Milne, then only a captain, he began the process of breaking the link between a seat on the board and active political support for the government in the House of Commons.<br>
<br>Prescott was promoted vice-admiral on 15 April 1854, was nominated a KCB on 4 February 1856, became admiral on 2 May 1860, and on 9 June following was retired with a pension. On 2 June 1869 he was made a GCB. He died in London, at his residence, 7 Leinster Gardens, Hyde Park, on 18 November 1874.<br>
<br>Prescott was an able officer, well suited to the administrative demands of colonial government and dockyard management. He lacked the political or personal influence for an active command afloat, but his services were highly valued. His belated GCB was for his work of the 1840s.<br>
