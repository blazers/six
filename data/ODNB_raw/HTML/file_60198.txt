<span class="headword">Jeeves,  Percy</span>  (1888&#150;1916), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, was born on 5 March 1888 at Common Side, Soothill Nether, near Dewsbury, Yorkshire, the son of Edwin Jeeves, railway porter, and his wife, Nancy Garforth. The family moved to Goole in 1901 and in the following year Jeeves left Alexander Street School and played in the Goole first eleven. Although he successfully answered an advertisement for a professional at Hawes cricket club, he was unsuccessful in a Yorkshire trial in 1910. R. V. Ryder, Warwickshire's secretary, noted his abilities and he joined the county ground staff in 1911, the year in which Warwickshire won the county championship. While waiting to qualify, Jeeves played for Moseley in the Birmingham league but was permitted to make his county d&eacute;but against the Australians (1912).<br>
<br>Jeeves's first full season for Warwickshire (1913), in which he topped the bowling averages, was &#145;nothing short of a triumph&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wisden</span>, 1914, 199). Three successive matches in August were especially significant. Against Worcestershire his seven for 34 were the best figures of his career, while his 86 not out against Yorkshire proved to be his highest score. In the third match, against Gloucestershire at Cheltenham, the spectators included P. G. Wodehouse, an enthusiast for the game. The writer had been casting round for a name to give to the fictional &#145;gentleman's gentleman&#146; whom he was creating in his mind. In settling on Jeeves he identified the cricketer with a figure who, from 1916 onwards, would have literary immortality.<br>
<br>Jeeves did well again in 1914 and <span class="italic">Wisden</span> was fulsome, seeing him &#145;as one of the great bowlers of the future&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wisden</span>, 1915, 123). He had been selected for the Players against the Gentlemen and his four wickets for 44 in the second innings had brought his side an unexpected victory. The season ended abruptly shortly after the outbreak of war on 4 August. In Warwickshire's last match, against Surrey, Jeeves clean bowled Tom Hayward twice and Jack Hobbs to help his side in a defeat of the reigning county champions. With his medium-fast away-swingers he took, in his career, 199 wickets (average 20.03) while scoring 1204 runs as a late-order attacking batsman.<br>
<br>Jeeves joined the Royal Warwickshire regiment and was killed in action in France on the Somme at High Wood, Montauban, on 22 July 1916. In the view of P. F. Warner he had been an England bowler of the future.<br>
