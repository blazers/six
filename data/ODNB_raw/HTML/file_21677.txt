<span class="headword">Peacock,  John Macleay</span>  (1817&#150;1877), <span class="occ">poet and Chartist</span>, was born on 21 or 31 March 1817 at Kincardine, Perthshire, the seventh of eight children of William Peacock, seaman (his mother is unrecorded). While his family was young Peacock's father was lost at sea, and the struggle for existence became severe. No formal education is recorded, and Peacock was sent to work at the age of nine, first at a tobacco factory, and afterwards at some bleaching works. Ultimately he was apprenticed as a &#145;rivet laddie&#146; on Clydeside, and boilermaking became his trade. Commercial fluctuations, and a strong natural disposition to travel, took him in the course of his lifetime to many parts of the world. As a young man he must have lived and worked in co. Cork, and the province of Cadiz in south-west Spain, as well as on Tyneside, Clydeside, and other shipbuilding centres in Scotland and England. Peacock was in the best sense self-taught, and his travels did much to broaden his knowledge and shape him as a clear and original thinker.<br>
<br>In both politics and religion Peacock was always radical. He was an active participant in the Chartist movement, and was sent as a delegate to the national convention in London (he published a &#145;Conventional Hymn&#146; in the <span class="italic">Northern Star</span>, 2 March 1839). He was elected a commissioner of the movement in May 1848. Afterwards, for many years, until his death, he was an energetic secularist. Peacock married and settled in Birkenhead in the 1850s (his wife's name is unrecorded), and for many years he worked at Lairds iron shipbuilding works, Birkenhead, where the <i>Alabama</i> was built; but this did not prevent him from openly advocating the cause of the north in the American Civil War. Dismissed for his militancy, Peacock began publishing poetry in the 1860s as an alternative occupation. Physically he was delicate, and, his occupation being arduous, his health failed in middle life; thenceforward he only earned a precarious income, chiefly as a news vendor. He died in Glasgow, where he was then living, of heart disease on 4 May 1877; he was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Peacock's poetry was highly valued by his friends and contemporaries. In Birkenhead, at the Shakespeare tercentenary (1864), he was considered the most fitting person in the town to plant the memorial oak tree. He wrote stirring and incisive political verse, as well as Scottish dialect material, contemplative verse, poems on topical events, and poems on shipbuilding and the industrial landscape. Three volumes of his poems were published in all: <span class="italic">Poems and Songs</span> (1864), <span class="italic">Hours of Reverie</span> (1867, which went into a second edition in the same year), and a selection of <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1880). The best of his work is in the 1867 and 1880 volumes (copies of which are held in Birkenhead and Manchester reference libraries). His work is also part of the Koehler collection of Minor British Poets in the University of California at Davis.<br>
