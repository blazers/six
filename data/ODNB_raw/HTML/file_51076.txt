</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Balint,  Michael Maurice</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Mihaly Bergsmann]</span>  (1896&#150;1970), <span class="occ">psychoanalyst</span>, was born on 3 December 1896 in Baross Street, Jozsefvaros, a residential section of Budapest, Hungary. He was the first of the two children of Ignac Bergsmann, a general medical practitioner. Both his parents were descendants of German Jewish families who had been fully assimilated Hungarians for only two or three generations. He later changed his name to Balint. At secondary school Balint became a voracious reader and haunted Budapest's public libraries. His younger sister by eighteen months, Emmi, studied mathematics and was at school with two other future psychoanalysts, Margaret Mahler and Alice Szekely-Kovacs; the latter became Balint's wife. As a young man Balint enjoyed skiing, ice-skated in Budapest's municipal park, rowed on the Danube, and was keen on boxing. His initial ambition was to be an engineer but his father disapproved and insisted, in 1913, that he enrol in medical school. He was conscripted into the army when the First World War started, serving first at the Russian front and then in the Italian Dolomites. He was sent home, however, following a serious injury to a thumb, caused while trying to dismantle a hand grenade. He returned to his medical studies two years later and graduated MD in 1920. In 1918 he married Alice, whose mother was Vilma Kovacs. Alice was an ex-patient, and then a pupil of Sandor Ferenczi; she later become a psychoanalyst, well known for her work on analytic supervision.<br>
<br>After reading Freud's <span class="italic">Totem and Taboo</span> Balint attended courses in psychoanalysis given in 1919 by Ferenczi and came under his influence. As the political situation in Budapest was still unsettled, and Balint's future uncertain, he decided to live in Berlin, where he worked as an assistant research biochemist in the laboratory of Otto Heinrich Warburg. Balint demonstrated his astounding energy and drive by pursuing his growing interest in psychoanalysis at the same time. Balint and his wife began their analytic training with Dr Hans Sachs and decided to study what was later called psychosomatic illness. This was the start of Balint's lifelong interest in relating psychoanalytic concepts to clinical medicine. He was soon working part time at the Berlin Institute of Psychoanalysis. In 1923 he also joined the staff of the First Medical University Clinic in Berlin's Charit&eacute; Hospital. After obtaining his PhD in chemistry and physics in 1924 Balint and his wife returned to Budapest, where their son Janos was born in March 1925. Balint spent two years as a research assistant in one of the departments of medicine at the University Hospital and both he and his wife went to Ferenczi for a further two years to complete their analyses. He became a full member of the Hungarian Psychoanalytical Society in 1926, was appointed a training analyst, and started in practice as a psychoanalyst at 12 Meszaros Street, Budapest, the headquarters of the Budapest Psychoanalytical Institute, where he and his wife also lived. Until the early part of 1926 Balint published papers on bacteriology and biochemistry. From then on he wrote on psychoanalytical subjects. The first of these were <span class="italic">Psychotherapy for General Practitioners</span> (1926) and <span class="italic">Psychotherapy and Psychogenesis of Physical Symptoms</span> (1926), which reflect the early development of his interest in the nature and content of the doctor&#150;patient relationship. In 1930 Balint played an important part in establishing the Psychoanalytic Outpatient Clinic in Budapest at Meszaros Street, and in that year he was appointed vice-director of the Budapest Psychoanalytical Institute. Ferenczi was its director until his death in 1935, when Balint became its director, serving until 1939.<br>
<br>Increasing political unrest in Hungary during the years 1932&#150;8, and the <i>Anschluss</i>, put Hungarian psychoanalysts in a very difficult situation. John Rickman, president of the International Psychoanalytic Association, advised all Jewish analysts to leave Hungary, and was instrumental in gaining entry into the United Kingdom for many of them, including Balint and his family early in 1939. They took up residence at 1 Mayfair Cottage in Fielden Park, Manchester, where, within a few months, Alice collapsed and died from rupture of an abdominal aneurysm, which they had both known she had. Balint continued to look after their son and in spite of his grief he also worked for, and obtained, the British qualifications which he needed in order to practise as a doctor in the United Kingdom. He was appointed consultant psychiatrist at the Manchester Northern Royal Hospital, and director of the North East Lancashire and the County Borough of Preston child guidance clinics.<br>
<br>Balint had a very difficult time until 31 July 1943, when he married Edna Henshaw, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Yates (<i>b</i>. 1903/4), a psychologist and former psychoanalyst, but this marriage broke down, and they separated in March 1947 and divorced in 1952. Early in 1945 he received the tragic news that his parents had committed suicide with lethal injections of morphine, when they were about to be arrested by the Hungarian Nazis, rather than face the certain fate of the gas chambers. Later the same year he moved with his son to live in London, first at New Grove House, Hampstead Grove, and after a short time at 7 Park Square West, Regent's Park. He worked as director of the Chislehurst Child Guidance Clinic from 1945 until he became a naturalized British subject in October 1947, after which he became a member of the British Psycho-Analytical Society, and started to practise as a psychoanalyst again. In 1948 Balint was awarded an MSc (Psychol.) by the University of Manchester for his medical sciences thesis on &#145;Individual differences of behaviour in early infancy&#146;, which was based on his researches into the patterns of infants' behaviour during feeding, and the mother&#150;infant relationship.<br>
<br>In the same year Balint was invited to join the staff of the Tavistock Clinic, where he stayed until his retirement from the National Health Service in 1961. He was then invited to join the staff at the University College Hospital, London, where he continued his work with his training-<i>cum</i>-research groups for general practitioners, as well as participating in the scheme which had been started in 1958 for Balint-groups for medical students.<br>
<br>Balint considered and commented on almost every topic of psychoanalytic research. He left a remarkable legacy of several major concepts in psychoanalytic theory, the first of which must be his recognition of the importance of the mother&#150;infant relationship for the individual's future ability to relate to others. This led him to the concepts of &#145;primary love&#146; (1952) and the &#145;basic fault&#146; (1968), while other contributions about the theory and techniques of psychoanalysis relate to regression and its use as a therapeutic agent.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Thrills and Regressions</span> (1959) Balint develops his belief that human emotions can be understood only in relation to an object, and he describes two very different types of human functioning. In the first of these, when personal security is threatened there is a need to hold on to something familiar and well known, something firm, a form of functioning which he called &#145;ocno philic&#146;; while, in states of emergency, the other type of individuals, whom he called &#145;philo bats&#146;, set a distance between themselves and those familiar things which represent safety, and tend to be self-reliant, and to thrive on independent, thrill-acquiring activity. As extreme examples he cites acrobats, lion tamers, pilots, mountain climbers, and skiers.<br>
<br>Balint's eminence as a psychoanalyst was recognized by his election in 1968 to the presidency of the British Psycho-Analytical Society. During his presidency he initiated the popular biennial English-Speaking Conferences of the European Psycho-Analytical Federation. He had also been president of the medical section of the British Psychological Society.<br>
<br>As important as his work was in the advancement of psychoanalysis, Balint will also be remembered for his work in his other main interest. After only a short time at the Tavistock Clinic he had been invited to join <a href="#cosubject_54722">Enid Flora Eicholtz, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Albu [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who was working for the Family Welfare Association developing techniques for treating people with marital difficulties, and then training social workers in their use. She became Balint's third wife on 2 January 1953. A seminar for training social workers was formed in 1948 and became the Family Discussion Bureau. Together they devised the case discussion seminar, a method of parallel therapy of the two marital partners by two separate therapists to help them deal with their problems. After further development and growing success it became the Institute of Marital Studies in 1968 (later the Tavistock Marital Studies Institute).<br>
<br>It was about 1948, possibly as a result of changes in medical practice brought about by the introduction of the National Health Service, that Balint returned to his earlier conviction that the essence of good medical practice lay in the doctor&#150;patient relationship, and he sought to develop a better understanding of the emotional problems encountered by general practitioners in their everyday practice. So it was that Balint's timely invitation published in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> (1952) for doctors to attend a discussion group seminar on psychological problems in general practice at the Tavistock Clinic was so attractive to so many. This led to the writing of his classic book, <span class="italic">The Doctor, his Patient and the Illness</span> (1957), which was translated into fourteen languages and proved to be extremely influential. Balint focused his attention on how the doctor's attitudes and approach had a vital impact on the patient's response and progress, so that he was able to show that<blockquote>the most frequently used drug in general practice was the doctor himself, i.e. it was not only the bottle of medicine or the box of pills that mattered, but the way the doctor gave them to his patient&#151;in fact, the whole atmosphere in which the drug was given and taken. (Balint, 1)</blockquote>It followed that as with any other drug, it was necessary to consider its pharmacology, its indications, dosage, limitations, the best ways of administering it, and its possible side-effects. Balint also demonstrated how doctors were limited by what he called their apostolic function, the ingrained attitudes and biases due to their training at medical school, in addition to the effects of their own upbringing and life experience.<br>
<br>Balint started seminar discussion groups with the Family Planning Association in 1952 for the treatment of psychosexual disorders. These were highly successful and the Institute of Psychosexual Studies developed from them. He was responsible also for setting up a workshop in 1955 for the development of brief focal psychotherapy with psychoanalysts from the Tavistock Clinic and the Cassel Hospital. Enid Balint reciprocated his earlier collaboration with her in her work with social workers and others, after his first few years organizing his training groups, and often joined him as co-leader.<br>
<br>Balint was the first doctor to undertake research into the psychological aspects of general practice in a highly scientific way. In devising his method for training doctors in recognizing possible underlying psychological aspects of their patients' illnesses he stated clearly and firmly that there was a great need for research in this area, and that teaching and research had mostly been in the hands of specialists of various kinds, but the research needed in this context could be done only in general practice. Balint-groups and societies were formed worldwide. In Switzerland the Foundation of Psychosomatic Medicine and Social Medicine has a keen interest in Balint's work. An International Balint Federation was also established.<br>
<br>For many years Michael and Enid Balint travelled a good deal to attend a variety of meetings and, frequently by invitation, to give lectures or lead groups. Although he was not known as a man who sought honours and awards he was happy with his appointment as visiting professor, and Enid's as associate professor, of the University of Cincinnati, Ohio, which they visited regularly from 1958 onwards. Balint's contribution to medicine was summed up by Lord Max Rosenheim, who wrote: &#145;By all reckoning, Michael Balint was a remarkable doctor and psychoanalyst, a man for all time, whose impact on general practice and on the understanding of the doctor&#150;patient relationship has been felt all round the world&#146;  (Hopkins, &#145;In memoriam&#146;, vii). During the last few years of his life, Balint suffered the effects of diabetes and glaucoma, with resultant severe impairment of his vision, and, although very few people were aware of this, he depended very much on his wife's guidance for his mobility. Balint died on 31 December 1970 while being taken to Southmead Hospital, Bristol, and was cremated.<br>
<br>Balint's third wife, known after a later marriage as <a name="cosubject_54722"></a><span class="headword">Enid Flora  Balint-Edmonds <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Albu]</span></span>  (1903&#150;1994), <span class="occ">psychoanalyst and welfare worker</span>, was born in London on 12 December 1903. She was educated at Hampstead high school and Cheltenham Ladies' College before entering the London School of Economics in 1922, and graduated BSc (Econ) in 1925, having specialized in public administration. On 25 March 1926 she married Robert N. Eicholtz, a professor of philology. She organized the Citizens' Advice Bureaux in London on behalf of the Family Welfare Association, helping to deal with the social and family dislocations which the civilian population suffered during and after the Second World War. In 1948 she began training in psychoanalysis under J. Rickman, and with a few of her colleagues set up the Family Discussion Bureau in order to train social workers who were needed for family counselling. She met Michael Balint in connection with this work; her first marriage having ended, they married on 2 January 1953 and thereafter worked closely together, co-authoring books and lecturing at universities and conferences abroad. After Balint's death she kept the movement alive and became honorary president of the International Balint Federation. She continued in private practice following her third marriage, in 1976, to Robert Humphrey Gordon Edmonds (<i>b</i>. 1920), a retired diplomat. She died on 30 July 1994, following a surgical operation, survived by Edmonds and two daughters from her first marriage.<br>
