<span class="headword">Vetch,  Samuel</span>  (1668&#150;1732), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 9 December 1668, the second son of the three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28174/', "William Veitch (1640&#150;1722)")</script>, a Church of Scotland minister of Robertson, Lanarkshire, and Marion Fairlie (1639&#150;1722) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45831/', "Veitch, Marion")</script>] from Edinburgh. In his childhood the family lived at Fallowlees, Northumberland, where William Veitch was minister, and from 1675 at Longhorsley. With his brother, also William (1667&#150;1700), Samuel was educated at Utrecht where, aged fifteen, he had been sent to join his father who had been in exile since 1683 from the anti-covenanter policies of Charles II. Both brothers later joined the army of William of Orange and participated in the invasion of November 1688 as members of the Cameronians or 26th regiment of foot. They fought at Dunkeld (August 1689) and later in Flanders at the battles of Steenkerke (August 1692)&#151;where William was wounded&#151;and of Neerwinden (29 July 1693). Having returned to Dumfries in 1697, where his father was then minister, Vetch (who had achieved the rank of captain) and his brother volunteered for William Paterson's ill-fated expedition to establish a Scottish colony on the isthmus of Darien. They sailed for central America in July 1698 with 1200 men, Samuel having been elected as one of seven council members to govern the colony. Arriving in November, Vetch oversaw the establishment of a capital, &#145;New Edinburgh&#146;, before opposition from the English and Spanish led to the scheme's collapse and the island's abandonment in June 1699. Vetch and Paterson now sailed for New York. They were followed in September 1700 by William Vetch, who had headed another, equally disastrous, expedition earlier in that year; departing the island for the second time, in April, William died off Jamaica <i>en route</i> for New York.<br>
<br>On 20 December 1700 Samuel Vetch (who adopted this spelling of his name on arrival in America) married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1763), daughter of Robert Livingstone, secretary for Indian affairs; the couple had three children, two of whom died in infancy. His marriage brought Vetch a comfortable place in New York society which he confirmed with his reputation for charismatic leadership, and a prosperous illegal trade with Canada. By 1705 he was living in Boston. There he began a new trade network under cover of a scheme for prisoner exchanges in which he acted as Governor Joseph Dudley's representative to the Canadian governor-general, Rigaud de Vaudreuil. It is probable that Dudley also expected Vetch to spy on Acadian defences and it was during this period that he gained a detailed knowledge of the navigation channels of the St Lawrence. However, in 1706 he was accused along with other Boston traders of simultaneously supplying the Acadians with arms at a time when Massachusetts traders faced frequent attacks from French-supported Indians. Tried by the Massachusetts general court, he was fined &pound;200 but acquitted in September 1707 following the intervention of the privy council in London.<br>
<br>During 1708 Vetch travelled in Britain where he sought to convince Queen Anne to sponsor his dramatic plan for the conquest of French Canada, as set out in his detailed paper &#145;Canada survey'd&#146;, submitted in July of that year. The queen's approval granted, Vetch was promised a substantial invasion force together with a colonelcy and governorship of the new territory on its acquisition. Vetch now travelled to Massachusetts to gather support among colonial officials with the help of the former governor of Virginia, Francis Nicholson (1655&#150;1728). However, by October 1709, with considerable colonial forces gathered at Boston, it was clear that the required naval support would not be forthcoming from a British government already heavily committed to war in Europe. With the plan abandoned and Vetch discredited in colonial political circles, Nicholson renewed the call for assistance during a visit to London in 1710. The result was permission for a limited assault on Acadia (Nova Scotia) in which Vetch took the role of adjutant-general subordinate to Nicholson, the expedition's leader. The attack on the Acadian capital, Port Royal, proved successful against a small French garrison, and Vetch was appointed commander of the settlement now renamed Annapolis Royal. But the limits of the expedition's achievements quickly became apparent. By late 1710 Vetch had witnessed the departure of Nicholson and many of the colonial forces, and he spent his first severe winter surrounded by hostile French Canadians, with a garrison numbering fewer than 500 British marines and New England volunteers. In January 1711 he unsuccessfully sought reinforcements before the council of Massachusetts in Boston. His reputation for illicit trading preceded him and his energies were instead spent denying accusations of illegal exchanges with the local Indian population. Vetch returned to find his garrison further depleted while the French and Indians grew increasingly hostile to the British presence.<br>
<br>In June, Vetch was requested to join an expeditionary force of ten ships of the line and over thirty transports secured by Nicholson to undertake the original proposal set out three years earlier in &#145;Canada survey'd&#146;. Vetch joined the force, led by Admiral Sir Hovenden Walker and Brigadier-General John Hill, at Boston and left for Quebec on 30 July in the role of commander of the New England forces. In view of his expert local knowledge Vetch was requested to navigate the fleet through the St Lawrence. Before he was able to do so, however, strong winds and poor visibility had scattered parts of the fleet among rocks on the northern shore of the Gulf of St Lawrence with the loss of eight ships and up to 900 men. Despite Vetch's calls to continue, the expeditionary force&#151;running short of provisions, facing continued bad weather, and having also suffered the destruction of Hovenden's flagship&#151;turned back. After reinforcing Annapolis Royal with troops from the failed expedition, Vetch returned to Boston from where during the winter of 1712 he continued to impress on Lord Oxford's tory administration the need for further assistance if the garrison were to be held. His cause was not helped when subordinates at Annapolis Royal&#151;among them his deputy Thomas Caulfield&#151;began their own correspondence with London in which they accused Vetch of malpractice, exploitation, and of planning the colony's destruction. In summer 1712 he returned to Annapolis Royal where he maintained control for another winter principally with the help of 200 Iroquois reinforcements organized by his father-in-law, Robert Livingstone. By this time Vetch had been replaced as governor by his former associate, and now adversary, Francis Nicholson. Though Vetch knew of the change (confirmed in London in October 1712), he remained in post until Nicholson's arrival in the following summer. The new governor made clear his intention of using Caulfield's complaints as the basis of a charge of maladministration against his predecessor. On 16 April 1714 Vetch left for England in an attempt to defend his conduct against earlier attacks and to seek financial reimbursement from Oxford's government.<br>
<br>However, Nicholson's governorship did not survive the change of administration following the Hanoverian succession. Vetch found a more sympathetic audience in the new whig government who dismissed Nicholson's and Caulfield's accusations as tory opportunism. In January 1715 he was reappointed as governor of Nova Scotia, though he did not return to Annapolis Royal, and only remained in post until August 1717, when he was succeeded by Richard Philipps (1661&#150;1750), under whose command the colony at last acquired the resources and fortifications it required. Vetch was equally unsuccessful in establishing financial security for himself and his family, who joined him in England in 1717. His final years were spent pursuing a settlement (he requested &pound;3000 per annum until employed) for his contribution to the establishment of Nova Scotia as a British colony between 1709 and 1715, and applying for vacant American governorships which he believed had been promised him by the government. Unsuccessful in all of his attempts, he was eventually imprisoned for debt at London's king's bench gaol, where he died on 30 April 1732; he was buried on 1 May at St George's, Southwark. He was survived by his wife, Margaret, who died in early to mid-1763, and his daughter, Alida (<i>b</i>. 1701), who married Samuel Bayard of New York, a nephew of Peter Stuyvesant, director-general of the New Netherland.<br>
<br>Samuel Vetch's contribution to the development of Britain's North American empire, if largely overlooked and under-appreciated during his lifetime, has since been recognized in favourable biographies by George Patterson (1885) and G. M. Waller (1960) which portray an innovative and dedicated imperial servant whose flair for commercial enterprise, if tarnishing his reputation during his lifetime, undoubtedly contributed to Canada's prosperity and importance to later British governments. A monument to Vetch was erected at Annapolis Royal's old fort in 1928.<br>
