<span class="headword">Strudwick,  Ethel</span>  (1880&#150;1954), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born on 3 April 1880 at 14 Edith Villas, Fulham, London, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67619/', "John Melhuish Strudwick (1849&#150;1937)")</script>, artist, and his wife, Harriet Reed (1856&#150;1941). Her father was one of the Pre-Raphaelites, and Ethel as a child met several of the group. She was educated at Queen Elizabeth's School, West Kensington, where she was a star pupil whom her teachers had &#145;to praise sufficiently without sounding fulsome&#146;  (Hughes, 175). She won the coveted Reed scholarship to Bedford College, London, and graduated with honours in classics in 1900. After two years as a classics mistress at the Laurels School, Rugby, she returned to Bedford College, where she graduated MA with distinction (1904), taught classics (1903&#150;13), and became head of the Latin department (1909).<br>
<br>In 1913 Strudwick was appointed headmistress of the City of London School for Girls in succession to Alice Blagrave, so embarking on the first of two headships whose tenure embraced the social changes from before the First World War until after the second. Almost immediately she was plunged into the problems of running a school in wartime. Her pupils were encouraged to make garments for the troops, work on the land, and raise money for the Red Cross. After the war she created a physics laboratory and introduced social work by the school in south London. Under her influence many of her pupils secured important posts in the new career opportunities available for women.<br>
<br>Out of forty-six candidates Ethel Strudwick was appointed high mistress of St Paul's Girls' School in Brook Green, London, in 1927. For the second time she succeeded a founder head (her predecessor, Frances Gray, having been appointed in 1903) and was faced with the task of preserving young but cherished traditions while moving forward. She herself taught a half timetable and, as at both Bedford College and the City of London School, generations of pupils were inspired by the lucidity and clarity of her teaching, enthralled by her diction, and absorbed by her scholarship, whether in the classics, literature, or the scriptures.<br>
<br>As high mistress Strudwick immediately initiated a programme to build a new science block, which was opened in 1933, &#145;the last word in equipment and comfort&#146;, she told parents at speech day  (St Paul's School for Girls, Strudwick box). Her philosophy of education found expression in a volume of essays by headmistresses, published in 1937, in which she wrote that &#145;schools exist to show how many possibilities there are, not to tie upon young shoulders precisely the same little packet of knowledge to take out into the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Head Mistress Speaks</span>, 113). Schools were to her not so much workshops as places of mutual trust and fellowship.<br>
<br>In 1939 the imminent prospect of war raised various options for the school's immediate future. Strudwick decided on an evacuation policy involving 183 girls going to Wycombe Abbey School in Buckinghamshire, where they spent the winter of 1939&#150;40. A small but influential lobby wished the school to go to Canada. At the height of the invasion crisis in May 1940, the high mistress canvassed parents, who voted by 155 to 44 to return to Brook Green&#151;though by the autumn term pupil numbers had shrunk to sixty-five. For the second time in her career Strudwick balanced the needs of education and the demands of war. She sought, with some difficulty, to get girls involved in work on the land, took her own share (with staff and pupils over sixteen) in fire-watching, taught in the air raid shelter, and stood &#145;as a bulwark against all that was uncertain, hazardous and fearful&#146;  (Harrison, 26). The exercise of authority&#151;whether in war or peace&#151;seemed to come to her effortlessly, and burdens were carried serenely.<br>
<br>School numbers quickly rose to 300 and at the end of the war Strudwick could tell the governors that not a day passed without parental &#145;letters begging for admission for their daughters&#146;  (St Paul's School for Girls, archives, report to governors, 30 May 1945). When she retired in 1948 she was hailed as one who had &#145;brought to her profession distinction and greatness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Paulina</span>, 2).<br>
<br>Strudwick was already a public figure, for whom retirement meant simply more time to give to her various interests. She had been on the senate of the University of London since 1921 (and remained so until 1952) and a trustee of the London Museum since 1934. From 1931 to 1933 she was president of the Association of Headmistresses and in 1937 she became the first president of the British Federation of Business and Professional Women. She was a governor of four educational institutions and became, in 1948, a member of the council of the Girls' Public Day School Trust.<br>
<br>Ethel Strudwick was no militant feminist; as a young woman she had &#145;silently disapproved from the Embankment&#146;  (Harrison, 14) of her suffragette friends marching to the Albert Hall. But she contributed to the cause by demonstrating the highest professionalism, setting a model for women's careers after the first &#145;heroic&#146; phase of the foundation of modern day schools for girls. Unlike many of the pioneers of the girls' school movement, she had herself undergone a formal schooling, and she set out to make this an enriching experience for later generations. Her devotion to liberalism was fundamental to her outlook: <i>liberalis</i> in her commitment to the concept of freedom, justice, and educational opportunities for all, and Liberal in her political affiliation. She served from 1943 on the Liberal Party council and, in 1949, became president of the Women's Liberal Federation, campaigning in the general election of 1950. Yet this tall, possibly austere, figure with a profound sense of obligation to society was not without humour. She could collapse in &#145;gusts of uncontrollable laughter&#146;  (Harrison, 33) in the theatre (to which she allegedly went on 1600 occasions), act in staff reviews, and struggle to conceal her mirth when rebuking a pupil for some misdemeanour. Leisure times found her walking with friends as much as 30 miles a day in the Lake District or the Dolomites. She claimed no aptitude for domestic chores but rejoiced when a Paulina commented that her education at St Paul's had given her something to think about when she did the washing up.<br>
<br>Ethel Strudwick's work was recognized when she was appointed OBE in 1936 (Edward VIII's only honours list) and advanced to CBE in 1948. She died at her home, 15 Leinster Avenue, Mortlake, Surrey, on 15 August 1954, and was cremated at Mortlake crematorium five days later. There was a memorial service in St Paul's Cathedral; &#145;a great lady and a great leader&#146;  (Harrison, 40), declared the preacher.<br>
