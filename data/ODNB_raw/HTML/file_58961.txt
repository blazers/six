<span class="headword">Brooke,  (Leonard) Leslie</span>  (1862&#150;1940), <span class="occ">children's writer and illustrator</span>, was born on 24 September 1862 in Birkenhead, near Liverpool, the second of the three children of Leonard Brooke (1825&#150;1885), manufacturer, and his wife Rhoda (1829/30&#150;1915), daughter of Henry Leslie Prentice of Caledon, co. Tyrone. His parents were both Irish. At Birkenhead School Leslie attracted the attention of the headmaster with his drawing. Severe typhoid contracted during a trip to Italy caused partial deafness that made Brooke decide to attend Birkenhead Art School (1880&#150;82) instead of a university. He went on to study in London at St John's Wood Art School (1882&#150;4) and the Royal Academy Art School (1884&#150;8; Armitage medal 1888). Afterwards he began to illustrate books and book covers. When in 1891 he followed Walter Crane as illustrator of Mrs Molesworth's annual children's story-book (for Macmillan) his future blossomed.<br>
<br>On 28 June 1894 Brooke married his cousin Sybil Diana (1870&#150;1957), the daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32094/', "Revd Stopford Augustus Brooke")</script>. Leonard Stopford was born a year later. Brooke produced <span class="italic">The Nursery Rhyme Book</span> for Warne, with an introduction and notes by Andrew Lang. It was released for Christmas 1897, &#145;illustrated by L. Leslie Brooke&#146;, the name he chose for publication. The illustrations are full of his trademarks, amusing details and visual puns, the puns often for adults as in &#145;This little piggy went to market&#146; with humorous newspaper and book titles and a reference to Circe. Edward Lear's <span class="italic">Nonsense Songs</span> followed. Published in two volumes, <span class="italic">The Pelican Chorus</span> (1899) and <span class="italic">The Jumblies</span> (1900), they were eventually combined in 1900.<br>
<br>In September 1899 the family had moved to the village of Harwell near Oxford for Sybil's health. When Brooke decided to write and illustrate a picture-book, Sybil suggested Johnny Crow's garden, a game first begun by his father for his brother Henry and him and carried on by Brooke with his own son, Leonard: the book became a classic. In April 1903 a second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37227/', "Henry Brooke")</script>, was born, and <span class="italic">Johnny Crow's Garden</span> (1903) was dedicated to Brooke's father and both boys. The book has humorous verses and details in each picture. Expressive faces and postures are augmented by subtle touches, again, with some designed to appeal to adults; on the Stork's &#145;Philosophic Talk&#146; page, one of the books is &#145;Confuseus&#146;, while another is &#145;Ludovicus Carrollus de Jabberwockibus&#146;.<br>
<br>Brooke next turned to fairy-tales for Warne. <span class="italic">The Story of the Three Little Pigs</span> and <span class="italic">Tom Thumb</span> appeared separately, then together in 1904. In 1905 <span class="italic">The Golden Goose</span> and <span class="italic">The Three Bears</span>, with its puns (&#145;Tom Bruin's school days&#146;, &#145;The bear truth&#146;), followed; all four were published in one volume, <span class="italic">Golden Goose Book</span> (1905), considered among his best. Meanwhile, <span class="italic">Johnny Crow's Garden</span> gained in popularity, and using leftover original rhymes along with old favourites and new creations, Brooke produced a sequel, <span class="italic">Johnny Crow's Party</span> (1907). Successful again, it assured his reputation. In 1908 the Brookes moved to a house in St John's Wood, London, where he continued to work.<br>
<br>The First World War temporarily halted Brooke's output. His mother died in 1915, and on 25 September 1918 his son Leonard was killed in action. The family moved to Cumnor near Oxford in 1921, building a house. In 1920 another major Brooke work, illustrated nursery rhymes, was published as <span class="italic">Ring o' Roses</span> (1922), containing his last illustrations of that decade.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A Roundabout Turn</span> by Robert H. Charles (1930) and <span class="italic">Johnny Crow's New Party</span> (1935) were his last books. Brooke died on 1 May 1940 in the London home, 28 Hollycroft Avenue, Hampstead, to which he and Sybil Brooke had moved in 1933.<br>
