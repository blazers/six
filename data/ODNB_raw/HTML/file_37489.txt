<span class="headword">Gresley, Sir  (Herbert) Nigel</span>  (1876&#150;1941), <span class="occ">railway engineer</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 19 June 1876, the fourth and youngest son and youngest of five children of the Revd Nigel Gresley, rector of Netherseale, Leicestershire, and his wife, Joanna Beatrice, daughter of John Wilson, and grandson of Sir William Nigel Gresley, ninth baronet. He was educated at Marlborough College and began his engineering apprenticeship in 1893 under Francis Webb at the Crewe locomotive works of the London and North Western Railway. Subsequently he was a pupil of John Aspinall of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway at Horwich, near Bolton; he became an assistant manager at their carriage workshops at Newton Heath, Manchester, in 1901, and works manager in the following year. In 1901 Gresley married Ethel Frances (<i>d</i>. 1929), daughter of W. P. Fullager, solicitor, of St Anne's, Lancashire. They had two sons and two daughters. In 1904 he was appointed assistant carriage and wagon superintendent of the Lancashire and Yorkshire, and in 1905 transferred to the Great Northern Railway in Doncaster as carriage and wagon superintendent.<br>
<br>In 1911 Gresley succeeded Henry Ivatt as locomotive engineer. He introduced more powerful general-purpose main-line 2&#150;6&#150;0 and 2&#150;8&#150;0 freight locomotives, followed in 1922 by the prototype Pacific (4&#150;6&#150;2) type for heavy long-distance passenger trains. In 1920 he was appointed CBE for his direction of war material production at Doncaster works.<br>
<br>In 1923 Gresley became chief mechanical engineer of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), following the merger of independent companies into four railway groups. He was responsible for the maintenance and repair of over 7000 locomotives, 21,000 passenger coaches, and 300,000 goods wagons, as well as for new design and construction, with control of some 30,000 workshop and out-station staff. The task of integrating the individual railways into the LNER was not easy. Over the first five years he introduced new locomotive designs and continued the development of the main-line Pacific type, incorporating detailed improvements pioneered by George Jackson Churchward of the Great Western Railway (GWR), whose work he greatly admired. This was characteristic of Gresley, who ensured that he and his design team were fully informed on the latest developments abroad and adopted ideas pioneered elsewhere if they were proved relevant to his needs. Thus from 1928 onwards he collaborated closely with the French engineer Andr&eacute; Chapelon, whose rebuilding of existing locomotives enabled their power and efficiency to be greatly increased. His great technical knowledge and ability were combined with thoroughness; all important engineering drawings were personally approved by him and all new features were tested on prototypes before being put into quantity production. While he was a commanding personality and very much the &#145;chief&#146; in his department he consulted closely with, and was advised by, his engineers before taking technical decisions. He also circulated &#145;third copies&#146; of all technical correspondence to his design staff to ensure that all were fully informed.<br>
<br>Gresley's earlier work on improved passenger coaches continued on the LNER and new trains were built with simple but attractive internal decoration and fittings. There were also new restaurant cars with all-electric cooking to reduce fire risks, improved sleeping-cars, and new types of high-capacity goods wagon. In 1934 the LNER investigated using high-speed diesel trains, as in Germany, for a London to Newcastle business service. However, tests showed that a faster schedule could be operated with a Pacific-hauled steam train of Gresley's comfortable coaches seating double the number of passengers. In 1935 the fully streamlined <i>Silver Jubilee</i> train, the first in Britain, went into service, averaging 71 m.p.h. between London and Darlington. In 1938 one of the streamlined Pacific locomotives, <i>Mallard</i>, attained a maximum speed of 126 m.p.h., a world record for steam traction. From 1936 184 heavy 2&#150;6&#150;2 mixed traffic locomotives were built and played a major part in main line operation.<br>
<br>While a strong advocate of improving the steam locomotive to the maximum degree possible, Gresley also tested diesel locomotives and railcars and realized that the future for main-line railway operation lay with electric traction when capital resources were available. In 1936 it was decided to electrify the severely graded cross-Pennine main line from Sheffield to Manchester and he was responsible for the design of electric locomotives for this service. From 1927, and later supported by his friend William Stanier of the London, Midland, and Scottish Railway (LMSR), he had advocated the building of a national locomotive testing station capable of handling the largest locomotives, and in 1937 work on the station was started at Rugby.<br>
<br>Gresley was involved actively for many years with the International Railway Congress Association as a member of its permanent commission and gave a comprehensive report on improvements in steam locomotives at the Madrid Congress in 1930. He was president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1936, the Institution of Locomotive Engineers in 1927 and 1934, and the Association of Railway Locomotive Engineers in 1926 and 1927. He served on a number of government committees, including those on automatic train control and on railway electrification. In 1936 he was knighted and awarded an honorary DSc by Manchester University. He enjoyed a simple life in the country best, being with his grandchildren and his dogs, shooting, and fishing. Gresley died at his home, Watton House, Watton-at-Stone, Hertford, on 5 April 1941, shortly before his intended retirement. He was buried at Netherseale, near Burton upon Trent.<br>
