<span class="headword">Cowie,  Mervyn Hugh</span>  (1909&#150;1996), <span class="occ">conservationist</span>, was born on 13 April 1909 in Nairobi, Kenya, the younger son of Herbert Hugh Cowie, settler, and his wife, Ada, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harries. His father was formerly the chief magistrate of Johannesburg, and his mother was a determined pioneering woman of considerable character and fortitude. After spending his childhood in Kenya, Mervyn was sent &#145;home&#146; to England to complete his schooling at Brighton College, which he entered with his elder brother, Dudley, in 1922. From there he went in 1930 to Brasenose College, Oxford, to read law, but his university career was cut short by his father falling seriously ill, necessitating his return to Kenya. He then went back to England and studied chartered accountancy. In 1932 he once more sailed for Kenya where he began working as an accountant.<br>
<br>On his return to east Africa, Cowie was shocked at the degradation of both wildlife and habitats that had occurred during his years away, and he set about trying to force the government to address the situation. His pleas falling on deaf ears, he took a drastic and somewhat bizarre measure. Writing pseudonymously to the <span class="italic">East African Standard</span> and other newspapers, he suggested all wildlife be eradicated in order to improve the country's farming. The public outcry at this &#145;radicalism&#146; jarred the authorities into action. Cowie was made an honorary game warden, and conservation became a major legislative concern. Throughout the 1930s he worked as an accountant, served as a district councillor in Nairobi, joined the King's African rifles reserve, hunted big game in his spare time, and founded the game policy committee to oversee wildlife concerns such as the control of hunting licences. In 1934 he married Erica Mary (Molly) Beaty, a former ballet dancer, with whom he had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 Cowie was commissioned into the Kenya regiment, and he served in Abyssinia, Madagascar, and the Middle East, rising to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. With the cessation of hostilities he returned to civilian life, determined to do all he could for game conservation. In 1946 he was appointed the founder director of the Kenya national parks service and succeeded in establishing the country's first game reserve, the Nairobi National Park. This was not without considerable, often vituperative, opposition from both die-hard colonials and native herders who had to surrender their grazing to the project. Undeterred, Cowie went on to create many other game reserves, including the internationally famous Tsavo Park and Amboseli Maasai Game Reserve. At the same time he considerably scaled down his hunting activities. In 1951 he was appointed a member of the legislative council, the colonial parliament. From this position of authority he was able to guide the development of conservation and at the same time foster the increase of tourism. From 1953 to 1956 his plans were temporarily upset by the Mau Mau uprising, during which he became director of manpower. Once the revolt was over he greatly contributed to the development of the tourist industry until it became the country's biggest foreign currency earner after coffee. For sixteen years from 1950 he was vice-president of the East African Tourist Travel Association. He was appointed CBE in 1960. Following the death of his first wife, Molly, in 1956, he married in 1957 Valori Hare Duke, formerly his secretary, and they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>With Kenya gaining its independence in 1963, Cowie's position came under threat, and in 1966 he was summarily dismissed with one month's salary in lieu of notice and no pension entitlement. His high-profile job, he was told, was being &#145;Africanised&#146;. For six years Cowie struggled to make a living as an accountant and as a senior consultant to the World Wildlife Fund, fund-raising mostly in London. Finally, in 1972, he returned to Nairobi as financial director of the African Medical and Research Foundation, which operated Kenya's flying doctor service. He retired in 1979 and, after a brief flirtation with Britain, tried to live out his years in Kenya. However, the rapid increase in violent crime in Nairobi forced him finally to leave his beloved Kenya for good, in 1989, and he settled near Saxmundham, Suffolk.<br>
<br>Always keen to share his passion for African wildlife with others, Cowie presented a series of BBC television natural history programmes, and served in a number of wildlife organizations. He wrote three books, of which the most famous, <span class="italic">Fly, Vulture</span> (1961), arose from his involvement with the 1951 film <span class="italic">Where No Vultures Fly</span>; it concerned his lifelong fight to establish game parks and counter ivory poaching. Considered to have been one of the most important conservationists of the twentieth century, Cowie was working on a fourth book at the time of his death from a heart attack, at the Ipswich Hospital, Ipswich, Suffolk, on 19 July 1996. He was survived by his second wife, Valori, and his five children.<br>
