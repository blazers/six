<span class="headword">Swan,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1605, <em>d.</em> 1671), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and encyclopaedist</span>, was baptized at Ickleton, Cambridgeshire, on 26 September 1605, the eldest son of John Swan (<i>d</i>. 1639), vicar of nearby Sawston from 1600 to 1639, and his wife, Sarah, daughter of Thomas Adams of Wisbech. In 1622 Swan followed his father to Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1626 and proceeding MA in 1629; he later described himself as BD. He was ordained deacon and priest at Peterborough in December 1629, and occurs as minister (probably curate) in Duxford St Peter, Cambridgeshire, in 1630. On 21 June 1634 at Sawston he married Frances Rudland (<i>d</i>. 1667).<br>
<br>In 1635 Swan published the first edition of his encyclopaedia, <span class="italic">Speculum mundi</span>. In dedicating it to the duke of Lennox, a contemporary at Trinity who shared the same tutor, he numbered himself among men &#145;of retired lives, and small-grown fortunes&#146;. The work was loosely based on Guillaume de Saluste du Bartas, <span class="italic">Premi&egrave;re semaine, ou, Cr&eacute;ation du monde</span> (1578), and subsequent editions, usually translated in English as <span class="italic">Divine Weeks</span>. He organized his material around the six days of creation, concentrating on cosmology, meteorology, mineralogy, zoology, and botany. Although essentially traditionalist, the work shows a critical spirit and a lively interest in recent discoveries and debates. On cosmology he generally followed Tycho Brahe, whose scheme he reproduced in diagrammatic form.<br>
<br>By the later 1630s Swan revealed himself as a pugnacious Laudian. It is not clear whether <span class="italic">A sermon pointing out the chiefe causes, and cure, of such unruly stirres, as are not seldom found in the church of God</span> (1639), preached at Sawston at the archdeacon's visitation on 19 September 1638, was delivered by Swan or by his father. However, the John Swan who wrote the violently anti-puritan <span class="italic">Profanomastix</span> (1639), which has stylistic similarities, was explicitly identified as the curate of Duxford St Peter. His <span class="italic">Redde debitum, or, A Discourse in Defence of the Three Chiefe Fatherhoods</span> (1640), written &#145;in confutation of all disobedient and factious kinde of people, who are enemies to both church and state&#146;, is in the same vein.<br>
<br>Yet Swan was not sequestered. In 1646 the county committee installed him briefly as interim following the ejection of the vicar of Duxford St Peter, George Chamberlaine. In 1647 Swan signed the Sawston registers for the first time as minister, and from the same year he was also rector of nearby Whittlesford, although both were poor livings, valued at &pound;20 and &pound;23 p.a. respectively in 1650. Either he had modified his views or he had influential patrons; he certainly counted the militant parliamentarian astrologer, John Booker, among his friends. Swan himself was keenly interested in astrology, both natural and judicial, and vigorously defended it in <span class="italic">Signa coeli: the Signs of Heaven</span> (1652), a sermon preached the day before the notorious &#145;Black Monday&#146;, the solar eclipse of 29 March 1652. The following year he published a chronology of the ancient world, <span class="italic">Calumnus mensurans: the Measuring Reed, or, The Standard of Time</span>, dedicating it to councillor of state Bulstrode Whitelocke. He compiled a series of almanacs published annually in Cambridge from 1657, and may have been responsible too for other titles, such as those ostensibly by &#145;Swallow&#146; and &#145;Dove&#146;.<br>
<br>It is not entirely clear how Swan was affected by the Restoration. He did not sign the Whittlesford registers between 1659 and 1662, nor the Sawston registers between 1662 and 1664. Thereafter, however, his title seems to have been secure. Following the death of Frances Swan in 1667 he married Ellen or Helen Rudland (presumably from the same family) at Pampisford, Cambridgeshire, in September 1669. She was still alive when Swan made his will in 1670, as were three of his children. Swan died in 1671 and was buried at Sawston on 17 March.<br>
