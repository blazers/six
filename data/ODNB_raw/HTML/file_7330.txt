<span class="headword">Dawe,  Philip</span>  (1745?&#150;1809?), <span class="occ">painter and mezzotint engraver</span>, has been confusingly entangled with an older P. Dawes, painter (<i>fl</i>. 1753&#150;1774), who may have been a relation. The earlier figure was a pupil of William Hogarth and exhibited theatrical and historical paintings as well as Hogarthian contemporary satire with the Society of Artists and the Free Society of Artists between 1760 and 1774. Some theatrical pieces signed P. Dawes were published between 1753 and 1764, one of them, <span class="italic">Captain Bobadil Disgraced</span> (1753), by the painter from his house on the corner of Orange Court, Orange Street, Leicester Fields, London. Later Dawes lived at Mr Brisbayne's in Green Street, Leicester Fields. The younger Philip Dawe might have been the son of William Dawe and his wife, Mary, baptized in London at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 25 August 1745. About 1770, having previously learned to engrave in mezzotint, he was a pupil of the genre painter Henry Morland and he befriended Morland's young son George. He was Henry Morland's principal engraver and scraped a number of his paintings in mezzotint, exhibiting ten with the Free Society from London addresses between 1769 and 1775, at first as &#145;pupil to Mr Morland&#146; (who lived in Woodstock Street near Bond Street) and later from Goodge Street and Greek Street. These, and other early works such as <span class="italic">Female Lucubration</span> (1772), are intriguing studies of servant maids and children in artificial light. Dawe also scraped a few portraits, notably of Methodist ministers and of actors, but most of his prints were genre, fancy, and historical subjects after a variety of artists including Richard Cosway, Richard Morton Paye, and George Morland.<br>
<br>Dawe's earliest prints were published first by Morland or by John and Carington Bowles, then by Robert Sayer. As well as scraping mezzotints for the Bowleses and Sayer, Dawe also designed a number of &#145;droll&#146; satires of current fashion, such as <span class="italic">The Macaroni Courtship Rejected</span> (1772), <span class="italic">A Hint to the Ladies to Take Care of their Heads</span> (<i>c</i>.1775), and <span class="italic">A New Fashion'd Head Dress for Young Misses of Three Score and Ten</span> (1777). Once again there is confusion with the older P. Dawes. <span class="italic">Courtship for Money</span> is listed in the 1769 catalogue as by Mr Dawes of Green Street but was published by Bowles in 1771 as invented and engraved by Philip Dawe. Later plates included a pair of <span class="italic">The Battle of Chevy Chace</span> (1791) after John Graham and Sawrey Gilpin, published by the Northumbrian Robert Pollard, and six plates after George Morland, among them <span class="italic">Children Fishing</span> and <span class="italic">Children Gathering Blackberries</span> (1788), published by William Dickinson. Dawe's marriage to Jane (<i>c</i>.1752&#150;1832) produced an artistic family: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7328/', "George Dawe (1781&#150;1829)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7329/', "Henry Edward Dawe (1790&#150;1848)")</script>, James Philip Dawe (1794&#150;1879), and a daughter, Mary Margaret Dawe (1785&#150;1871). He was still engraving in 1808 but is said to have died in 1809.<br>
