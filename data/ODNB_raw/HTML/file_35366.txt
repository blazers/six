<span class="headword">Palgrave, Sir  Reginald Francis Douce</span>  (1829&#150;1904), <span class="occ">clerk of the House of Commons</span>, was born at 26 Duke Street, Westminster, on 28 June 1829, the fourth son of the historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21157/', "Sir Francis Palgrave (1788&#150;1861)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth Turner (1799&#150;1852). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21159/', "William Gifford Palgrave")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21158/', "Francis Turner Palgrave")</script> were his elder brothers. He entered Charterhouse School in 1841 and left in 1845. He was articled to Messrs Bailey, Janson and Richardson, solicitors, of Basinghall Street, London, was admitted solicitor in May 1851, and entered the office of Messrs Sharpe and Field. On 1 August 1857 he married Grace (1832&#150;1905), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1718/', "Richard Battley")</script>, the apothecary. They had a son and five daughters, including Lucy Grace (1861&#150;1960), who married the architect Paul Waterhouse.<br>
<br>Through the influence of Sir Robert Harry Inglis and other friends of his father Palgrave was appointed to a clerkship in the House of Commons in 1853. From 1866 to 1868 he was examiner of petitions for private bills; he became second clerk assistant in 1868, clerk assistant in 1870, and from 1886 until his retirement in 1900 was clerk of the House of Commons. In 1887 he was made CB, and in 1892 KCB.<br>
<br>Palgrave's appointment as clerk of the house represented a further advance in the professional status of the clerkship, the foundations for which had been laid by his predecessor Sir Thomas Erskine May, Lord Farnborough. Even in 1886, however, it was still possible to contemplate the appointment to the most senior official post in the Commons of men with no professional experience there. Palgrave became clerk only after the post had been declined by Sir Henry Maine and Charles Lennox Peel. Though personally a strong Conservative, he did not simply reverse his predecessor's notorious readiness to give junior clerkships to the sons of Liberal fathers. Limited competition for posts was introduced, giving for the first time a preference to ability over connection.<br>
<br>In some respects Palgrave's clerkship was overshadowed by that of his remarkable predecessor. Yet although he lacked May's instinct for procedural development, there is no doubt of the sureness of his grasp of the practice of the house, particularly in the development of questions to ministers. The breadth of his capability was fully displayed in his editorial work (with Alfred Bonham Carter) on the tenth (1893) edition of May's <span class="italic">Parliamentary Practice</span>, when he undertook structural revision and expansion as well as updating of much of the text, both of which May in his later years had lacked the energy to tackle.<br>
<br>Most of Palgrave's other published works&#151;apart from a little guidebook to Reigate (1860; repr. in facsimile, 1973), where he lived until 1870&#151;had a parliamentary or historical connection. There were two editions (1869 and 1873) of illustrations of the history and practice of the house, and no fewer than thirteen of <span class="italic">The Chairman's Handbook</span> (1877), a guide to the conduct of public meetings. Palgrave was a particular admirer of Cromwell, whose life he wrote (1890; new edn, 1900). He contributed to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">North American Review</span>, and the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> on historical subjects.<br>
<br>From 1870 to 1900 Palgrave lived at an official residence in the Palace of Westminster. For many years after 1870 he spent his summer vacations at a house built for him at Swanage, Dorset. He had much artistic taste, inherited probably from his maternal grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27846/', "Dawson Turner")</script>, and to the end of his life practised watercolour sketching, at which he was fairly proficient, and he was for an amateur an exceptionally skilful modeller in low relief. He was a high-churchman and was churchwarden of St Martin's, Salisbury, where he lived in retirement. Palgrave died at his home East Mount, Milford Without, Salisbury, on 13 July 1904, and was buried in the cemetery there. A village cross at Swanage was erected to the memory of Sir Reginald and Lady Palgrave by members of their family.<br>
