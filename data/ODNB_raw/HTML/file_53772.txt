<span class="headword">Power,  (Frederick) Tyrone Edmond</span>  (1869&#150;1931), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in London on 2 May 1869, the son of Harold Power and his wife, Ethel Levenu, mildly successful entertainers, who in 1877 crossed the Atlantic to seek their fortune with American audiences. He formed the third generation of a theatrical dynasty which originated in the early nineteenth century with his grandfather the first Tyrone Power (1797&#150;1841), and continued into the late twentieth century with his son Tyrone (1914&#150;1958), the popular film star, and his actress granddaughters, Romina and Taryn, and grandson Tyrone jun. (<i>b</i>. 1958).<br>
<br>His parents did not wish Power to endure the hardships of life on the stage, so after a nominal education at Dover College until 1883 he was packed off to an orange ranch in Florida in order to learn the business of fruit-farming. He soon ran away and attached himself to the stock company of a theatre at St Augustine, with which he made his acting d&eacute;but as Gibson in Charles Hawtrey's <span class="italic">The Private Secretary</span> on 29 November 1886. With similar enterprise and aplomb he then proceeded to fashion a rewarding professional career for himself, gaining valuable early experience with two of the leading companies of the day. He had three seasons in 1888&#150;91 with the formidable Czech actress Fanny Janauschek, one of the last great tragediennes in the &#145;grand style&#146;, for whom he opened as Dominie Sampson in <span class="italic">Guy Mannering</span> (an adaptation of Sir Walter Scott's novel) at Montreal; he subsequently toured throughout Canada and the United States in tragedies, comedies, and melodramas. He then contrived to obtain a letter of recommendation from Ellen Terry. This he presented to Augustin Daly, the celebrated playwright&#150;director&#150;impresario, whose company he joined in May 1891 to play Sir Oliver Surface in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> and with which he remained associated until November 1898, while fulfilling occasional engagements elsewhere. Under Daly he took a full part in the manager's characteristically mixed repertory of contemporary plays and classics, accompanying him on American and European tours and playing a wide range of major and supporting roles. These included Posket in Sir Arthur Wing Pinero's <span class="italic">The Magistrate</span> and Brooke Twombley in <span class="italic">The Cabinet Minister</span> by the same author, Much the Miller in Tennyson's <span class="italic">The Foresters</span>, Frederick in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, Holofernes in <span class="italic">Love's Labour's Lost</span>, Antonio in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span>, Christopher Sly in <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span>, Caliban in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>, and the Host of the Garter Inn in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>. In 1894 he gave his first performance with the company in London, where in June he also took the bold step of hiring the Princess's Theatre to mount and assume the lead in his own play, <span class="italic">The Texan</span>; the venture was not a success. He then appeared in several productions with Herbert Beerbohm Tree, both on tour and at Her Majesty's, and acted in a command performance before Queen Victoria at Balmoral.<br>
<br>After returning to America, Power became a member of Minnie Maddern Fiske's company, appearing in Hermann Sudermann's <span class="italic">Magda</span>, <span class="italic">Frou-Frou</span> by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal&eacute;vy, and other plays, before securing a particular triumph at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in September 1899 with his characterization of Lord Steyne in <span class="italic">Becky Sharp</span>, an adaptation by Langdon Mitchell from Thackeray's <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>. In 1900&#150;02 he undertook an extensive tour of Australia and New Zealand, co-starring with his first wife, Edith Crane (whom he had married in 1898) in an astutely chosen repertory programme, which included <i>inter alia</i> dramatizations of Thomas Hardy's <span class="italic">Tess of the D'Urbervilles</span> and George Du Maurier's <span class="italic">Trilby</span>, H. J. Byron's comedy <span class="italic">Our Boys</span>, <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span>, and a current sensation, <span class="italic">The Only Way</span>, F. C. Wills and F. Langbridge's version of <span class="italic">A Tale of Two Cities</span>. This was followed by an engagement in June/July 1902 at the Lyceum Theatre in London as Bassanio in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, opposite Sir Henry Irving as Shylock and Ellen Terry as Portia. Back in New York, Power rejoined Mrs Fiske as Judas Iscariot in her production of William Winter's <span class="italic">Mary of Magdala</span> at the Manhattan Theatre in November, and played the title-role in a tour of Stephen Phillips's verse drama <span class="italic">Ulysses</span>, which opened at the Garden Theatre in September 1903. Power then acted as leading man to a succession of starring actresses: to Julia Marlowe in Maria Lovell's <span class="italic">Ingomar the Barbarian</span> and Paul Kester's <span class="italic">When Knighthood was in Flower</span> in 1904, to Mrs Leslie Carter in David Belasco's <span class="italic">Adrea</span> in 1904&#150;5, and to Henrietta Crosman in <span class="italic">The Christian Pilgrim</span>, a morality play based on <span class="italic">The Pilgrim's Progress</span>, in 1907. Other conspicuous successes in the ensuing years included his Robert Smith, the Drainman, in C. R. Kennedy's <span class="italic">The Servant in the House</span> in 1908, Brutus in William Faversham's production of <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span> in 1912&#150;13, and Abu Hasan in the American premi&egrave;re of Oscar Asche's <span class="italic">Chu-Chin-Chow</span> (music by Frederick Norton) in 1917.<br>
<br>After the First World War, with the advent of greater realism in performance, Power's romantic, somewhat rhetorical style of acting seemed increasingly outdated, and his stage work became more intermittent, although he repeated his Brutus in revivals of <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span> in 1918 and 1927, and in 1922 could still command such important roles as Sir Anthony Absolute in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>, and Claudius in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>. Turning to the cinema, he moved to Hollywood, where he appeared in numerous silent films, notably D. W. Griffith's <span class="italic">Dream Street</span> (1921), Henry King's <span class="italic">Fury</span> (1923), Raoul Walsh's <span class="italic">The Wanderer</span> (1925), and J. S. Blackton's <span class="italic">Bride of the Storm</span> (1926). He was beginning to adapt to sound, as in Walsh's <span class="italic">The Big Trail</span> (1930), when he died in Hollywood of a heart attack on 30 December 1931. By then his personal life had become increasingly turbulent, plagued by alcoholism and financial troubles. After the untimely death in January 1912 of Edith Crane, to whom he was happily married for almost fourteen years, he had contracted other, shorter-lived marriages, first to the actress Patia (Helen Emma) Reaume, with whom he had a son but from whom he was divorced in 1920, then, following a long, adulterous affair, to Bertha Knight, whom he married in 1921. Blessed with a tall, imposing physique, handsome features, a strong, resonant voice, and a natural dignity of bearing, Power was without doubt an accomplished actor in his prime. Though ultimately denied the accolade of greatness, he none the less made a distinctive contribution to the character of the American theatre while significantly enriching his own family traditions.<br>
