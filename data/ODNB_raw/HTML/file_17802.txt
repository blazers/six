<span class="headword">Maidstone <span class="st"> [Maydestone]</span>,  Clement</span>  (<em>c.</em>1389&#150;1456), <span class="occ">Bridgettine monk and liturgical writer</span>, was the son of Thomas Maidstone, esquire, of Isleworth, Middlesex, and his wife, Elizabeth. His father was a former yeoman-purveyor of Edward III's household, who sat as an MP for Middlesex on several occasions during the 1390s. Clement Maidstone entered Winchester College in 1403 and graduated <i>ad religionem</i>, entering the small house of Trinitarian friars at Hounslow. He was ordained subdeacon there on 20 September 1410, and deacon on 10 December of the same year. While still at Hounslow he came in contact with monks from the Swedish mother house of the Bridgettine order at Vadstena and, at some point between 1428 and 1432, transferred to the Bridgettine double house of Syon, founded by Henry V in partial expiation of his father's part in the execution of Archbishop Richard Scrope of York in 1405. He became one of the deacons, or theological instructors, of the community there, where he died and was buried on 9 September 1456.<br>
<br>Maidstone's reputation was as a liturgical expert. He saw the celebration of the divine office as the defining priestly task, and set himself to remove any grounds for criticism or scandal by an exact exposition of the form such celebration should take. His chief concern was to popularize and explain the intricacies of the Sarum use, and, in particular, to remove the discordances between the actual practice of the cathedral church of Salisbury&#151;&#145;which used to be the bright candle of the whole of England&#146;  (Wordsworth, <span class="italic">Tracts of Clement Maydeston</span>, 10)&#151;and of other churches adhering to the Sarum use. His <span class="italic">Directorium sacerdotum</span> was a revision of the existing Sarum ordinal which corrected errors and paid particular attention to the liturgical anomalies surrounding the feast of Corpus Christi. A later work, the <span class="italic">Defensorium directorii</span>, justified at greater length the practice set out in this treatise, and Maidstone also contributed to a composite commentary on the rubrics of the Sarum use known, in its printed editions, as the <span class="italic">Crede mihi</span>. In addition, Maidstone compiled an account of Archbishop Scrope's death, a topic of natural interest to the Syon community, known as the <span class="italic">Martyrium Ricardi archiepiscopi</span>, for which he drew heavily on the recollection of the Oxford theologian, Thomas Gascoigne. A composite volume of liturgical and devotional material, including Walter Hilton's <span class="italic">Scala perfectionis</span>, was copied by Maidstone himself and sent as a gift to Vadstena  (now Uppsala University Library, MS C 159).<br>
<br>Although his account of Scrope's martyrdom was notably hostile to Henry IV, Maidstone's writings in general fit easily within the project of ecclesiastical regeneration associated with the Lancastrian episcopate. This laid emphasis both upon the reformation and standardization of the liturgy, encouraging the adoption of the Sarum use throughout the province of Canterbury, and upon the importance of such acts of communal public worship as the feast of Corpus Christi in the defence of orthodoxy. The Henrician foundations at Syon and Sheen were to become forcing-houses of liturgical and devotional change during the fifteenth century. Clement Maidstone played an important part in establishing the intellectual traditions of the Syon community.<br>
