<span class="headword">Bourne,  Samuel</span>  (1834&#150;1912), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born at Windy Arbour Farm, Mucklestone, near Market Drayton, Staffordshire, on 30 October 1834, the third son of Thomas Bourne (<i>b</i>. 1804), a farmer, and his wife, Harriet <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dobson (<i>b</i>. 1802). He was educated privately by a clergyman at Fairburn, near Pontefract, Yorkshire, and about 1855 moved to Nottingham as an assistant at Moore and Robinson's Bank.<br>
<br>Bourne took up photography as an amateur about 1853; by the end of the decade he had acquired a reputation for the outstanding quality of his landscape work. In 1862 he abandoned his banking career and in October set sail for India, for what was initially planned as a two-year residence to exploit the growing photographic market in the subcontinent. He arrived at the hill station of Simla in the Punjab in March 1863 and formed a partnership with William Howard; by the end of the year they had been joined by another photographer, Charles Shepherd. With the departure of Howard in 1865, the business assumed its final form as Bourne and Shepherd. Within a few years it had become the most successful photographic business in the subcontinent.<br>
<br>By a natural division of labour, Shepherd undertook the bulk of the firm's studio work while Bourne took responsibility for topographical and architectural views. From July to October of 1863 Bourne travelled from Simla along the Sutlej valley to Chini and Spiti on the first of three major photographic expeditions. His second journey (March&#150;December 1864) took him to Kashmir, where verdant landscapes inspired some of his finest photographs, while the successfully achieved goal of the third expedition (July&#150;December 1866) was to photograph the source of the Ganges at the base of the Gangotri glacier. The resulting photographs of picturesque and dramatic landscapes&#151;&#145;of scenery which has never been photographed before, and amongst the boldest and most striking on the face of the globe&#146;  (<span class="italic">British Journal of Photography</span>, 11, 1864, 70)&#151;formed the basis of the firm's prosperity. Bourne's own accounts of his adventures, published in a series of articles in the <span class="italic">British Journal of Photography</span>, established his own reputation both as a sensitive interpreter of the Indian landscape and as a determined traveller willing to undergo hardships and danger to obtain the perfect negative. By the end of the 1860s the Bourne and Shepherd catalogue contained upwards of 2000 views, the overwhelming majority photographed by Bourne. The firm's commercial pre-eminence in India was consolidated by the opening of additional branches in Calcutta (1867) and Bombay (1870), while Bourne's photographic tour of southern India in 1869 further broadened the scope of the studio's coverage.<br>
<br>Bourne visited England in 1867; on 9 May, at the George Street Baptist Church, Nottingham, he married Mary Tolley (1844&#150;1912), the eldest daughter of Abraham Tolley, a silk merchant. His wife accompanied him back to India, where Constance Edith, the first of the couple's five children, was born in 1869. Bourne left India for good in November 1870, but his photographs continued to be marketed for many decades, and Bourne and Shepherd maintained its reputation as the most prestigious photographic studio in the subcontinent up to the Second World War (and, in much attenuated form, still trades in Calcutta under Indian management). This success was not only the product of the technical skills and commercial acumen of its principal photographer but also owed much to Bourne's ability to present a vision of India which coincided with, and reinforced European notions of, a picturesque and exotic East. An impregnable faith in the civilizing power of British rule, allied to strong religious convictions of a Unitarian character, further imbued his work with the pervasive sense of a moral purpose in photography, which &#145;teaches the mind to see the beauty and power of such scenes as these, and renders it more susceptible of their sweet and elevating impressions&#146;  (<span class="italic">British Journal of Photography</span>, 11, 1864, 69). The qualities of these Indian images place him among the finest nineteenth-century landscape photographers.<br>
<br>Bourne abandoned professional photography on his return to Nottingham (though he continued to practise as an amateur), entering first into partnership with his brother-in-law, James Boraston Tolley, and by 1877 establishing his own successful cotton-doubling business. He died of heart failure at his home, Brightlands, Clumber Road, The Park, Nottingham, on 24 April 1912, and was buried in Nottingham general cemetery on 27 April; his wife survived him by seven months.<br>
