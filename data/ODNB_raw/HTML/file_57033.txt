<span class="headword">Watts,  Isaac</span>  (1797&#150;1876), <span class="occ">naval architect</span>, was born in Plymouth. Details are uncertain but it is likely that he was baptized on 31 July 1797, the only son of William and Elizabeth Watts, and had two younger sisters, Ester and Marie. He was apprenticed to a shipwright and passed the competitive entry examination for the School of Naval Architecture at Portsmouth, which he entered in 1814. The seven-year course was divided between theory and practice and was both advanced&#151;it was among the first schools of higher education to teach calculus&#151;and demanding. He graduated in 1821 but, owing partly to post-war reductions in staff and partly to resentment of the new graduates by the older dockyard officers, promotion was slow. He was eventually promoted foreman at Portsmouth, a fairly senior post, in 1833 and remained there for some years. During this time he married Emmeline Anne (maiden name unknown; <i>d</i>. 1861); they had three daughters and two sons. In May 1847 he became master shipwright (or general manager) of Sheerness Dockyard at the age of fifty.<br>
<br>Only a year later Watts became an assistant surveyor, responsible jointly with John Edye until the latter's retirement, for the design of all ships. In 1851 he visited French naval establishments with the surveyor, Baldwin Walker, and the chief engineer, Thomas Lloyd. Their report on progress with the screw battleship <i>Napol&eacute;on</i> led to work being hastened on Edye's <i>Agamemnon</i>, the first British screw battleship to be designed as such. It was an exciting time: the screw propeller had been proved and there was a big programme of wooden screw battleships and frigates, both new construction and conversions.<br>
<br>During the war with Russia, Watts was responsible for the building of numerous novel ships, some with armour. After the war the building race with France resumed. In this period he designed some of the biggest wooden ships ever constructed, though with an increasing use of iron stiffeners and brackets, amounting to some 130 tons in a 120 gun ship. His big screw frigates were among the longest wooden ships ever built, for example <i>Orlando</i>, of 5416 tons, had a length of 366 feet overall. There were signs of weakness in these frigates, showing that wooden construction had reached its limit.<br>
<br>In 1859 news was received of the French ship <i>Gloire</i>, which was armoured but still with a wooden hull, and Watts was asked to design the counter. The board had asked for a wooden ship but Watts decided that a ship which would be long enough to carry the specified armament would only be satisfactory with an iron hull. There were many problems to be solved, particularly in the support and fastenings of the 4&frac12; inch armour, and a large full-scale section was built and fired on by heavy guns. Watts's design was sent to the Board of Admiralty in January 1859 and, by their direction, was passed to the royal dockyards and to experienced commercial builders of iron ships to see if they could offer a better design. Fifteen submissions were received and, in his report, Watts gave detailed explanations of why they were all inferior to his own design.<br>
<br>A reorganization in 1860 gave Watts the title of chief constructor with much the same duties and with a salary of &pound;900. When <i>Warrior</i> was completed in 1861 she was second in size only to the enormous <i>Great Eastern</i> and was much faster and more heavily armed than <i>Gloire</i>, while her iron hull made her more durable; she may still be seen at Portsmouth. Watts designed some variants on <i>Warrior</i> and was then involved in the conversion of the prototype turret ship <i>Trusty</i> before designing the first operational turret ships <i>Royal Sovereign</i> and <i>Prince Albert</i>, all before the better-known USS <i>Monitor</i>.<br>
<br>Like many great designers, Watts was an autocrat who had little use for discussion except with the surveyor, the chief engineer (Lloyd), and his own deputy, Joseph Large, who played an important part in the design of <i>Warrior</i>. <i>Warrior</i> initiated a revolution in warship design even though she was evolutionary in most technical aspects, such as iron hull, machinery, guns, and even armour. It was the combination of all these features which made her novel. Watts, Large, and Lloyd were all graduates of the School of Naval Architecture. Watts saw the navy through two technical revolutions&#151;screw propellers and armour&#151;and was created CB for his services. He retired in 1863 and died at 32 Albion Street, Broadstairs, Kent, on 11 August 1876.<br>
