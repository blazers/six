<span class="headword">Sellon,  (Priscilla) Lydia</span>  (1821&#150;1876), <span class="occ">founder of the Society of the Most Holy Trinity</span>, was born on 21 March 1821 in Hampstead, Middlesex, but brought up at the family country house, Port-y-seal, in Grosmont, Monmouthshire. Her father, William Richard Baker Smith (1791&#150;1860), son of Thomas Smith, receiver-general to the dean and chapter of St Paul's Cathedral, entered the Royal Navy in 1801 (lieutenant 1807), served in the Napoleonic wars, retired with the rank of commander, and on inheriting the property of his maternal aunt Sophia Sellon, assumed in January 1847 the name and arms of his mother's family. Priscilla Lydia Sellon, known as Lydia, was the third surviving child of his first wife, Priscilla Lydia White (<i>d</i>. 13 May 1823), who died when Lydia was little more than two. She grew up in a large family as her father married again and had eleven more children. She was educated at home by a Scottish Presbyterian governess. A lively and spirited young woman, she was allowed an unusual amount of independence by her father. When, in 1848, she wanted to go and work in appalling conditions among the poor in Plymouth and Devonport in response to an appeal by the bishop of Exeter, Henry Phillpotts, he gave her his support.<br>
<br>Lydia Sellon arrived in Devonport with only one helper, Catherine Chambers, the sister of a friend of her father, but quickly won the agreement of the bishop to start the Devonport Sisters of Mercy. For the rest of her life Miss Chambers self-effacingly devoted herself to assisting Miss Sellon, dealing with her correspondence and, as &#145;Mother Eldress&#146;, with the routine administration of the order. They wore plain black dresses with black wooden crosses. Theirs was not the first sisterhood in the Church of England. The Park Village Sisterhood in London, the Sisterhood of the Holy Cross, was founded in 1845, but it was absorbed into the Devonport sisterhood in 1856 and the united sisterhood took the name the Society of the Most Holy Trinity. Lydia Sellon was first known as the Lady Superior or simply Mother within the community. Later&#151;probably from 1852 when St Dunstan's Abbey, Plymouth, was built, largely at her own expense, as the society's main house&#151;she was known as the abbess and on occasion used a pastoral staff.<br>
<br>From the beginning Lydia Sellon was advised and guided by Edward Bouverie Pusey whom she had probably met through the Chambers family. He was her spiritual director, spent much time in her company, and went overseas with her on more than one occasion. He heard the confessions of many of the sisters and was a generous benefactor of the community. So close was their relationship that it led to gossip, and her brother eventually published a formal denial of any engagement between them. Pusey was an enormous influence on her, but she undoubtedly influenced him too. It was, for example, she who introduced him to Joseph Leycester Lyne, later known as Father Ignatius, and persuaded Pusey to take an interest in him. One of the sisters said Lydia was like a mother to Pusey. Another, however, who left to become a Roman Catholic nun, alleged Pusey &#145;had an infatuation for Miss Sellon which was very little short of mania. The woman had laid a spell on him&#146;  (Gill, 155).<br>
<br>Lydia Sellon's plans for the society were ambitious and invariably exceeded its resources. Within two years of its foundation she had established in and around Devonport an orphanage, a home for delinquent boys, two refuges for training girls for domestic service, an industrial school, six model lodging houses for poor families, five ragged schools, a soup kitchen, a home for old sailors, and a naval training school, as well as working among female emigrants. She later set up soup kitchens, almshouses, a nurses' home, and a convalescent hospital. One of her most imaginative projects was setting up a printing press to provide work for young women who might otherwise have been forced into prostitution. Mother Lydia had early seen the possibilities of a press as employment for women and had herself learned printing. The society's activities extended beyond Devonport and Plymouth. Houses were set up in London, Bristol, Manchester, Bradford-on-Avon, Norwich, Carnmenellis, and Ascot but some of the experiments were very short-lived. In 1864 Mother Lydia was able to realize a possibility for which she had made provision in the statutes of the society, that of the sisters' becoming involved in mission work abroad. A few were sent out to the Sandwich Islands to establish a school. In 1867 Mother Lydia herself made the arduous journey to Honolulu with three more sisters to choose a site for a permanent mission station. It was the first time any Anglican sisterhood had ventured into work overseas.<br>
<br>All the early sisterhoods were viewed with suspicion and hostility, because they seemed to threaten the family and because mistakes were inevitably made, given that there was no tradition of the religious life in the Church of England to draw on. The very name stirred fears of &#145;popery&#146;. The festivities for the laying of the foundation stone of St Dunstan's Abbey in 1850 were disrupted by a mob which pelted the sisters and clergy with potatoes and plates. The Society of the Most Holy Trinity drew more criticism than most, partly because of its association with Pusey and partly because of Mother Lydia's authoritarianism, exaggerated by gossip and rumour and by the allegations of one or two disaffected sisters and associates. Bishop Phillpotts was obliged to hold a public inquiry in February 1849 and, although he spoke warmly of Miss Sellon's work and character, in 1852 he withdrew from his role as visitor to the society. Bishop Blomfield of London tried to exclude her and the society from his diocese. Some of the clergy who might have been expected to support her, such as John Mason Neale, William John Butler, and Arthur Stanton, were in fact critical of her, especially of her independence of the parish clergy and her reputed ambition to become superior-general of all religious communities in England.<br>
<br>Lydia Sellon undoubtedly asserted her authority over the sisters and it is probably true that there were no formal chapters or elections of novices in her lifetime. The oldest sister at Ascot Priory stated, &#145;We are a despotic monarchy without a Parliament&#146;  (Gill, 153). Nevertheless it was no small achievement to establish the sisterhood and to organize and direct its many works in the face of a barrage of criticism and in an atmosphere of such mistrust. In 1852 pamphlets were published for and against her. She refused to defend herself in print but her father, who never wavered in his support of her, published in 1852 <span class="italic">Miss Sellon and the Sisters of Mercy: a contradiction of the alleged acts of cruelty exercised by Miss Sellon</span>, a full refutation of the allegations against her. A surprising tribute was paid to her by Wordsworth, who dedicated one of his last sonnets to her at the time of the bishop's public inquiry.<br>
<br>Much of the society's work was unseen and done for people who could not make their gratitude public. The work which received most recognition was the sisters' heroic nursing. A few sisters were sent to work under Florence Nightingale during the Crimean War but they had already distinguished themselves during a serious outbreak of cholera in Plymouth in 1849 which lasted almost six months. Mother Lydia immediately volunteered the help of her sisters, stating that &#145;the proper place for Sisters of Mercy is amongst the sick and dying&#146;  (Liddon, 199). One of the local papers acknowledged &#145;Nothing can exceed the zeal and devotion of this lady and the other Sisters&#146;  (Williams, 52). Another cholera epidemic in the East End of London in 1866 prompted her to write to <span class="italic">The Times</span> appealing for funds to establish an emergency hospital there. She took over an empty warehouse and staffed it with her own sisters and sisters from other communities. Father Ignatius and two of his Benedictine novices also helped. Mother Kate of St Saviour's Priory, Haggerston, met Mother Lydia at this time and described her as &#145;a most striking person, with commanding gestures, and a peculiarly imperative wave of a very well shaped white hand&#146;  (Warburton, 85). In 1870, when smallpox broke out in east London, Mother Lydia again sent sisters to help with nursing and the convalescent hospital at Ascot Priory came into its own. There were so many patients that some had to be accommodated in tents in the grounds. Mother Lydia was largely responsible for planning and directing everything although she was at the time threatened with blindness and so weak that she had to be carried about in a chair.<br>
<br>Lydia Sellon's health seems never to have been very strong. She had a stroke in 1861 which partially paralysed her for a time, and another in 1872 which left her right arm permanently paralysed. A third stroke when she was staying at Osborne House, West Malvern, Worcestershire, made her unable to swallow. She died there on 20 November 1876. Her body was taken to Ascot Priory, near Bracknell, Berkshire, and on 29 November she was buried in the graveyard there.<br>
