<span class="headword">Marshman,  John Clark</span>  (1794&#150;1877), <span class="occ">journalist and historian</span>, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18163/', "Joshua Marshman (1768&#150;1837)")</script> and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48964/', "Hannah Marshman, n&#233;e Shepherd (1767&#150;1847)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18163/', "Marshman, Joshua")</script>], Baptist missionaries, was born on 18 August 1794 at Broadmead, Bristol. He accompanied his parents to Serampore, India, in 1799, and from 1811 made increasingly important contributions to the various undertakings of the Serampore missionaries, including their expansion in 1816 of Bengali elementary schools, which he superintended and for which he wrote the textbooks. He helped to found and manage a savings bank. Marshman became in effect the business manager of the Serampore mission, and his own earnings helped to provide for a body of missionaries, catechists, and Indian Christians. But as the dispute developed between Serampore and the Baptist Missionary Society in conjunction with their missionaries in Calcutta, he became a particular object of their suspicion, until in 1837 agreement was reached for the BMS to take responsibility for the Serampore mission. Meanwhile Marshman managed the press and also a paper-mill at Serampore, for many years the only one in India; and he emerged as a significant pioneer of Indian journalism. He founded with his father, and edited, the first newspaper in Bengali, the <span class="italic">Sumachar Durpun</span>, on 23 May 1818 (continuing until 1841) and he established, also with his father, the first English magazine, the <span class="italic">Friend of India</span>, as a monthly in 1818, then as a quarterly. In 1835 he re-established it as a weekly, editing it until 1852; subsequently it was incorporated into <span class="italic">The Statesman</span>, which still continues.<br>
<br>Marshman published a series of law books, one of which, the <span class="italic">Guide to the Civil Law</span> (1845&#150;6), was widely used and highly profitable. The profits of his undertakings were largely devoted to promoting education, which he regarded as a forerunner of Christianity. He was closely associated with Serampore College for education in arts, science, and theology from its foundation in 1818 until his departure from India in 1855. Through the <span class="italic">Friend of India</span> he supported Bentinck's policy (1835) of funding English education, but also called for some continued patronage for classical Indian literature, and consistently warned against the neglect of vernacular elementary education. His advice influenced Sir Charles Wood's adoption of a grants-in-aid system in 1854. His concern for education was linked to his advocacy of the appointment of qualified Indians to responsible posts in the administration.<br>
<br>Marshman accepted the post of official Bengali translator to the government and he worked to promote the economic development of India, not least through articles and pamphlets: on the cultivation of cotton and tea and the mining of coal; on communications and public works including roads, the railway system, and the Ganges Canal; and on forest conservation. He became chairman of the Red Sea Telegraph Company. Generally he took the view that government and private enterprise each had complementary roles.<br>
<br>An earnest student of Indian history, Marshman produced the first, and for years the only, history of Bengal (1848), and he was long engaged on his <span class="italic">History of India</span>, which he finished and published after his return to England (1863&#150;7). He was critical of aspects of British rule especially in its earlier stages, including the permanent settlement of Bengal which, he argued, left the peasants at the mercy of the <i>zemindars</i> (landholders). But he commended the reforms of governors-general such as Bentinck and particularly Dalhousie, and believed British rule to be providential for India. Other historical and political works included <span class="italic">The life and times of Carey, Marshman, and Ward, embracing the history of the Serampore mission</span> (2 vols., 1859); <span class="italic">Memoirs of Major-General Sir H. Havelock</span> (1860); and the pamphlets <span class="italic">How wars arise in India: observations on Mr. Cobden's pamphlet entitled &#145;The origin of the Burmese War&#146;</span> (1853) and <span class="italic">Letter to J. Bright, esq., MP, relative to the recent debates in parliament on the India question</span> (1853).<br>
<br>Marshman's reading was very wide, and he was a distinguished oriental scholar. He studied Chinese, knew all the great Sanskrit poems, and gave much attention to Persian. He published an English&#150;Bengali dictionary (1828) and various Bengali textbooks; also articles in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society</span>, the <span class="italic">Calcutta Review</span>, and other periodicals. In England, however, he was not recognized. He was refused a seat in the Indian council, and although his services to education were, at the instigation of Lord Lawrence, eventually recognized by the grant of the Star of India in 1868, he had to seek occupation as chairman of the committee of audit of the East India Railway. He made three unsuccessful attempts to obtain a seat in parliament, for Ipswich in 1857, Harwich in 1859, and Marylebone in 1861.<br>
<br>Marshman was married twice: to Margaret Anderson in 1831, and, in 1846, to Alice Sparrowe, who survived him. He died at 2 Redcliffe Square North, Kensington, London, on 8 July 1877. His daughter Florence married Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick Bailey; their son was Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick Marshman Bailey (1882&#150;1967), Indian army, Indian political service 1906&#150;38.<br>
<br>Marshman was respected for the independence of his character, his strong convictions, and his knowledge of Indian affairs. Precocious as a young man, he matured as an unostentatious philanthropist with a remarkable range of interests and achievements.<br>
