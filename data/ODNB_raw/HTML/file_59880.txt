<span class="headword">Shakespeare, Sir  Geoffrey Hithersay</span>, first baronet  (1893&#150;1980), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at The Wilderness, St Peter Southgate, Norwich, on 23 September 1893, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56937/', "John Howard Shakespeare (1857&#150;1928)")</script>, minister of St Mary's Baptist Church, Norwich, and later secretary of the Baptist Union of Great Britain, and his wife, Amy Gertrude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Goodman. He went to Highgate School and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where his education was interrupted by the outbreak of war in 1914. He served as a captain with the Norfolk regiment in Gallipoli and Egypt, and returned to Cambridge in 1919, where he was president of the union. He graduated BA and LLB in 1920, and was called to the bar at Middle Temple in 1922.<br>
<br>Shakespeare intended a law career, but in March 1921 he was invited by Lloyd George, a friend of his father, to join his secretariat at 10 Downing Street. He soon entered parliament, winning Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, as a national (that is, Lloyd George) Liberal in the general election of November 1922. He lost the seat in December 1923 before he had even made his maiden speech, and for the next six years pursued a successful career as a political journalist on the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span> and the <span class="italic">Financial News</span>. He was briefly famous for predicting the early end of the general strike in 1926. On 16 September 1926 he married Aim&eacute;e Constance (<i>d</i>. 1950), daughter of Walter Loveridge of Codsall, Staffordshire, and widow of Commander Sir Thomas Fisher KBE; they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>In the general election of 1929 Shakespeare was returned as a Liberal for Norwich. He made his maiden speech in the debate on the address in July, commenting drily on the Labour government's reliance on Liberal proposals to reduce unemployment:<blockquote>I wish the Lord Privy Seal would pin &#145;We Can Conquer Unemployment&#146; as an appendix to the King's Speech. &hellip; I notice that he has already borrowed one or two ideas from it, but he will find out sooner or later that he will take the lot. (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 229, 1929, 126&#150;33)</blockquote>When the government resigned in August 1931 Shakespeare supported Ramsay MacDonald's National Government, serving from August until October as parliamentary private secretary to (Percy) John Pybus, minister of transport.<br>
<br>Shakespeare now regularly voted independently of the leadership of Lloyd George, and associated instead with the Liberals who coalesced around Sir John Simon. The Simon group was ready to give &#145;whole-hearted support&#146; to the government's emergency measures, even where these ran contrary to &#145;cherished formulas&#146;, notably free trade  (Simon, 171). When in autumn 1931, with a general election impending, the group transformed itself into a party, Shakespeare was in &#145;the forefront&#146;, alongside Leslie Hore-Belisha. As Simon later recalled: &#145;Few political organisations have ever got into fighting trim so quickly&#146;  (ibid., 171). A party headquarters, staff, and campaign fund were swiftly established, and forty-one <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96340', "Liberal National")</script> candidates took the field in October, of whom thirty-five were elected. Shakespeare, at Norwich, was among them; he held the seat until 1945.<br>
<br>Shakespeare was made a junior lord of the Treasury in Ramsay MacDonald's National Government in November 1931, and became chief Liberal National whip (the party changed its name to National Liberal in 1948). After the departure from the government in September 1932 of the Liberals led by Sir Herbert Samuel, following the Ottawa trade agreements, Shakespeare supported Simon in trying to preserve the independence of the Liberal Nationals. Though closely allied to the Conservatives, and virtually indistinguishable from them in the eyes of their erstwhile Liberal colleagues, they continued to regard themselves as a wing of Liberalism. They saw themselves as in government to defeat socialism while advancing social reform. Independent Liberals, they reasoned, could do neither.<br>
<br>In the reshuffle following Samuel's departure Shakespeare became parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Health, where he played a leading part in the national crusade against slums. In July 1936 he moved to the Board of Education, and in May 1937, upon Chamberlain becoming premier, he was appointed parliamentary and financial secretary to the Admiralty. In the next two years he saw first hand Britain's military unpreparedness, which he believed &#145;underlined the significance of Chamberlain's bid for peace at Munich&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 Sept 1980). To the end he loyally supported Chamberlain's foreign policy, writing after the war:<blockquote>No nation democratically governed can embark on a war and all it involves unless it has a cast-iron moral case which the nation accepts as conclusive. Chamberlain gave us that moral case by his policy of appeasement and his action at Munich. (Shakespeare, 186)</blockquote>Although Churchill thought well of Shakespeare's work at the Admiralty, particularly during difficult negotiations with the dockyard workers' unions in March 1940, he approved his transfer to the department of overseas trade in Chamberlain's reshuffle in April 1940. And when Churchill became premier in the following month Shakespeare moved again, becoming parliamentary under-secretary of state for the dominions. He was also chairman of the Children's Overseas Reception Board, in which capacity he made an extended visit to Canada in winter 1941. And in 1944 he visited South Africa as a member of a parliamentary delegation. After losing office in the government reconstruction of March 1942 he sat as a back-bencher until his defeat in the 1945 general election; he was created a baronet on 11 July 1942, and sworn of the privy council in June 1945. After the war he remained active in Liberal National affairs, serving as chairman of the party council in 1951.<br>
<br>Outside politics Shakespeare was involved in various commercial activities: he was a director of the Abbey National Building Society (1943&#150;77) and deputy chairman (1965&#150;9); president of the Society of British Gas Industries (1953&#150;4); and chairman of the Industrial Co-partnership Association (1958&#150;68). He also enjoyed country life on his farm in Hertfordshire. After the death of his first wife, Aim&eacute;e, in 1950, he married on 29 February 1952 Elizabeth, elder daughter of Brigadier-General Robert William Hare; there were no children. Shakespeare died on 8 September 1980 at his home, Great Ash, Lubbock Road, Chislehurst, Kent.<br>
<br>A modest man with an air of quiet detachment, Shakespeare was also resolute and determined. He was often at the edge of great events and recorded his impressions in his memoirs, <span class="italic">Let Candles Be Brought In</span> (1949). This includes a chapter entitled &#145;A close-up view of giants&#151;Lloyd George and Winston Churchill compared&#146;. Revealingly, Shakespeare considered Churchill the more loyal to his colleagues, and Shakespeare's own relations with Lloyd George were damaged by his joining the Simon group in 1931. When Shakespeare later agreed to an out-of-court settlement in a legal action that he had brought against Lloyd George, over assistance he had given in the sale of the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>, he received only a fraction of what he had expected: it was, recorded Robert Bruce Lockhart, a &#145;remarkable example of L. G.'s vindictiveness towards any of his henchmen who turned against him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 627).<br>
<br>Shakespeare, though, always defended the Liberal National secession, which he believed helped to secure the social reforms of the 1930s. He saw Liberal National support for the Conservatives in much the same light as he saw appeasement, as practical politics. Given this, it was almost inevitable that talks about a Liberal reunion during the war would founder. They broke up over the Liberal National insistence on preserving in peacetime a &#145;national front&#146; led by Churchill. Violet Bonham Carter, one of the Liberal negotiators, was not surprised at the outcome, and wrote of Shakespeare and his colleagues: &#145;None of them is the least interested in &#147;politics&#148; or ideas&#151;&amp; they all frankly admit that they lean to the right&#146;  (<span class="italic">Champion Redoubtable: the Diaries and Letters of Violet Bonham Carter, 1914&#150;1945</span>, ed. M. Pottle, 1998&#150;9, 284). In April 1947 the Liberal Nationals formally merged with the Conservative Party, through the Woolton&#150;Teviot agreement, thereafter maintaining only symbols of their former independence.<br>
