<span class="headword">Stewart,  James</span>, earl of Buchan  (1441/2?&#150;1499/1500), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the second son of Sir James Stewart of Lorne and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14646/', "Joan (Beaufort)")</script>, widow of James I, and was thus a half-brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14588/', "James II")</script> and half-uncle of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14589/', "James III")</script>. James Stewart's parents married in 1439 and he was probably born in the period 1441&#150;2 since his younger brother Andrew seems to have been born in 1443. The marriage provoked considerable opposition within Scotland, and after Joan's death (15 July 1445) Sir James made arrangements to leave the kingdom. On 20 November 1447 and in August 1451 the younger James Stewart was included in safe conducts obtained from the English crown by his father; the latter was killed at sea by Flemish pirates some time after August 1451.<br>
<br>James Stewart had returned to Scotland by 13 September 1456, when he was a member of James II's household. Although he had no place in the royal succession, he undoubtedly enjoyed a high social status in Scotland as a close kinsman of James II and James III, and his links with the royal dynasty ensured that he was an influential and sometimes disruptive figure in the politics of the Scottish kingdom for the remainder of the fifteenth century. Moreover, attempts to provide him with a territorial settlement suitable for the half-brother and half-uncle of successive kings of Scots involved him in a number of serious disputes with other members of the Scottish aristocracy. His relationship to James II and James III, combined with his kinship with the Beaufort family in England, was reflected in his later career as an active and wide-ranging diplomat in the service of the Scottish crown, employed particularly in Anglo-Scottish negotiations with Lancastrian regimes. Stewart's attachment to the Lancastrian cause in England may in fact have heavily influenced his behaviour and standing in Scotland.<br>
<br>In the final years of his reign James II (who died in 1460) evidently regarded his uterine brother as a useful and trustworthy ally. On 19 April 1457 the king granted &#145;his dearest brother&#146; the lands of Trabeath in Ayrshire. In 1459, although relatively young, Stewart seems to have been employed by the king as an envoy to Burgundy and the Low Countries. It may have been as reward for these activities that James II arranged his half-brother's lucrative marriage, shortly before 27 March 1459, to Margaret Ogilvy, daughter and heir of Sir Alexander Ogilvy of Auchterhouse, hereditary sheriff of Angus. The marriage brought Stewart claims to Ogilvy's extensive estates and offices, including the sheriffdoms of Angus and Banff, but also involved him in a long-running feud with his father-in-law's relatives, including David Lindsay, fifth earl of Crawford, who also claimed the sheriffdom of Angus. By 23 February 1461 Stewart was styling himself James Stewart of Auchterhouse.<br>
<br>In 1469, after the fall of the regime headed by Lord Boyd which had dominated James III's minority government since 1466, Stewart began to take a more prominent role in the governance of the realm on behalf of his young nephew. He became royal chamberlain in 1469 and between April and 17 September 1470 was created earl of Buchan. On a date before 10 June 1474 he was appointed warden of the middle march and assigned a 200 merk pension for his labours in that office. Besides these duties, Buchan also acted as a royal diplomat during the 1470s.<br>
<br>The governance of Buchan's nephew James III was increasingly disliked as a result of the king's clashes with his younger brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26453/', "Alexander Stewart, duke of Albany")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26484/', "John Stewart, earl of Mar")</script>, who were both imprisoned on the king's orders in 1478&#150;9. Although Albany subsequently escaped from custody and fled into exile, the young earl of Mar died in suspicious circumstances. The treatment of Albany and Mar, combined with the king's unpopular pro-English foreign policy and a general economic deterioration, undermined support for James III's kingship. Buchan and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26486/', "John Stewart, earl of Atholl")</script>, were left as the king's closest adult male relatives inside Scotland. Their quasi-royal status may well have encouraged others to view them as figureheads for legitimate resistance to the regime. On 22 July 1482 Buchan and Atholl arrested James III at Lauder as he mustered a host to intercept an English army which was heading north with the apparent intention of supporting the exiled duke of Albany in a bid to seize the crown. They imprisoned the king in Edinburgh Castle, but he was soon released and slowly tried to recover his control of royal government. In response, Buchan became involved in another plot to capture King James, this time in conjunction with the duke of Albany. The attempt to seize the king on 2 January 1483 was unsuccessful. After the failure of the conspiracy James III, under the terms of a settlement imposed on Albany and his supporters on 19 March, forced Buchan to resign the chamberlainship and the wardenship of the middle march along with his other royal offices. In addition, it was stipulated that Buchan should live outside the realms of Scotland and England for the next three years.<br>
<br>Buchan went into exile in the summer of 1483, although where he spent the next three years is unknown. He apparently returned to Scotland before 21 March 1487, and in October 1487 was involved in a serious armed confrontation in Edinburgh with Robert, Lord Lyle, and his supporters. The long-running feud may have had its origins in the persecution of Lord Lyle by Buchan in the months after Lauder Bridge, when the latter was highly influential in royal government.<br>
<br>In February 1488 a new rebellion broke out against James III headed by the king's own son, Prince James (the future James IV). In contrast to his behaviour in 1482&#150;3 Buchan remained loyal to James III, and seems to have been sent to England to seek assistance for the king about March 1488. His rapid return to a position of influence in James III's government may partly reflect his renewed usefulness to the king in conducting negotiations with the new English king, Henry VII, who was the son of Buchan's cousin Margaret Beaufort. In May 1488 the forces of James III and Prince James faced each other at Blackness. The king retreated from the stand-off, but Buchan was one of the hostages given over to the prince to ensure that James III would abide by the terms of earlier agreements. Buchan's status as a hostage meant that he did not take part in the battle of Sauchieburn on 11 June 1488, which saw the death of James III.<br>
<br>The new king's government summoned Buchan on charges of treason in August 1488. Despite the fact that he received a royal remission on 9 October 1488, he was still liable for some heavy financial penalties. He was a participant in the initial stages of a plot against James IV's government, which also involved Alexander Gordon, master of Huntly, and the English crown, in the early months of 1489, but Buchan switched his allegiance when his long-standing adversary Lord Lyle joined Gordon's insurrection.<br>
<br>After 1489 Buchan retained close ties with his kinsman Henry VII of England, and was involved in planning a number of improbable kidnap schemes. In 1491, for example, he and his associates had money from the English king to support their plan to deliver James IV and his brother into King Henry's hands. In September 1496 it was proposed that Buchan would kidnap the pretender to the English throne, Perkin Warbeck, who was then maintained at the Scottish court, and deliver him to Henry VII.<br>
<br>Buchan probably died in 1499 and was certainly dead by 23 January 1500. His wife, Margaret Ogilvy, survived him, and their son, Alexander, succeeded to the title. Buchan also had several children in a relationship with one Margaret Murray. On 20 February 1489 one of these children, James, received letters of legitimation and became the ancestor of the earls of Traquair.<br>
