</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lyall,  Robert</span>  (1789&#150;1831), <span class="occ">botanist and traveller</span>, was born in Abbey parish, Paisley, on 26 November 1789, the son of William and Janet (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Tassie or Tassin) Lyall. Probably educated at Paisley grammar school, he served an apprenticeship before matriculating in medicine at Edinburgh University (1807&#150;10). In September 1808 he bought a house in Paisley High Street but almost immediately went to Manchester, where he spent a year as house surgeon to the Manchester Royal Infirmary, specializing in burns and ophthalmia.<br>
<br>A letter read at the Linnean Society in February 1811 and six papers on plant irritability in Nicholson's <span class="italic">Journal</span> (1809&#150;11) reveal Lyall's talent for botany. At Manchester he made lasting friendships with Dr Peter Roget, the chemist Thomas Henry, and John Dalton, the natural philosopher; they all held senior positions with the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society to which Lyall was elected a corresponding member in January 1810, on his return to Paisley where he practised as a surgeon. He was a member of the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh in 1809&#150;10, became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh on 22 March 1810, and was appointed medical practitioner to the Paisley Town Hospital in 1811 or 1812. He sold his High Street property in 1813, and published a competent <span class="italic">Essay on the Chemical and Medicinal Qualities of the Candren Well in Renfrewshire</span> in 1814.<br>
<br>During 1815 Lyall went to Russia as physician to a St Petersburg nobleman, accompanied Dmitry Poltoratsky, a progressive agriculturist, to his Kaluga and Oryol estates, and became Countess Orlov-Chesmenska's house doctor, a position which he held four years. In May 1816 he graduated as a doctor and surgeon at the Imperial Medico-Surgical Academy, St Petersburg, with a thesis on staphyloma. As a foreign member of Edinburgh's Wernerian Natural History Society at Moscow in January 1817, Lyall joined the select Imperial Agricultural, Natural History, and Physico-Medical societies.<br>
<br>Some time before 1819 Lyall married. Little is known about his wife, Mary (Mariya); possibly she was Russian. In 1819 the couple visited England and Lyall conveyed numerous seeds to the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and discussed plans for a book on Moscow with publishers. From March 1820 he acted as General Nashchokin's physician at Semenovskoye, near Moscow. Between April and August 1822 he escorted a Marchese Pucci, Count Salazar and Edward Penrhyn to the southern Russian provinces. He returned to London with his family in August 1823.<br>
<br>In 1823 Lyall published his <span class="italic">Character of the Russians and a Detailed History of Moscow</span> (from the middle ages to 1820 and its rebuilding after the 1812 fire). Attractively illustrated, it included noteworthy descriptions of scientific societies, Moscow plants, edible mushrooms, Russian baths, and architecture. His outspoken criticisms of the nobility and the peasantry had precipitated his departure from Russia, and the book's dedication to Tsar Alexander was disavowed by the Russian vice-consul. Lyall replied to a particularly biased critique of his work, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> of 30 December 1824, challenging the anonymous writer&#151;John Barrow (1764&#150;1848)&#151;one of the founders of the Royal Geographical Society to a duel in February 1826.<br>
<br>On Tsar Alexander's death Lyall wrote three very frank articles in the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine and Literary Journal</span> (January&#150;March 1826) about the tsar (reproduced in <span class="italic">The Times</span>), Grand Duke Constantine, and Tsar Nicholas, stressing their despotism and the inquisitorial police state. Further anecdotes of Nicholas and publication of Lyall's memoirs of Alexander's reign, advertised in 1826, never materialized. The two volumes of Lyall's informative <span class="italic">Travels in Russia, the Krimea, the Caucasus, and Georgia</span> appeared in 1825. Critical as ever, he provides useful sections, among others, about Russian civil and military hospitals, the Orlov family, and Count Razumovsky's famous Gorenky Botanical Garden, near Moscow. Lyall's brief <span class="italic">Account of the Organization, Administration, and Present State of the Military Colonies in Russia</span> (1824) resulted from these journeys and was translated into German and French. His annotated pamphlet, <span class="italic">Medical Evidence Relating to the Duration of Human Pregnancy</span>, in the Gardner peerage cause at the House of Lords, reached two editions (1826 and 1827), gaining him recognition in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, which also printed his letter on the difficulties of determining pregnancy  (19 Aug 1826).<br>
<br>Lyall, a member of the Royal Asiatic (1823&#150;7) and Linnean (1824&#150;7) societies, succeeded James Hastie as British resident agent for Madagascar (1826), and was elected one of the Zoological Society's first corresponding members in May 1827 (from when his lithograph portrait by Gauci may date). According to his official journal he disembarked with his large family at Port Louis, Mauritius, on 2 October 1827 and sailed to Tamatave in Madagascar, where he met the island's King Radama I, before returning to Mauritius to await the travelling season. He arrived at Tamatave for his next visit in the following June, to be informed of Radama's serious illness; he hastened in July to the capital, Tananarivo, in the island's interior, which he reached on 31 August after the king's death. Queen Ranavalona refused to receive him as an agent of the British government in November 1828, but as the weather was unsuitable for travelling Lyall spent time at the capital, botanizing, and collecting natural history specimens. On 29 March 1829 he was arrested for &#145;sorcery&#146;&#151;offending the gods by collecting plants and reptiles. He was banished from the island and he and his family returned to Tamatave on 22 April and sailed back to Mauritius.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Institution</span> for 1831 reproduces Lyall's recordings of the Madagascan capital's weather between January and 25 March 1829, made with Adie's sympiesometer, Rutherford's thermometer, and Daniell's hygrometer. In a letter from Port Louis, dated 1 September 1829, to William Jackson Hooker, professor of botany at Glasgow University, Lyall bitterly regretted his disrupted plans to advance science, especially natural history, in Madagascar. Nevertheless, he shipped 450 Madagascan plants to Hooker and others to the Linnean, Wernerian, and Medico-Botanical societies and to his friend, Sir Alexander Crichton, in London. Two surviving catalogues describe Lyall's plants, which were incorporated with Hooker's collections in the herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew after Hooker's death in 1865. Other Madagascan plants collected by Lyall are at Edinburgh, New York, and in Mauritius; specimens from Mauritius are also at Kew, while some from St Helena are preserved in Berlin. Altogether fourteen species of Madagascan plants have been named after Lyall. In April 1830 he sent a box of untraced Madagascan minerals, with an extant catalogue, to Professor William Buckland (1784&#150;1856) for the Geological Society of London. Lyall had prepared an account for the press from his private journal about his experiences at the Madagascan capital, but died on 23 May 1831 at Port Louis, Mauritius. His death certificate gives the cause as a malarial fever, contracted in Madagascar during 1828.<br>
