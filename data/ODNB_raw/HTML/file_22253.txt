<span class="headword">Pigott,  Harriet</span>  (1775&#150;1846), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was the youngest daughter of William Pigott, rector of Chetwynd, Shropshire, and his wife, Arabella Mytton (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1779). Her two paternal uncles were notorious figures in later eighteenth-century society. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22250/', "Charles Pigott")</script>, the younger of the two [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22256/', "Pigott, Robert")</script>], was the author of <span class="italic">The Jockey Club</span> and <span class="italic">The Female Jockey Club</span>, scandalous accounts of the self-indulgent lives of the aristocracy, while the elder, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22256/', "Robert Pigott")</script>, became a passionate convert to French enlightenment ideas during his travels on the continent. Harriet Pigott, who claimed to trace her ancestry back to the Norman conquest and was intensely proud of her family, seemed to disapprove almost equally of her uncle's politics and his dissipation of the family estates while following his republican enthusiasms. Despite this dislike of later eighteenth-century radicalism, she was a strong admirer of Charles James Fox and claimed to be a friend and one-time schoolmate of his illegitimate daughter Henrietta Willoughby.<br>
<br>Pigott's first publication, <span class="italic">The Private Correspondence of a Woman of Fashion</span> (2 vols.), appeared anonymously in 1832. The book, a collection of what are supposedly the letters Pigott wrote during a residence in France from the summer of 1814 to December 1815 as well as during travels in England in 1816, seems calculated to appeal to a taste for gossipy anecdote, as it documents her encounters with the titled and the famous. Yet if her version of events is trustworthy, Pigott was also a witness of many of the dramatic historic events of that time, including the return of Napoleon to Paris and the days following the battle of Waterloo in Brussels. A glimpse of Napoleon, she reports, left her &#145;dazzled, as if beholding a supernatural being&#146;, albeit one marked by &#145;something of the Satanic&#146;  (Pigott, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.331&#150;2). While horrified by the reports of Waterloo and the sight of the wounded soldiers, she nevertheless suggests the speed with which the battlefield was transformed into a tourist site, as, within two weeks of the battle, she reports that she and some companions were heading there for a picnic, picking up buttons and letters as souvenirs. Pigott's account of England in 1816 includes descriptions of the Ladies of Llangollen, of Sarah Siddons performing Shakespeare, and of Princess Charlotte and Prince Leopold attending a play together shortly after their marriage. <span class="italic">Records of Real Life in the Palace and the Cottage</span> (3 vols., 1839), Pigott's next publication, appeared under her name and continued her epistolary autobiography, describing her lengthy stays in the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Germany, as well as in France. While working on this second collection, Pigott persuaded John Galt, whom she met late in his life and visited frequently when she settled near him in Scotland in 1838, to revise the volumes for her. According to the unsigned introduction of <span class="italic">Records of Real Life</span>, Pigott &#145;cast a cheering beam over [Galt's] monotonous days&#146;  (1.vii), and she later wrote a preface for Galt's final collection of poems (<span class="italic">The Demon of Destiny</span>, 1840), in which she gave him credit for &#145;the extensive circulation&#146; of her own book. Galt's critics have not been kind to Pigott, one complaining about the &#145;selfish importunity&#146; with which she &#145;press[ed] her literary concerns&#146;  (Gordon, 106) on a dying man, and another dismissing her as &#145;a pedantic spinster who thrust herself upon Galt&#146;  (Aldrich, 21). Yet Pigott's interest in Galt's writing was genuine enough for her to begin work on a biography of him following his death, although she abandoned the book when she was forestalled by another biographer in 1841 (the manuscript is now in the Bodleian Library). Her final work, a brief, romantic fairy tale called <span class="italic">The Three Springs of Beauty</span>, was published in 1844. While a lively chronicler of Regency and early Victorian high society, Pigott never achieved either as much success or notoriety in that genre as did her friend and contemporary Lady Charlotte Bury, and her books did not receive any lasting attention. She died, unmarried, in Geneva in July 1846.<br>
