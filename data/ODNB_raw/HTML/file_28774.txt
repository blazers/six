<span class="headword">Warren,  Charles</span>  (1766/7&#150;1823), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was the eldest son of Bartholomew and Hannah Warren. The family appears to have moved to London before the baptism of David Bartholomew, a younger brother of Charles, on 15 October 1769 at St Martin-in-the-Fields. The name Bartholomew Warren occurs most frequently in Cornwall, which may be Warren's native county. Little is known of his early life, although his obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> mentions engraving on copper calico printing rollers as his earliest employment; he is also thought to have worked for gunsmiths. He married Elizabeth about 1787 (since their daughter Elizabeth was born on 20 March 1788).<br>
<br>Soon afterwards Warren began a long association with London booksellers, notably Charles Cooke, by engraving plates for popular works; the earliest were portraits of Fox, Pitt, and Thurlow, produced for <span class="italic">The Senator, or, Clarendon's Parliamentary Chronicle</span>, the first volume of which was issued in 1790. Many editions of literary works carried Warren's engravings in the last decade of the eighteenth century, and from 1803 he engraved for John Sharpe's series of classics. Later he engraved the plates for William Ottley's <span class="italic">Engravings of the &hellip; Marquis of Stafford's Collection of Pictures</span> (1814&#150;18) and after Robert Smirke for a celebrated edition of Cervantes' <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> (1818). His reputation was made by two plates engraved for John Boydell's edition of his <span class="italic">Shakspeare</span> (1803), which probably led to Warren's election&#151;on the proposal of the mezzotint engraver Valentine Green&#151;to the Society of Arts on 31 October 1804; he engraved nine frontispiece portraits for the society's <span class="italic">Transactions</span> in 1805 and between 1813 and 1821. He was elected a member of the Committee of Polite Arts on 22 March 1805 and served until his death, being one of its two chairmen in 1805&#150;7 and 1822&#150;3. He was also elected a governor of the short-lived Society of Engravers (founded in 1802); it was succeeded by the Artists' Annuity Fund, established in 1810, of which Warren was president from 1812 to 1815. He was also a director and exhibitor of twenty plates at W. B. Cooke's exhibition of engravings in 1821. His style of copper-engraving was well adapted to his subjects and his execution was meticulous.<br>
<br>After the Plymouth Stock Bank had suffered losses from forgery, Warren was asked to design and execute a vignette for their notes. This resulted in his being requested to give evidence to the committee on forgery, set up by the Society of Arts: here, on 15 April 1818, he supported J. T. Barber Beaumont's campaign to persuade the Bank of England to use steel plates for printing their notes. To demonstrate his views, Warren engraved a head of Minerva on a decarbonized saw blade in May 1818, maintaining that the process of case hardening blocks of steel was unnecessary and potentially damaging. He devoted the next four years to further experiments and, with the aid of his platemaker Richard Hughes, finally produced a satisfactory technique, which was first demonstrated publicly in the frontispiece and engraved title-page for an edition of Philip Doddridge's <span class="italic">Rise and Progress of Religion</span> (May 1822). He thus made steel plates acceptable to engravers in general, for which the Society of Arts awarded him their gold medal in 1823. He died before he could receive it, and it was presented to his brother Ambrose by the duke of Sussex in May 1823. Warren was assisted by Samuel Davenport, Thomas Fairland, Joseph Phelps, and Henry Chawner Shenton, who married Warren's daughter Mary Ann on 9 March 1824 at St Pancras Old Church.<br>
<br>Warren died suddenly of heart disease in the middle of a conversation at East Hill, Wandsworth, on 21 April 1823; he was buried in St Sepulchre Church, Newgate Street, on 1 May. His many friends found him sociable, generous, and of a cheerful disposition, although he was inclined to be improvident. His will, dated 8 September 1816, is a key document which establishes his relationship as brother to both Ambrose William and William Warren. It makes no mention of his wife, who must have predeceased him, but names two daughters, Elizabeth, who married the engraver Luke Clennell in 1809 and died in 1819, and Mary Ann, who alone survived him and inherited most of his property. His brothers were left engravings, a complete set being bequeathed to Ambrose.<br>

<a name="cosubject_28772"></a><span class="headword">Ambrose William Warren</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1780, <em>d.</em> 1856), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, the third son of Bartholomew and Hannah Warren, was baptized on 27 October 1780 at St Andrew's, Holborn. It is likely that he worked and was trained by his brother Charles (who is wrongly described as his father in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>); their plates appear in the same publications. Among his earliest work was a portrait of Sir Roger Curtis, after C. M. Metz, published on 26 June 1802, and plates for Alexander Pope's <span class="italic">Essay on Man</span> (1819). Cervantes' <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> (1818), Horace Walpole's <span class="italic">Castle of Otranto</span> (with Clara Reeves's <span class="italic">The Old English Baron</span>, 1817), Lord Byron's <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1816), William Ottley's <span class="italic">Engravings of the Marquis of Stafford's Pictures</span> (1814&#150;18) and Edward Young's <span class="italic">Night Thoughts</span> (1811) are representative and were shown at W. B. Cooke's exhibition of engravings in 1821. He also engraved plates for the Society of Arts <span class="italic">Transactions</span> (1816&#150;19) and for the <span class="italic">Description of the Collection of Ancient Marbles in the British Museum</span> (1812&#150;45), by T. Combe and others. He married Elizabeth Rebecca Callow on 12 May 1810 at St Pancras Old Church; their daughter Mary Ann was baptized on 13 May 1816 at St Andrew's, Holborn. An Edmund Warren, possibly a son, was present at Ambrose's death. Ambrose Warren's steel plates included two for Walpole's <span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painting</span> (1827), many for various editions of Walter Scott's works, the annual <span class="italic">The Gem</span> (1830&#150;31), several editions of David Hume and Tobias Smollett's <span class="italic">History of England</span> from 1834&#150;6 onwards, and a series of royal portraits from Alfred the Great to George II. His most important single plates are <span class="italic">The Beggar's Petition</span>, after W. F. Witherington (1827), and <span class="italic">The New Coat</span>, after David Wilkie (1832). His plates, mostly well engraved, were signed variously &#145;A. W. Warren&#146;, &#145;A. Warren&#146;, or &#145;Warren&#146;. He died of apoplexy at Orchard Cottage, Enfield Highway, on 24 April 1856, and was described on his death certificate as &#145;historical engraver&#146;. Engravings by both Warrens are held in the prints and drawings department of the British Museum, London.<br>
