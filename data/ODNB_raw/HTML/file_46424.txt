<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Benett,  Etheldred</span>  (1775&#150;1845), <span class="occ">fossil collector and geologist</span>, was born on 22 July 1775 at Pyt House, Tisbury, Wiltshire, the eldest daughter of Thomas Benett (<i>c</i>.1729&#150;1797) and Catherine Darell (<i>d</i>. 1780). Her eldest surviving brother, John (1773&#150;1852), was a deputy lieutenant and magistrate for Wiltshire and a whig MP for Wiltshire from 1819 to 1852. His wife's half-brother, Aylmer Bourke Lambert (1761&#150;1842), an original fellow of the Linnean Society and well known as a botanist and geologist, encouraged Etheldred and her sister Anna Maria to study natural history. Etheldred took up the newly fashionable study of fossils, while her sister took up botany. Evidence of Etheldred's activity dates from July 1809, when William Cunnington (1754&#150;1810), naturalist and antiquary of Heytesbury, saw &#145;Miss Bennett's collection&#146;  (Cunnington MSS). Etheldred visited Cunnington in November the same year, and by 1810 she was in contact with James Sowerby (1757&#150;1822), artist and naturalist of London, then busy on his project to illustrate British fossils. From then on she acted as a clearing-house for palaeontological and geological investigations throughout Wiltshire, though these were sometimes interrupted by electioneering for her brother in the often sordid provincial politics before the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> of 1832.<br>
<br>Benett started corresponding with G. B. Greenough (1778&#150;1855), first president of the Geological Society, in 1813. In 1815 she sent the society a sketch of a measured section of the quarry at Chicksgrove, one of the first recorded in Britain. She had obtained the section from the quarry foreman. In 1816 she sent drawings of new fossil sponges from the Warminster Greensand. Sowerby soon reproduced her section (without permission) in <span class="italic">Mineral Conchology</span>. By 1817 she was in correspondence with Gideon Mantell, the discoverer of ancient fossil reptiles in Sussex. She was also soon in correspondence with William Buckland at Oxford University and, from 1829, with Samuel Woodward in Norwich.<br>
<br>Never having married, Benett was able, thanks to her financial independence, to gather high-quality specimens of fossils. She obtained these mostly through local collectors, from whom she purchased material from the many quarries then actively worked throughout Wiltshire. She also gathered fossil material on summer holidays to the Dorset coast. She distributed duplicate material to museums all over the country and further afield, making many donations to the Bristol Institution, the Geological Society of London, and the British Museum. Her fine personal collection became a first port of call for visiting geologists, who used it to study the strata exposed in her area, as did Charles Lyell in 1826. Inspired by this activity and by Mantell's publication of his <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Organic Remains of Sussex</span> (1829), in 1831 Benett published her similarly unillustrated &#145;Catalogue of the organic remains of Wiltshire&#146; in <span class="italic">Ancient Wiltshire</span> by her friend Sir Richard Colt Hoare. This work also contained her sister's list of local plants. The same year she reissued the fossil catalogue as a separate publication, adding newly prepared plates for illustration. &#145;This little work &hellip; of mere local interest&#146; she dedicated to Greenough. Her disclaimers reveal the difficulties she saw for any female geological author. These later gave some the false impression that her &#145;Catalogue&#146; of 1831 had not been properly published, when in fact it was widely distributed.<br>
<br>Benett's devotion to Wiltshire fossils, which had &#145;largely contributed&#146; to Sowerby's &#145;text book&#146;, was f&ecirc;ted by Murchison, the president of the Geological Society  (&#145;Address&#146;, 373). In her &#145;Catalogue&#146; she gave names to a number of valid new species and genera, and illustrated others, like Richard Owen's <span class="italic">Ichthyosaurus trigonus</span>, named later by experts she had consulted. She published another book in 1833, on the genealogy of her ancestor William Wake, archbishop of Canterbury, from whose family she had acquired her unusual Christian name. In 1836, when she was made a member of the Imperial Natural History Society of Moscow, she angrily discovered that her diploma was for &#145;Dominum [Master] Etheldredus Benett&#146;. The British Museum also had thanked &#145;Etheldred Benett Esq.&#146; for her book on fossils, though she had presented it in person to one of the librarians, &#145;telling him it was written by myself&#146;. Such episodes led her to believe that &#145;scientific people in general have a very low opinion of the abilities of my sex&#146;  (letter to Samuel Woodward, 12 April 1836, Castle Museum, Norwich).<br>
<br>On 11 January 1845 Benett died at her home, Norton House, Norton Bavant, Wiltshire. She was buried at Bavant parish church on 18 January. Her wonderful collection of fossils, her best memorial, was sold. The best portions are now in the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia; a smaller portion remains in Leeds City Museum. The greatest treasures in her collection were specimens of <i>Trigoniid</i> bivalves from the Portlandian of Tisbury. These showed that &#145;soft parts&#146; could be petrified. This first demonstration that muscle and gill parts could be preserved in fossils caused a sensation when announced by Edward Charlesworth in 1848. Extant specimens of her collection held in Philadelphia also reveal that Benett was one of the first to sieve for microfossils. Barred from the Geological Society by her sex, she was one of the earliest to demonstrate why such discrimination was short-sighted.<br>
