<span class="headword">Marsh,  Francis</span>  (1627&#150;1693), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin</span>, the son of Henry Marsh of Edgeworth, Gloucestershire, was born in or near Gloucester on 23 October 1627. He was admitted as a pensioner at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 22 April 1642, and graduated BA in 1647 and MA in 1650. On 14 October 1651 he was elected a fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and held the office of <i>praelector rhetoricus</i> for 1651&#150;2. Though learned in Greek and known for his studies in Stoic philosophy, his royalist sympathies stood in the way of his further preferment. In February 1653 he obtained four months' leave of absence to travel to Ireland, possibly in order to take orders from one of the Irish bishops then in Dublin (perhaps John Leslie, bishop of Raphoe). On returning to Caius College he was again <i>praelector rhetoricus</i> in 1654&#150;7, and remained in residence until April 1660.<br>
<br>Marsh's residence at Cambridge seemed assured by the king's letter of 8 October 1660, requesting the continuance of his fellowship, but he decided to return to Ireland on the advice of his patron, Jeremy Taylor. Shortly after the latter's accession to the sees of Down and Connor (January 1661), Marsh was appointed as dean of Connor (8 February 1661), having been ordained by Taylor on 27 January 1661. By 1 June 1661 he had, however, resigned this deanery, having, through the earl of Clarendon's influence, been moved to Armagh, where he was elected dean on 19 June 1661&#151;holding at the same time the rectorship of Clonfeacle. Three years later, again thanks to Clarendon, he was made archdeacon of Dromore. At the end of 1667 (elected 28 October, consecrated at Clonmel 22 December) he succeeded William Fuller as bishop of Limerick, Ardfert, and Aghadoe. He was translated on 10 January 1673 to Kilmore and Ardagh, and on 14 February 1682 was made archbishop of Dublin, holding <i>in commendam</i> the treasurership of St Patrick's and the prebend of Desertmore in St Fin Barre's, Cork.<br>
<br>It was in Marsh's palace that the privy council assembled on 12 February 1687, when Tyrconnell was sworn in as lord deputy. Early in 1689, feeling his position unsafe, owing to his opposition to the administration of Tyrconnell, Marsh returned to England, having attempted to appoint William King, then dean of St Patrick's, to act as his commissary. King declined the commission as not legally executed, and prevailed upon the chapters of Christ Church and St Patrick's to elect Anthony Dopping, then bishop of Meath, as administrator of the spiritualities. Marsh, who favoured the transfer of the crown to William of Orange, was included in the act of attainder passed by James's Dublin parliament in June 1689, his name being placed in the first list for forfeiture of life and estate. He returned to Dublin after the battle of the Boyne, but was not present at the thanksgiving service in St Patrick's on 6 July 1690, excusing his absence on the ground of age and infirmity, though in the same year he published his only work: <span class="italic">An Address Given into the Late King James, by the Titular Archbishop of Dublin</span> (1690). In his last years he repaired and enlarged the archiepiscopal palace of St Sepulchre's at his own cost. He died there of apoplexy on 16 November 1693, and was buried on 18 November in Christ Church, Dublin, Dopping preaching the funeral sermon. Marsh had married Mary, youngest daughter of Jeremy Taylor, and they had four children: Francis, Jeremiah, Barbara, and Mary, the second son succeeding him as treasurer of St Patrick's and afterwards becoming dean of Down. He was apparently not related to Narcissus Marsh, his successor in the see of Dublin. His will, dated 24 October 1693 and proved on 20 November 1693, left all his property to his wife and children.<br>
