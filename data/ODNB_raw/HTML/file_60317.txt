<span class="headword">Constanduros <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Tilling]</span>,  Mabel</span>  (1880&#150;1957), <span class="occ">comedienne and writer</span>, was born on 29 March 1880 at Devonshire House, Peckham Road, Camberwell, London, one of the seven children of Richard Stephen Tilling, managing director of the Thomas Tilling &amp; Son bus company, and his wife, Sophie Thorn. She was educated at various establishments, including the Mary Datchelor School in Camberwell and a boarding-school on the south coast, and then worked as her father's private secretary. She was married during the 1900s to Athanasius Constanduros, an insurance broker, who died in 1937. They had three children, of whom only a son, Michael, survived into adulthood. The marriage clearly failed long before 1937; Mabel's autobiography mentions her husband hardly at all and never favourably or by name. She moved in the late 1920s or early 1930s to the village of Bury in Sussex, where she took responsibility for bringing up her son. Her active membership of an amateur dramatic society from about 1910 to 1920 led to a period of training at the Central School of Speech Training. Here she discovered a facility for writing short stories and &#145;cockney sketches&#146;, and was encouraged to approach the BBC for employment. She joined the Radio Repertory Company in February 1925 and made her first broadcast on 23 March that year.<br>
<br>Mabel Constanduros is remembered above all for her creation of the Buggins family, the first radio family, which made its initial appearance on 1 September 1925 in the sketch &#145;The Buggins Family out for a Day&#146;, with regular broadcasts beginning in 1928. Between 1928 and 1948, when the family made its final broadcasts during BBC's <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span>, Constanduros wrote and performed in over 250 Buggins radio scripts. Initially she played all six speaking parts: Grandma Buggins, Mrs Buggins, her three children (Emma, Alfie, and Baby Buggins), and Aunt Maria. For some years the father of the Buggins household was an unspeaking presence, but in the early 1930s the part was created by Michael Hogan, with whom Mabel had written a number of radio plays and sketches. He was followed by John Rorke, who co-wrote many of the later scripts. Grandma, a crusty, cantankerous old biddy described by Constanduros as &#145;one of the tiresomest and cussedest creatures I could imagine&#146;  (Gifford, 37&#150;8), lay at the heart of the programme, which became extremely popular with audiences as a result of its skilful characterization and gentle humour combined with sheer appreciation of Constanduros's acting skills. The popularity of the family was such that the Ministry of Food used Mrs Buggins to broadcast recipes during the Second World War. Constanduros made a well-received variety d&eacute;but at the Coliseum in September 1929, and the family seemed destined for a highly successful live career, but their creator never enjoyed this work and abandoned it quite swiftly. She continued to act, however, appearing successfully as Mrs Bones in A. P. Herbert's operetta <span class="italic">Derby Day</span> in 1932 and undertaking a certain amount of film work. Her last live stage performance was at the Palace Theatre, Watford, in 1953. The Buggins family was not the only radio family she created: the English family Robinson, which she created with her nephew Denis Constanduros, first appeared in a radio play in 1939 and continued through 1940 as an occasional feature.<br>
<br>Given Mabel's remarkable success with the Buggins family, it is interesting that in her autobiography she claimed to &#145;think of myself first as a writer and secondly as a straight actress&#146;  (Constanduros, 64). She was certainly a prolific playwright, credited with having written over 100 plays by herself and many more in collaboration with others (notably Howard Agg and Denis Constanduros). Her most successful&#151;written with her nephew&#151;was <span class="italic">Acacia Avenue</span>, which ran for over 200 performances at the Vaudeville Theatre in 1943. Perhaps her family situation explains why, when reading the correspondence between Constanduros and the BBC, one is struck by the constant arguments about fees. Nevertheless she blended happily into local Sussex life, and Mrs Buggins made one of her last appearances when she opened Aldingbourne church f&ecirc;te in 1956. Constanduros died of a heart attack in the Royal West Sussex Hospital, Chichester, on 8 February 1957. Although today her reputation has faded, she was a popular cultural figure between the wars, helping to establish the style and flavour of British radio comedy.<br>
