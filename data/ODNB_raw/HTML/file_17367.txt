<span class="headword">Mac Bruaid&iacute;n <span class="st"> [Mac Bruaideadha]</span>,  Tadhg  mac D&aacute;ire</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1570, <em>d.</em> in or after 1625), <span class="occ">Gaelic poet and genealogist</span>, was from Knockanalban (Knockanalbanie or Cnoc an Albanaigh), barony of Ibrickan, in the parish of Kilmurry, co. Clare, one of a large family of sons and daughters of D&aacute;ire Mac Bruaideadha and Finola Gray of Knockanalban. Mentioned in the fiants of Elizabeth as resident at Knockanalban in 1586 and 1602  (<span class="italic">Fiants</span>, nos. 4860, 6615), Tadhg also appears as a witness (Teige Mac Brody) of a conveyancing agreement dated 1594  (Hardiman, 83). Information concerning him is supplied by his descendant Anthony Bruodinus OFM in a work published in Prague in 1669, and in a work published two years later under a pseudonym in which he responded to his detractor Thomas Carew. Of his brothers, Domhnall mac D&aacute;ire is also known as a poet and the compositions of both are sometimes confounded in the sources.<br>
<br>According to Bruodinus, Tadhg knew Greek, Latin, and English, and became tutor to Donnchadh &Oacute; Briain, the future earl of Thomond. The latter is said to have been fostered for the first seven years of his life in the house of Tadhg's sister Finola, and to have been attended by Tadhg during his education at the English court, where he went for two years at the age of twenty-one. The same is known to have been residing in the court of Elizabeth in 1577. Following Donnchadh &Oacute; Briain's succession as fourth earl of Thomond in 1580 Tadhg is said to have served as <i>aulae prefectus</i> in his household  (Bruodinus, <span class="italic">Propugnaculum</span>, 851) and to have acted as district sheriff. (Tadhg is not mentioned among the list of high sheriffs of co. Clare, however; see McGrath, 62). Tadhg married Anna Mohuny with whom he had six children, and his estate passed to his son Jacobus on his death. According to O'Flanagan (1808), Tadhg was assigned Dunogan Castle (barony of Ibrickan) by the earl of Thomond, but this cannot be verified  (McGrath, 62). Irish sources refer to him commonly as Tadhg mac D&aacute;ire, while his full name sometimes appears as Tadhg mac D&aacute;ire M(h)ic Bhruaideadha (Mhic Bhruaid&iacute;n) from which it is concluded that he did not become head of the surname (that is, &#145;Mac Bruaideadha&#146;) in his lifetime.<br>
<br>In all approximately thirty compositions attributed to Tadhg have survived. Among these are a number which can be dated approximately to the early 1580s. Ten members of the O'Briens of Thomond and the Burkes of Clanricarde are remembered in the elegy &#145;Anois d&iacute;olam an deachmhaidh&#146;, apparently written about 1580  (O'Grady, 390). The poet recalls other former Connaught patrons in &#145;A mhacaoimh sh&eacute;nas mo sheirc&#146;  (O Lochlainn), including a &#145;Mhaol M&oacute;rdha&#146;. He can be identified as M. Mac Suibhne of Sligo (<i>d</i>. 1581) for whom Tadhg composed jointly with Tadhg Dall &Oacute; hUiginn a <i>cros&aacute;ntacht</i> &#145;Tugam aghaidh ar Mhaol M&oacute;rdha&#146;. A further composition by him in that genre, &#145;Rannam le ch&eacute;ile a chlann Uilliam&#146;  (Mac Cionnaith, no. 111), was composed for two of the Burkes of Clanricarde some time before 1582  (Bruodinus, <span class="italic">Anatomicum Examen</span>, 116). The poem &#145;Teallach flaithis fine Caoimh&#146; which gives the martial roll of the ancestors of Art (son of Art) &Oacute; Caoimh was written before about 1583  (Walsh, 7).<br>
<br>Several compositions are addressed by Tadhg to Donnchadh &Oacute; Briain, among the earliest of which is the widely disseminated &#145;M&oacute;r at&aacute; ar theagasc flatha&#146;, a poem of advice which was composed possibly to mark the earl's succession in 1580  (O'Flanagan). Much copied also is the short didactic poem to the same patron &#145;Mo cheithre rann duit a Dhonnchaidh&#146;, but less so the short composition &#145;Aoidhe &oacute; Cais na chr&iacute;ch f&eacute;in&#146; which deals with the earl's martial exploits. Tadhg's elegy written on the occasion of the death of the earl in 1624, &#145;Easgar Gaoidheal &eacute;ag aoinfhir&#146;  (&Oacute; Cu&iacute;v), is transmitted in only one independent copy. The genealogical poem &#145;Mithid dul d'fhagh&aacute;il m'fhiach&#146; addresses another of the O'Briens, namely Donnchadh, son of Brian of Carraig &Oacute; gConaill. The short composition &#145;N&iacute; tr&aacute;th dod dhol a Dhiarmaid&#146; is a touching prayer for the recovery from illness of Diarmaid &Oacute; Briain, fifth baron of Inchiquin (<i>d</i>. 1624). In contrast, &#145;Tairgidh mo sheachna a sh&iacute;ol mBriain&#146; represents a sharply worded warning to certain of the O'Briens not to interfere with his property, lest they be made to feel the power of his satire. Similar in theme and tone is &#145;F&oacute;iridh mo leisge a Leath Chuinn&#146;, a threatening satire against a member of the Burkes who joined in stealing cattle from the poet during a foray into his district led by Red Hugh O'Donnell in 1599  (Mac Cionnaith, no. 95). Apart from the poems for Art &Oacute; Caoimh and Donnchadh &Oacute; Briain (Carraig &Oacute; gConaill), further evidence of Tadhg's activity as a professional genealogist is in a tract on Clann U&iacute; Dhuibhdhabhoireann ascribed to him to which is appended a poem on the same subject &#145;[N&iacute; crann] aontoraidh an uaisle&#146; (incomplete)  (Macnamara).<br>
<br>Tadhg is chiefly known, however, as the initiator and chief protagonist of the poetic contention known as &#145;Iomarbh&aacute;gh na bhfileadh&#146; dealing with the rival historical claims to supremacy in Ireland of the descendants of the mythical &Eacute;ibhear representing the northern half of Ireland, and those of &Eacute;ireamh&oacute;n representing the southern half. In all he contributed nine poems of varying length to the controversy, beginning with &#145;Olc do thagrais a Thorna&#146;, a criticism of claims in favour of the northern half by the ancient author Torna &Eacute;igeas. In a letter from Dublin dated June 1617 he issued an invitation to other protagonists to meet at Gort, co. Galway, in order to submit the dispute to arbitration by judges to be nominated by both sides. The letter with his own signature survives  (Breatnach, 97&#150;9).<br>
<br>A number of religious compositions are also ascribed to Tadhg's authorship including an address to the cross of Christ (&#145;A chroch D&eacute; d&eacute;ana mo leigheas&#146;) and a nativity poem (&#145;D&eacute;anadh go subhach s&iacute;ol &Aacute;dhaimh&#146;)  (Mac Cionnaith, nos. 2, 17).<br>
<br>A tradition recorded by nineteenth-century co. Clare sources tells that Tadhg was murdered in 1652 by a Cromwellian soldier who was granted his Dunogan lands, but no verification is available and the date given conflicts with the evidence of Bruodinus who understood his relation to have died about 1621  (McGrath, 62). The only contemporary evidence that Tadhg lived beyond that date is found in a list of names drawn up by Don Philip O'Sullivan Beare about the year 1625 in which &#145;Thaddaeus MacBruodinus&#146; is mentioned among a list of contemporary Irish lawyers and doctors and poets on the continent at the time of writing  (Gwynn, 11). It may be therefore that Tadhg left Ireland following the death of Thomond in 1624.<br>
