<span class="headword">Jones,  (Ronald) Maxwell <span class="st"> [Max]</span></span>  (1917&#150;1993), <span class="occ">jazz critic and author</span>, was born on 28 February 1917 at 9 Nightingale Road, Bushey, Hertfordshire, the youngest son and second of the three children of Theophilus Hill (Theo) Jones, an iron and scrap metal merchant, and his wife, Elsie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brierley. Both parents were English. He lived and was educated in the Primrose Hill area before attending Regent Street Polytechnic, London, where, with his brother Clifford Hill (Cliff) Jones (<i>b</i>. 1914) and friends, he formed an eight-piece amateur dance band. He played tenor and soprano saxophones and learned about jazz from American records, and, although the band never progressed further than amateur standard, it continued beyond his student days. He joined the band of trumpeter Johnny Claes but abandoned the tenor saxophone after hearing the instrument's master Coleman Hawkins at first hand, and, although persevering with lessons on alto saxophone, he eventually decided to abandon playing music. He heard Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Joe Venuti, and Cab Calloway on their British visits and, with Claes, got to know the small contingent of local black musicians, whose society he enjoyed. By the end of the 1930s he was involved with the rhythm club movement, giving record recitals and writing about jazz.<br>
<br>A lifelong social conscience, formed early on through Jones's interest in African American music, was cemented by witnessing police corruption at his father's business premises. In 1935 he joined the Communist Party. As a conscientious objector he spent most of the war years as an air raid warden in London, but he also travelled to High Wycombe, where his parents had moved, and, with Peter Duffell, started a rhythm club in the town. In 1943 he wrote about jazz for the Young Communist League weekly, <span class="italic">Challenge</span>, and formed the Challenge Rhythm Club, organizing record recitals and lectures under its auspices and concert appearances by Claes and the Trinidadian trumpeter Cyril Blake.<br>
<br>On 8 January 1942 Jones married Amy Alice (Sandra) Salberg (1920&#150;2002), the daughter of George Henry Salberg, glass worker and photographer's processor; they had one daughter, Vivienne Anne Lindsey Jones (<i>b</i>. 1944), who was later known as Vivienne Anne Lindsey Luck. He subsequently began a long relationship with his sister-in-law Betty Elizabeth Salberg (1925&#150;1992), who changed her name to Jones before their son, Nicholas Carl Maxwell Jones, was born in 1948; they married on 14 May 1965 after his previous marriage was dissolved.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1942 the publication <span class="italic">Jazz Music</span> was launched, with Jones and Albert J. McCarthy as editors. Established jazz writers were featured and Jones, in addition to his musical articles, reported on racial matters in the USA. &#145;A survey of slavery&#146;, written with Charles Wilford and published in <span class="italic">Jazz Music</span> in 1944, provided an educational jolt to enthusiasts for whom the blues existed only as music on a 78 r.p.m. shellac record. Although limited in size by wartime restrictions, the magazine published poetry and reprinted writings by the American jazz historian William Russell and Harlem renaissance figures Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. In April 1944 the editors formed the Jazz Sociological Society and, when <span class="italic">Jazz Music</span> temporarily ceased publication, they produced a series of erudite booklets on aspects of jazz, one of which included a report by Jones on the fight to desegregate the American armed forces. In 1945 Jones was one of several writers who formed the British Hot Record Society; he also co-edited <span class="italic">Piano Jazz</span> with McCarthy. A tribute to the folk-singer Leadbelly (1946) presaged the reappearance of <span class="italic">Jazz Music</span>, which included new articles by musicians as well as collectors; notable features included Jeff Aldam's &#145;African survivals in Afro-America&#146; (1947). He also edited Ernest Borneman's important book <span class="italic">A critic looks at jazz</span> (1946).<br>
<br>In 1944 Jones collaborated with Rex Harris in writing the column &#145;Collectors' corner&#146; for <span class="italic">Melody Maker</span>, then, in 1945, joined the staff of that newspaper. In the ensuing years he produced a substantial body of writing about jazz, blues, and gospel music, and the lives of these musical idioms' practitioners. At the heart of this corpus was a prolific collection of interviews, many of which, through their subsequent&#151;and uncredited&#151;extraction in Nat Hentoff and Nat Shapiro's <span class="italic">Hear me Talkin' to ya</span> (1955), provided important building blocks in the creation of the oral jazz history. With Jones as amanuensis, the stories of pianist Mary Lou Williams, clarinettist Edmond Hall, and others were serialized at a time when no other newspaper would have considered them worthy of such coverage; these recollections were later reprinted in <span class="italic">Talking Jazz</span> (1987).<br>
<br>Jones was always concerned by racial injustice, whether in the United States, Britain, or South Africa. Following the 1958 Notting Hill racial disturbances he became involved in the Stars' Campaign for Inter-racial Friendship (SCIF) and, while proposing reforms, wrote a spirited defence of the new black settler community, published in <span class="italic">Melody Maker</span> in 1959. Though always associated with jazz, his musical and other interests were wide: he wrote about the folk-singer Woody Guthrie when he was unknown outside the USA, and expressed enthusiasm for the young Bob Dylan. He also wrote sympathetically about many women musicians.<br>
<br>Although he was himself a spirited raconteur and bon viveur, Jones had the ability to empathize with his subjects and thus get the best from them. He wrote about both major and minor jazz figures with uncommon respect, while presenting them as equally human and fallible characters. This emphasis influenced several younger acolytes. The seamless conversational style he evolved, his horn-rimmed spectacles, and the trademark black beret he always wore were known throughout the jazz world.<br>
<br>A long-standing admirer of Louis Armstrong, Jones paid tribute to his hero by co-writing the trumpeter's biography with John Chilton; <span class="italic">Louis</span> was published in 1971. His genuine love for the music led to lasting friendships with many of the musicians he interviewed, most notably with Armstrong and the singer Billie Holiday, and the Jones household accommodated many top names from the world of jazz; trumpeter Buck Clayton tipped his hat to his host with his composition &#145;Mr Melody Maker&#146;. Motor-racing remained another passion: his long association with Claes and former drummer Les Leston encompassed shared racing-circuit activities. His other enduring interests were cricket and wine: he was vice-captain of both the Melody Maker and the Ravers cricket teams and an enthusiastic member of the Wig and Pen Club.<br>
<br>On retirement from <span class="italic">Melody Maker</span> in 1982 Jones became a freelance television consultant and continued to write, and turned his collection of photographs and memorabilia into a library which his son continued to maintain. He died of heart failure at St Richard's Hospital, Chichester, Sussex, on 2 August 1993. He was survived by his two children, his wife, Betty, having predeceased him.<br>
