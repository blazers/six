<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hewitt, Sir  Frederic William</span>  (1857&#150;1916), <span class="occ">anaesthetist</span>, was born on 2 July 1857 at 52 Westbourne Park Villas, London, the eldest of six children (there were three brothers and two sisters), of George Frederick Hewitt (1832&#150;1869), agricultural chemist, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1833), daughter of Thomas and Elizabeth Day of Stratton St Margaret, Wiltshire. Hewitt was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London, from 1869 to 1874. He then attended the Royal School of Mines for two years and shortly afterwards won a scholarship to Christ's College, Cambridge. After graduating BA with a third class in the natural science tripos he became in 1880 a medical student at St George's Hospital, London, where he won prizes in medicine and surgery. He qualified MRCS in 1882 and graduated MB (Cambridge) in 1883, and MD in 1886. He intended to practise in London as a physician and joined a colleague, Marmaduke Sheilds, in rooms in Somerset House, Portman Square. However, a defect in Hewitt's eyesight, which had begun to trouble him at Cambridge, became worse, and he decided to take up anaesthetics. He was appointed anaesthetist to Charing Cross Hospital, London, in 1884, to the National (later the Royal Dental) Hospital in 1885, and to the London Hospital in 1886.<br>
<br>Hewitt's first paper was published in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> in 1885; it was the first of many describing apparatus for the safe administration of nitrous oxide anaesthesia and demonstrated by detailed experiments the value of combining it with oxygen&#151;work which received the acclaim of the physiologist J. S. Haldane. Hewitt rapidly became known as an outstanding anaesthetist and teacher, writing many papers and delivering many lectures on improving apparatus and techniques in anaesthesia. Always concerned that students and doctors should receive proper instruction in the subject, he was foremost in persuading the General Medical Council that the study of anaesthetics should form part of the medical curriculum. Hewitt wrote three textbooks, of which the most important, <span class="italic">Anaesthetics and their Administration</span>, was published in 1893. It reached its fifth edition in 1922, six years after his death.<br>
<br>In 1902, when Edward VII became ill with an appendicular abscess two days before his projected coronation, Hewitt administered the anaesthetic for the necessary operation. Afterwards, the king appointed him MVO. From that time, his practice became so busy that he gave up his appointments at the Charing Cross and Royal Dental hospitals. In 1902 he was given the honorary position of consulting anaesthetist at the London Hospital and returned to his alma mater, St George's Hospital, as physician anaesthetist.<br>
<br>Hewitt was appointed anaesthetist to Edward VII and later to George V. In 1907 he was honoured with a knighthood for his services to medicine. Much of the later part of his life was devoted to efforts to ensure that only medically qualified persons should be permitted to administer anaesthetics, and he was largely responsible for organizing a bill to be presented to parliament which would legalize the position. Unfortunately, pressure of business and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 caused the bill to be dropped and it was never reconsidered.<br>
<br>A photograph of Hewitt, which remained in the Royal College of Physicians, shows a balding man with a rather triangular face and a moustache, and bearing a solemn appearance. Even family photographs never show him smiling, yet he had a lively sense of humour. He was a popular student at Cambridge and at St George's, where he wrote many humorous poems and sketches which appeared in the hospital's <span class="italic">Gazette</span> even after he had achieved fame.<br>
<br>On 24 December 1891 Hewitt married Emmie (Eve) Elizabeth (1868/9&#150;1950), daughter of George Clare. They had three children, two daughters and one son, who died in infancy. The Hewitts lived in London first at 10 George Street (later St George Street), Hanover Square; in 1901 they moved to 14 Queen Anne Street, where they lived for the next fourteen years. In 1902 Hewitt bought a house in Peppard, near Henley-on-Thames, which the family visited as often as possible. In 1915 the Hewitts' London residence became 24 Harcourt House, Cavendish Square.<br>
<br>Hewitt died of stomach cancer on 6 January 1916, at 146 King's Road, Brighton, a town to which the family frequently went on holiday; he was buried in the Brighton and Preston cemetery four days later. A memorial service was held at St George's Hospital Chapel on 12 January 1917. Lady Hewitt died on 2 April 1950 and was buried in the same grave as her husband.<br>
<br>Frederic Hewitt's work was a major factor in establishing anaesthesia as a subject requiring the full attention of specially trained medical men and women. He is commemorated by a lectureship at the Royal College of Surgeons, since 1991 held at the Royal College of Anaesthetists.<br>
