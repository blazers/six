<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boulestin,  (Xavier) Marcel</span>  (1878&#150;1943), <span class="occ">restaurateur and writer on cookery</span>, was born at Poitiers, France, where his mother, the daughter of a former lyc&eacute;e teacher, shared the house of his widowed maternal grandmother. Boulestin grew up and attended school in Poitiers, developing strong interests in music and the theatre. He visited his father, who maintained a largely separate existence, only for a month each summer, at the property that he owned at St Aulaye in the valley of the Dronne north-west of P&eacute;rigueux.<br>
<br>By the time that Boulestin was eighteen both his mother and his grandmother had died. From the latter he had a 1200 franc annuity, which allowed him to follow his aesthetic inclinations with no acute worries about adopting a serious career. Moving to Bordeaux, a city which impressed him with its elegance and sophistication, he settled down for several years, ostensibly to study law at the university there. In fact he became a full-time concert-goer and acquaintance of visiting musicians, contributing a regular &#145;Bordeaux letter&#146; to the national magazine <span class="italic">Courrier Musical</span>. Before leaving to perform his military service in 1899, he published his first, unsuccessful book, a dialogue, <span class="italic">Le pacte</span>, with a foreword by the humorous writer Willy (Henri Gauthier-Villars, husband of the novelist Colette).<br>
<br>After military service, Boulestin moved to Paris and took a job as secretary to Willy. Ambitious for literary fame, he met many French and English artists and writers, translated Max Beerbohm's <span class="italic">The Happy Hypocrite</span> (published in the <span class="italic">Mercure de France</span>, 1905), and enjoyed the smart, Anglophile social life of Paris and Dieppe. With his thickset physique and southern appearance he was frequently caricatured by artist friends, and he was clearly popular for his cheerfully sybaritic approach to life. By 1906, however, he recognized that success had eluded him. In search of a change, he settled that autumn in London, immersing himself in the music-halls and theatres, and the follies and ostentatious luxury of the idle rich. As secretary to a playwright, Cosmo Gordon Lennox, he dabbled in journalism and dramatic translations, and collaborated with a friend, Francis Toye, on a lightweight novel, <span class="italic">The Swing of the Pendulum</span> (1911).<br>
<br>Switching to a new interest, interior decorating, in 1911, Boulestin equipped his rented flat in Elizabeth Street, Mayfair, with avant-garde materials imported from Paris, Florence, Munich, Vienna, and Berlin, and solicited custom from society friends, who recommended him to others. In August 1914 he was on the point of extending the business by taking a house with the designer Paul Poiret and decorating it entirely in Poiret's own lavish style; instead, he spent the next four years as an interpreter with the British expeditionary force in France. His post-war London shop, D&eacute;corations Modernes, proved a failure, as did his <span class="italic">Keepsake</span> (1921), an anthology bringing together the work of modern artists and writers. For some time Boulestin scraped a living by handicrafts, teaching French, and other means.<br>
<br>Boulestin's first cookery book, <span class="italic">Simple French Cooking for English Homes</span> (1923), resulted from a casual conversation with a director of Heinemann, followed by a &pound;10 advance. The book was an immediate success, since it suited the new, often servantless, pared-down sophistication of post-war domestic arrangements. Boulestin's explanations of basic French ways with meat, game, poultry, fish, and vegetables, inspired inventions such as sardine butter as an hors d'&#339;uvre, and his revelations of how to cook aubergines or produce a piperade helped to widen the culinary ambitions of British people to whom French cooking had hitherto seemed unattainably exotic.<br>
<br>Although originally a fervent admirer of the solider, more traditional English dishes, Boulestin reconciled this interest with an appreciation of his own earlier gastronomic background. Between 1923 and 1937 he published a dozen recipe books. Some he wrote alone (<span class="italic">The Conduct of the Kitchen</span>, <span class="italic">A Second Helping</span>, and <span class="italic">What Shall We Have Today?</span>); one, in 1930, with Jason Hill (<span class="italic">Herbs, Salads and Seasonings</span>); and three others (<span class="italic">120 Ways of Cooking Eggs</span>, <span class="italic">127 Ways of Preparing Savouries and Hors d'&#339;uvres</span>, and <span class="italic">101 Ways of Cooking Potatoes</span>) with his close friend and long-term partner, A. H. (Robin) Adair, whom he first met in 1923, and with whom he briefly ran a catering business for dinner parties before opening his first London restaurant in 1925. Editions of his books were still appearing in the 1950s.<br>
<br>The Restaurant Fran&ccedil;ais, on the corner of Panton Street and Leicester Square, flourished for two years despite the absence of a full alcohol licence, and received much fashionable support. In 1927 this gave way to a more ambitious venture, the eponymous Boulestin's (formerly Sherry's) Restaurant in Covent Garden. With its silk velvet curtains designed by Raoul Dufy, and its panelled walls and ceiling by Marie Lauren&ccedil;in and Jean-Emile Laboureur, the restaurant was a striking example of modern Parisian d&eacute;cor, attracting artists and opera-goers alike. The authenticity of the cooking was ensured by Boulestin's choice of chef, Bigorre, who had previously cooked at the famous Restaurant Paillard in Paris.<br>
<br>Once established as an apologist for simple French food and cooking, Boulestin achieved his true role in English life during the inter-war years, and paved the way for successors such as the equally literary Elizabeth David (who quoted with relish his earthy description, in his 1936 autobiographical volume, of the country foods of his childhood summers at St Aulaye). From 1928 he held cookery courses, first on his own, then under the auspices of Fortnum and Mason's store in Piccadilly. In 1937 he gave the first cookery demonstration on British television. He wrote regular columns for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, <span class="italic">Country Life</span>, <span class="italic">Harper's Bazaar</span>, and later the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>. His light-heartedly self-publicizing bent found expression in an autobiography in English, <span class="italic">Myself, my Two Countries</span> (1936); a gastronomic account of a French tour, <span class="italic">Having Crossed the Channel</span> (1934); and a volume of reminiscences in French, <span class="italic">A Londres nagu&egrave;re</span>, translated as <span class="italic">Ease and Endurance</span> (1948) by Adair.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1939 Boulestin and Adair were on holiday at Boulestin's house in the Landes. They remained in France, hoping to be able to contribute directly to the war effort. Adair was eventually interned as an enemy alien, and Boulestin moved to Paris in order to be near him. Boulestin was found dead on the morning of 20 September 1943 after a short illness, aged sixty-five.<br>
