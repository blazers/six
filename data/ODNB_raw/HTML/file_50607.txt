<span class="headword">Griffin,  John Joseph</span>  (1802&#150;1877), <span class="occ">chemist, author, and business manager</span>, the fourth and youngest son of Joseph Griffin (1752&#150;1838), was born at Webb Square in Shoreditch, London, on 22 January 1802. The family later moved to Glasgow where the father sold books and chemicals. The eldest son, Richard Thomas Griffin (1790&#150;1832), trained in the book trade under Thomas Tegg at Cheapside, London, for a five-year term, on 30 March 1820 joining him in equal partnership. From this time the business in Glasgow was styled Richard Griffin &amp; Co., while the London business traded under Tegg &amp; Co. By contrast, John Griffin received a chemical education under Andrew Ure at Anderson's Institution. His connection with the Glasgow Mechanics' Institution brought him under the influence of Thomas Clark who taught chemistry there. For some time in the 1820s he was employed on the staff of the <span class="italic">Scots Times</span>.<br>
<br>Griffin's enthusiasm for chemistry and his desire to help those students seeking an education in the subject was displayed in his various texts. Initially <span class="italic">Chemical Recreations</span> was written to assist those attending the newly formed Glasgow Mechanics' Institution in their home-based practical studies. It ran into six editions between 1823 and 1826. Towards the same cause he added <span class="italic">A Practical Treatise on the Use of the Blowpipe in Chemical and Mineral Analysis</span> in 1827. In 1829&#150;30 he visited Paris and Heidelberg where he noted various works of potential value for consideration at home. Of these, he translated F. P. Danger's <span class="italic">L'art du souffleur &agrave; la lampe</span> and H. Rose's <span class="italic">Handbuch der analytischen Chemie</span> to launch, in 1831, a <span class="roman">Polytechnic Library</span> series through a joint arrangement between Richard Griffin &amp; Co. and the London-based publishing house of John Bumpus.<br>
<br>In 1832 Griffin married Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Holder (<i>b</i>. 1802); they had twelve children. Also in that year, just before Richard's death, John became a co-partner to the family business. He then, effectively, ran the business alone until <a name="cosubject_50606"></a><span class="headword">Charles Griffin</span>  (1819&#150;1862)<span class="occ"></span>, his deceased brother's son, completed his education at the Anderson's University. When Charles joined the business about 1842 the earlier arrangement with Tegg was terminated. In time, Charles became a freeman of the City of Glasgow and, by 1850, was president of the Stationers' Company of Glasgow. Meanwhile, John Griffin developed the business of trade in chemical apparatus and, by 1848, had transferred these interests to London. By 1852 he had relinquished his part in Richard Griffin &amp; Co. in favour of his nephew. From the early 1860s the publishing side traded separately, first under the style Griffin, Bohn &amp; Co. to 1862, and then as Charles Griffin &amp; Co.<br>
<br>Under John Griffin's direction the publishing side of the family business developed a scientific leaning, as shown by the <span class="roman">Scientific Miscellany</span> series which appeared in the early 1840s and included <span class="italic">A System of Crystallography</span> (1841) which Griffin wrote principally to demystify and promote an otherwise inaccessible mathematical subject. Another venture included a prestige contract to republish, in a much extended form, the original (1816&#150;45) Smedley, Rose, and Rose <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia metropolitana</span>. This appeared during 1848&#150;9 in thirty volumes. Later involvement with other publishing houses came through the Cavendish Society, a group set up to perpetuate the name of the German chemist Leopold Gmelin (under whom Griffin had studied during his brief stay at Heidelberg) through the translation of the multivolume <span class="italic">Handbuch der Chemie</span>.<br>
<br>In parallel with these activities, John Griffin embarked on a project to supply apparatus to accompany the various texts. A trade catalogue dated November 1837 formally marks the start of this business, although a cartoon of the &#145;Billsticker&#146; in the company's <span class="italic">Book of Trades</span> (4th edn, 1837) suggests that he had already opened a chemical bazaar at the new premises in Buchanan Street to sell the portable chemical laboratories, prepared by Robert Best Ede of Dorking, to accompany the seventh edition of <span class="italic">Chemical Recreations</span> (1834). The eighth edition (1838), however, explains that he had set up a &#145;chemico-commercial&#146; project to see just how low prices for apparatus could be brought to develop a market need for cheap, robust, and reliable apparatus. With this new line established and developing he set out, in 1841, to Germany, Austria, and Bohemia, expressly to make contacts and to trade with suppliers in glass instruments and porcelain ware. By 1844 his catalogues showed apparatus sets for J. F. W. Johnston's <span class="italic">Catechism of Agricultural Chemistry and Geology</span> (1844), a pioneering text in elementary school science, as well as for the <span class="roman">Scientific Miscellany</span> series.<br>
<br>Griffin's social and intellectual life in Glasgow is recorded through his attendance at the Glasgow Philosophical Society, which he joined in April 1834. There he mixed with other influential persons from Anderson's and Glasgow universities, including, respectively, the chemists Thomas Graham and Thomas Thomson. Later, through the 1840s, he held the position of librarian to the society, and it was through the medium of the society that he announced his views on the &#145;proximate constitution of chemical compounds&#146;. These views were elaborated in a special &#145;Romance&#146; contained in the seventh edition of <span class="italic">Chemical Recreations</span> (1834) wherein, after describing the chaos of chemical nomenclature which then pervaded the literature, he denounced the views of the celebrated Jacob Berzelius before offering his own notions in substitution.<br>
<br>The inconvenience of Glasgow as a centre for the distribution of apparatus and the development of professional chemistry in London through the Chemical Society, of which Griffin was a founder member, were among factors which eventually led to the business being transferred to London. (Likewise, his nephew moved the publishing side to London, although not until the late 1850s.) In 1848 he opened a chemical museum in Marylebone under his own name, where he traded in chemicals and chemical apparatus as well as books for Richard Griffin &amp; Co. An expansion took place in 1850 when he added philosophical apparatus to his range following the take-over of a long-established London wholesaler, John Ward. Two further editions of <span class="italic">Chemical Recreations</span> (1849 and 1854/1860) ensured a dominant market share in the rising educational trade.<br>
<br>Although plagued by health problems, Griffin published <span class="italic">The Radical Theory in Chemistry</span> (1858), an interesting work on nomenclature applied to organic chemistry, yet unanalysed, in which there are echoes of his earlier views on chemical notation. The final works to appear under his name, <span class="italic">Chemical Testing of Wines and Spirits</span> (1866) and <span class="italic">Centigrade Testing Applied to the Arts</span> (1872), may have been written with the assistance of his sons, Charles Griffin FSA (1838&#150;1900) and <a name="cosubject_50607"></a><span class="headword">William Griffin</span>  (1839&#150;1883)<span class="occ"></span> who, from the early 1870s, had conducted the business under the style J. J. Griffin &amp; Sons. John Griffin died on 9 June 1877 at his home, 31 Park Road, Haverstock Hill, London.<br>
<br>By 1889, under the direction of William's son <a name="cosubject_47591"></a><span class="headword">John Ross Griffin</span>  (1863&#150;1921)<span class="occ"></span>, the business was incorporated as a limited liability company. Family connections remained with the business until John Ross's death, although some shareholding had passed into the family of Thomas McKinnon Wood MP, a close relative of the Griffin family, who, from about 1908, was director and later chairman; from about 1919 to 1957 the business was in the hands of his three sons. Under the direction of this family various mergers took place: first with the Scottish firm of Baird and Tatlock Ltd in 1925 to become (in 1928) Griffin and Tatlock Ltd, and then with W. and J. George and Becker Ltd in 1954 to become Griffin and George Ltd. From 1957 Griffin and George Ltd, together with T. Gerrard &amp; Co., formed the Education Group of Fisons Scientific Equipment Division.<br>
<br>Throughout his life John Griffin was passionately concerned with the promotion of chemistry. With equal vigour, he felt it his duty to clarify the language of chemistry which then suffered from a clutter of systems in mineralogy, chemical nomenclature, and crystallography. His texts demonstrate a high quality of thought, prescriptive action, and fearless criticism of established ideas. Even if his own ideas remained mostly untouched by the academic establishment, he was, nevertheless, largely responsible for creating the means of study to a growing mass audience through ingenious and cheap forms of chemical apparatus. He received many accolades in later life, including two prize medals from the Great Exhibition of 1851 and the International Exhibition of 1862, respectively for his graduated glass instruments and research apparatus. Equally, he should be remembered for his contributions to the subject itself, including, for example, the concept of normality as well as many laboratory techniques. In addition to his texts and trade catalogues, he published papers in the <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the Glasgow Philosophical Society and <span class="italic">Chemical News</span>; he can also be traced in the <span class="italic">Reports</span> of the British Association, of which he was a member.<br>
