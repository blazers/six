<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Constable,  John</span>  (1776&#150;1837), <span class="occ">landscape painter and draughtsman</span>, was born on 11 June 1776 at East Bergholt House, Church Street, East Bergholt, Suffolk, the fourth of six children of Golding Constable (1739&#150;1816), merchant, mill owner, and gentleman farmer, and Ann (1748&#150;1815), daughter of William Watts (<i>c</i>.1717&#150;1773), cooper, and Jane Brickbeck (<i>d</i>. 1771) of London. Golding was the sixth of ten children of John Constable (1705&#150;1777), farmer and landowner in Bures St Mary, Suffolk, and Judith Garrad; in 1764 he inherited from a paternal uncle money, stocks, and substantial property including the copyhold of a watermill in Flatford on the River Stour where it divides the counties of Suffolk and Essex. His marriage in 1767, followed by the birth of three children, necessitated a move in 1774 from the house at Flatford mill to nearby East Bergholt, where he built an imposing residence with stables and coachhouse. It was here that John Constable was born two years later. The house and its grounds, indeed the entire village and surrounding landscape with views of the Stour valley in all directions, formed a principal feature of his art throughout his life. As he explained to a friend in 1821, &#145;I associate my &#147;careless boyhood&#148; to all that lies on the banks of the <i>Stour</i>. They made me a painter &hellip; I had often thought of pictures of them before I had ever touched a pencil&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 6.78). Constable's highly original approach to landscape painting, fuelled by his desire to elevate the genre and shaped by his emotional and economic attachment to that part of East Anglia already known before his death as &#145;Constable's country&#146;, has ensured that his contribution to the development of landscape art in nineteenth-century Britain is rivalled only by that of his contemporary J. M. W. Turner.<h2>
<a name="TheSuffolkyears17761799"></a>The Suffolk years, 1776&#150;1799</h2>A frail infant hastily baptized on the night of his birth by the Revd W. W. Driffield, Constable nevertheless enjoyed a hearty childhood and <i>c</i>.1783 was sent to boarding-school in Fordstreet, Essex, and then to Lavenham, Suffolk. Mistreated there by a brutal usher, Constable returned home and continued his education as a day boy at nearby Dedham grammar school whose headmaster, the Revd Thomas Grimwood, treated him with kindness and indulged his early interest in painting. Captivated by the possibility of becoming an artist and reputedly disinclined to scholarly pursuit, Constable resisted family pressure to prepare for a career in the church. When it became apparent, however, that the disabilities of his elder brother Golding would prevent his taking over from their father, Constable reluctantly began training in the family business at the age of sixteen. Although he would ultimately have had a managerial role in the diverse and substantial corn and coal trade established by Golding senior, Constable was exposed to the practical side of the milling business as well, working in his father's windmill on East Bergholt Heath, gauging the evanescent meteorological conditions, and familiarizing himself with the navigable River Stour, with its watermills, locks, barges, towpaths, and adjacent fields, all of which were crucial to the family's prosperity. The knowledge he gained in these years, coupled with what he later characterized as &#145;his over-weaning affection for these scenes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Discourses</span>, 13), would subsequently inform the impassioned naturalism of his landscape art even when the scenery depicted was not East Anglian.<br>
<br>While thus employed, Constable continued to paint and draw, not professionally, but as a gentlemanly pursuit. Practical advice concerning materials and technique was provided by an amateur landscape painter, the local plumber and glazier John Dunthorne, who was Constable's frequent painting companion. Access to tuition of a different sort, as well as entr&eacute;e into the higher echelons of the art world, were fortuitously managed by Constable's mother in 1795 when she arranged an introduction to Sir George Beaumont, then visiting his own mother in Dedham. A distinguished painter and patron, Beaumont encouraged the young artist, commending his copies of engravings after Raphael and perhaps giving him practical advice about drawing techniques. More relevant to Constable's future career, however, was the opportunity to examine closely Claude's <span class="italic">Hagar and the Angel</span> (1646; National Gallery), a small landscape owned and highly valued by Beaumont. Constable would later look back on his first sight of this painting &#145;as an important epoch in his life&#146;  (Leslie, 1845, 6), triggering as it did a lifelong devotion to an artist thought to have painted directly from nature. Constable's youthful infatuation with painting was strengthened most significantly in 1796 when, engaged on family business outside London, he was introduced to two professional artists, John Cranch and J. T. (Antiquity) Smith, whose practical instruction improved his drawing skills and enriched his knowledge of the theoretical foundations of academic art; with their guidance he began to assemble what would become in the next forty years an impressive library and print collection  (<span class="italic">Further Documents and Correspondence</span>, 25&#150;52).<br>
<br>With an unwavering enthusiasm for art, Constable nevertheless dejectedly informed Smith in 1797 that he must &#145;attend to my Father's business &hellip; I certainly see it will be my lot to walk through life in a path contrary to that which my inclination would lead me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 2.10). In 1799, however, freed from family obligation when his younger brother Abram, now aged sixteen, was able to take his place, Constable left home with a sufficient allowance and parental consent to study art in London.<h2>
<a name="EarlyyearsinLondon17991809"></a>Early years in London, 1799&#150;1809</h2>In February 1799, armed with a letter of introduction from the author and philanthropist Priscilla Wakefield, Constable presented himself to Joseph Farington, an influential Royal Academician whose friendly intervention facilitated his entry into the London art world. In March he was admitted to the Royal Academy Schools as a probationer, restricted to drawing in the antique academy until February 1800 when he was enrolled as a student in the life academy. Constable's transition from life in East Bergholt to London was eased by the presence in the city of several family members, including his elder sister Martha Whalley and his maternal uncle David Pike Watts, a wealthy connoisseur and collector who took an active interest in his nephew's career. Constable's &#145;kind monitor&#146; Dr John Fisher, the rector of Langham and canon of Windsor when they first met in 1798, proved an influential friend in London, particularly after he became bishop of Salisbury and chaplain to the Royal Academy in 1807. While fellow students increased Constable's circle of friends, he continued to cultivate his connections with mentors such as Beaumont and Farington who gave him not only practical advice, but access to old master paintings, drawings, and prints which he was permitted to copy. Such copying, as Constable reported in a letter to Dunthorne in 1800, enabled him to &#145;acquire execution. The more facility of practice I get, the more pleasure I shall find in my art; without the power of execution I should be continually embarrassed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 2.24). Although his life was now essentially London-based, Constable returned to Suffolk frequently, maintaining close contact with family and friends there, but more importantly indulging his need to paint and draw from nature. Evidence that he was already beginning to formulate his personal vision of landscape art appears in a letter of May 1802 to Dunthorne:<blockquote>For these two years past I have been running after pictures and seeking the truth at second hand &hellip; I shall shortly return to Bergholt where I shall make some laborious studies from nature&#151;and I shall endeavour to get a pure and unaffected representation of the scenes that may employ me &hellip; There is room enough for a natural painture. (ibid., 2.32)</blockquote>Several small oil sketches painted during his lengthy visit to Bergholt that year, including <span class="italic">Dedham Vale</span> and <span class="italic">Dedham Vale: Evening</span> (V&amp;A), mark what is widely recognized as the starting point of a commitment to outdoor study that was to be the foundation of his art. This commitment, however, would always be tempered by his understanding of the theoretical precepts of Sir Joshua Reynolds and by his continued willingness to incorporate what he could learn from past artists, particularly Claude, Rembrandt, Rubens, Ruisdael, Wilson, and Gainsborough.<br>
<br>Stimulated by parental pressure to achieve some degree of financial independence, Constable found it necessary to resort to portraiture, finding many of his sitters through family and friends. East Anglian connections also led to a few commissions for altarpieces, but <span class="italic">Christ Blessing the Elements</span> (1810; St James's Church, Nayland), a rather saccharine, passionless painting, suggests that religious art did not engage Constable's creative capabilities; and an unwelcome offer of employment as a drawing instructor at a military school in 1802 was wisely turned down. As he confided to Dunthorne, &#145;it would have been a death blow to all my prospects of perfection in the Art I love&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 2.31). Although he continued to attend the life academy as a student until at least 1808&#151;producing competent, sensitively drawn nude studies&#151;he showed no inclination to pursue large-scale figural painting, thereby forfeiting what his parents would have seen as a more lucrative and prestigious career. The training he received in anatomy lectures and life classes, however, no doubt improved his understanding of the human form and augmented the early advice about figure placement which he attributed to J. T. Smith and frequently repeated in later life:<blockquote>Do not set about inventing figures for a landscape taken from nature; for you cannot remain an hour in any spot, however solitary, without the appearance of some living thing that will in all probability accord better with the scene and time of day than will any invention of your own. (Leslie, 1845, 7)</blockquote>Constable's parents were justified in their concern for his future. By 1809 they were still supplementing his meagre income and worried about his continued devotion to landscape painting. Even the three tours he made to expand his repertoire of picturesque scenery&#151;the Peak District in 1801, a month-long voyage down the Thames and along the Kentish coast in 1803, and the Lake District in 1806&#151;had been subsidized by family or friends. After ten years in London, however bleak his prospects may have looked and however small his impact in the public arena, he was none the less making progress: he had exhibited works at the Royal Academy and British Institution; he was beginning to explore promising techniques in watercolour and oil sketching that would lead to significant developments; and he was producing a remarkable number of drawings (two to three hundred in 1806 alone) that tested his compositional skills and kindled a lifelong experimental approach to graphic techniques and media. Bold enough to consider putting his name forward as an associate of the academy in 1807 (though he decided against it), he remained convinced that a career was possible. His perseverance intensified in 1809 when a friendship of several years blossomed into serious courtship and, realizing that marriage was impossible without financial security and professional recognition, he renewed his efforts with fervour.<h2>
<a name="Earlycourtshipandcareer18091811"></a>Early courtship and career, 1809&#150;1811</h2>Constable probably first encountered Maria Elizabeth Bicknell (1788&#150;1828) when, as a twelve-year-old child, she came to visit her maternal grandfather, Durand Rhudde, the wealthy rector of East Bergholt, chaplain-in-ordinary to George III, and one of the most influential residents of the village. She was the eldest of five children of Charles Bicknell, solicitor to the Admiralty and the prince regent, and his second wife, Maria Elizabeth Rhudde. Miss Bicknell may have aroused Constable's interest in 1806 during a visit to Bergholt when she was eighteen and he thirty. It was not until she came of age in 1809, however, that they declared their mutual affection, only to be met with family resistance led by the implacable Dr Rhudde, but dutifully implemented by her parents. Why Rhudde objected remains a mystery, but his threat to disinherit not only his granddaughter but all her siblings suggests a dislike of Constable that stemmed from something more personal than the struggling artist's precarious financial situation or his family's connections to trade. Some past offence, real or imagined (and possibly committed by Constable's father rather than himself), may have triggered Rhudde's absolute refusal to sanction the alliance; but whatever the cause, his relentless intervention plagued the couple's seven-year courtship which was marked by clandestine meetings and secret correspondence. The letters they exchanged throughout these years, as they move from polite decorum to heartfelt devotion, are a poignant chronicle of their relationship, but they also provide the emotional background for Constable's vigorous and anxious campaign to prove himself.<br>
<br>Constable's mother, astute about the vagaries of village life, interceded with maternal shrewdness when she could. She intercepted gossip from the rectory and encouraged her son to present Rhudde with a watercolour drawing of his church, complete with respectful inscription (1811; Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight). Her letters, displaying what has been perceptively characterized as &#145;a consistent mercantile protestantism&#146;  (Rosenthal, 10), urged him to pursue his goals with Christian fortitude, patience, and diligence since only by these would he reap the benefits of his industry and earn the money without which he could never contemplate marriage. Bolstered by her support, and by a conviction that he was destined to inaugurate a genre of landscape that was not only original but &#145;moral&#146;, he redoubled his efforts to make his mark and his living.<br>
<br>Constable had painted few outdoor oil sketches since his intensive period of activity in 1802; and those, such as <span class="italic">The Rectory, East Bergholt</span> (1808; FM Cam.) or <span class="italic">View at Epsom</span> (1809; Tate collection) are, though marked by a fresh spontaneity, subdued both in handling and colour. From 1810, however, a greater boldness in his palette and urgency in his brushwork appear. Two dated sketches from that year, <span class="italic">The Rectory from East Bergholt House</span> and <span class="italic">View on the Stour</span> (Philadelphia Museum of Art), and several undated ones of Dedham Vale looking west from the Suffolk side of the Stour reveal a renewed desire to capture the varied look of the natural landscape in a form that, in conjunction with numerous drawings, might be used in his London studio to construct paintings for exhibition. This working method produced the panoramic <span class="italic">Dedham Vale: Morning</span> (priv. coll.), shown at the academy in 1811. Arcadian in mood, but utterly faithful to the local topography, its originality confirms the progress Constable had made since his first academy exhibit of 1802, <span class="italic">The Edge of a Wood</span> (Art Gallery of Ontario), with its heavy reliance on Gainsborough. Having sought election as an associate for the first time in 1810 without receiving a single vote, Constable was especially keen that <span class="italic">Dedham Vale: Morning</span>, the most ambitious painting he had yet produced, should prove his worth both to the academicians and to Maria's family. He later told his engraver David Lucas that no painting had ever caused him more anxiety and that &#145;he had even said his prayers before it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Further Documents and Correspondence</span>, 55).<h2>
<a name="Courtshipandcareer18111816"></a>Courtship and career, 1811&#150;1816</h2>For the next five years Constable continued to divide his time between London and Bergholt painting portraits for money but, for fame, devoting himself to the landscape. Despite worrying weight loss and depression, he filled his sketchbooks with hundreds of drawings and further explored the possibilities of outdoor sketching in oil. Working on canvas, board, and specially prepared papers, he experimented with even more innovative handling, making rapid and vibrant notations of the scenery and the changing weather. By painting the same sites from many different viewpoints, he tested the compositional variations that he hoped would, when amalgamated in his studio, contribute to the natural effect and verisimilitude of his finished works. By 1816 his studio&#151;and his memory&#151;would be stocked with images of Dedham Vale from both sides of the Stour. Although there was special emphasis on Flatford mill and lock, Willy Lott's house (later to be immortalized in &#145;The Hay Wain&#146;, 1821; National Gallery), and views of and from East Bergholt, he had amassed an almost encyclopaedic visual record of whatever caught his eye: animals and humans as they moved down lanes, through fields, or along the river; domestic buildings and churches as they nestled in the valley or rose on the horizon; and, of course, the sky.<br>
<br>In 1812 Constable exhibited <span class="italic">A Water-Mill</span> (priv. coll.) at the Royal Academy, a work whose genesis can be traced, like so many of his paintings, from a salmagundi of drawings, sketches, and studies. It features Flatford mill and lock, a site arguably associated in his mind at this time with Maria and one that had so fully absorbed him since 1810 that the mill &#145;had become as much Constable's business as his father's&#146;  (Bermingham, 105). Local scenery continued to provide the subject matter for his exhibited works during these years, but he was still unsettled about the process by which he could achieve the desired effect. As he told his uncle in 1814, in response to one of Watts's kindly but critical letters, &#145;I know I have great deficiencies and that I have not yet, in a single instance, realised my ideas of art&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 4.38). At least one of his works exhibited in 1815, <span class="italic">Boat-Building</span> (V&amp;A), and perhaps a second, <span class="italic">View of Dedham</span> (Boston Museum of Fine Arts), were painted entirely in the open air during his visits to Bergholt the previous year, the former occupying his afternoons, the latter his mornings. Yet despite these various efforts to find an original manner of painting his native scenery&#151;that &#145;natural painture&#146; he had been pursuing since 1802&#151;Constable was still struggling to gain a foothold. Encouraged by the voiced support of some academicians, he had put his name forward for an associateship several more times, but the votes were not forthcoming. Farington, who continued to offer advice as though Constable were still a student, suggested that he study Claude more closely to overcome the sketchy, unfinished handling that was seen by the academy to be his greatest fault. Those few reviewers in the popular press who were beginning to notice Constable with some regularity now, particularly Robert Hunt in <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, also expressed reservations about his supposedly careless execution, but they were none the less struck by qualities they characterized as &#145;natural&#146;, &#145;fresh&#146;, and &#145;truthful&#146;. Indeed, the first known review of Constable had in 1807 singled out with apparent prescience several salient features that would engage both his supporters and detractors throughout his life: his boldness, his colouring, and his &#145;attention to Nature&#146;  (<span class="italic">St. James's Chronicle</span>, 7&#150;9 May).<br>
<br>Constable's ties to East Bergholt, though still strong in 1816, were about to change radically. The sudden death of his mother in 1815 and the death of his father after months of ill health the following year were emotionally traumatic for him, but his share of the inheritance eased his financial worries and removed at least one of the barriers to his marriage. The frustrations of a seven-year courtship had taken their toll on his art but not lessened his feelings for Maria. When further difficulties with Dr Rhudde erupted in 1816, Constable persuaded her that they had waited long enough. Aged forty, he was about to achieve a private happiness without which, as his friends and family all suspected, he would never advance professionally: &#145;all my hopes and prospects in life&#146;, he had written to her in 1814, &#145;are included in my attachment to you&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 2.119).<h2>
<a name="Marriagefamilyandtheacademy18161819"></a>Marriage, family, and the academy, 1816&#150;1819</h2>On 2 October 1816 Constable and Maria were married at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, by Bishop Fisher's nephew, John Fisher (1788&#150;1832), who since their first meeting in Salisbury in 1811 had become the artist's closest friend. Fisher, himself only recently married, invited the Constables to his vicarage in Osmington, Dorset, where they spent six weeks of their honeymoon, returning to London in December. Constable, who had lived in bachelor's lodgings in at least six different locations in London since 1799, brought Maria to his rooms at 63 Charlotte Street where he had been living for five years. Within six months they moved to 1 Keppel Street, Bloomsbury, by which time she had already suffered a miscarriage and was pregnant again. A son, the first of seven children, was born in December 1817; his arrival may have softened the heart of Dr Rhudde, who ultimately bequeathed to Maria the same portion as her siblings when he died in 1819. The child, as Constable's first biographer, the artist C. R. Leslie, recalled, was seen almost as often in his father's arms as in his mother's: &#145;His fondness for children exceeded, indeed, that of any man I ever knew&#146;  (Leslie, 1845, 77).<br>
<br>To supplement the interest he was receiving from his father's bequest, plus his annual share of the family business and Maria's small annuity from her father, Constable calculated that he would need to earn an additional &pound;100&#150;150 per year to cover their expenses. He still relied heavily for his income on portraiture (<span class="italic">Mrs Jane Andrew</span>, 1818; Tate collection; <span class="italic">Mrs James Pulham, Sr</span>, 1818; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and on occasional paintings of specific sites, such as <span class="italic">Wivenhoe Park, Essex</span>, commissioned by General Slater-Rebow in 1816 (National Gallery of Art, Washington). Only a few of his landscapes shown at the Royal Academy or British Institution since 1802 had found buyers, and those for the most part had been purchased by family or acquaintances. In 1818, however, he sold two paintings at the British Institution and a third there the following year. The report of these sales in the press served as useful advertising, alerting other buyers in the market place to his potential, but that service was also being performed by the reviewers who had begun to notice him with increasing frequency and with greater appreciation for the vivacity and spirit of his landscapes.<br>
<br>Maria, pregnant again by late 1818, gave birth to a daughter the following summer. His wife's health, delicate even before their marriage, was to be a constant source of concern to Constable; and in August 1819 he rented a cottage in Hampstead where Maria and the children would be spared the bad air of London for at least a few months. This retreat to a suburban (indeed, almost rural) setting would become an annual event, not only benefiting Maria's lungs but introducing Constable to a landscape that delighted him, engaging both his affections and his artistic creativity. As subject matter, Hampstead would never dislodge the pre-eminence of the Stour valley; with its glorious skies, however, it now began to attract his attention as Salisbury had done since his first visit there in 1811.<br>
<br>Although settled and calm in his private life at last, Constable still faced professional frustration. He had failed yet again to become an associate member of the academy in the elections of 1817 and 1818; but with the same tenacity that had brought him to London in 1799 and sustained him in his difficult courtship, he renewed his efforts to discover an original, innovative style that would gain academic approval, public recognition, and patronage. He exhibited only one painting at the academy in 1819, <span class="italic">A Scene on the River Stour</span> (&#145;The White Horse&#146;, Frick Collection, New York), but it achieved much that had so far eluded him. Measuring 6 feet by 4 (the first of what came to be known as his &#145;six-footers&#146;), it was the largest canvas he had submitted and represents an unprecedented development in his working method. Constable had by this time spent almost two decades experimenting with various procedures by which direct work from nature could be transformed into paintings deemed suitable for exhibition. To paint anything so large as &#145;The White Horse&#146;, a Stour Canal scene, direct from the motif was certainly impractical; the lengthy stays in East Anglia where such outdoor work could be done were now precluded by the sale of the parental home in East Bergholt and by his reluctance to be separated so long from his family in London. His solution was to comb through his extensive store of drawings and oil sketches as before, but to use them in conjunction with an intermediary, full-scale (that is, 6 foot) oil sketch on which he could test the effects of composition as well as of the chiaroscuro, that crucial balance of light and shadow so important to his perception of &#145;natural&#146; landscape painting. Although much is still unknown about his precise working methods, Constable's experimentation unleashed a new power, enabling him to paint fresh and vibrant large-scale works in his Keppel Street studio without direct access to the actual scene. &#145;The White Horse&#146;, well received by the reviewers, was purchased by Constable's friend Fisher for 100 guineas; and in November 1819 the artist was finally elected an associate of the academy.<h2>
<a name="SalisburyandHampsteadtheearly1820s"></a>Salisbury and Hampstead, the early 1820s</h2>The continued centrality of the Stour valley in Constable's life and art cannot be overstated, but from now until his death his visits there were infrequent and of short duration. No longer under pressure to stock his studio or his memory with East Anglian views, he drew or sketched when there, it would seem, simply because he could not restrain himself if he had materials with him and a site or an effect caught his eye. Never forsaking his commitment to the fundamental importance of outdoor study, however, he merely focused his attention&#151;and his affections&#151;on other locales.<br>
<br>After exhibiting his second &#145;six-footer&#146; in 1820, another canal scene bought this time by Fisher as a gift for his solicitor (<span class="italic">Stratford Mill</span>; National Gallery), Constable took Maria and the children to Salisbury for a long and idyllic summer visit. They stayed with Fisher, now a canon living in a spacious house in the close, from which Constable had ample opportunity to deepen his intimacy with the cathedral and its environs. His outdoor oil sketches and drawings, which included views of Stonehenge and Old Sarum, reveal a wide range of handling, from the closely detailed to the exuberantly free, and, in keeping with his standard procedure, would be consulted in subsequent years for works executed in his London studio (<span class="italic">Salisbury Cathedral from the Bishop's Grounds</span>, 1823, and <span class="italic">Stonehenge</span>, 1836; V&amp;A). This long visit intensified the already well-established friendship between Constable and Fisher. Their shared passion for landscape (Fisher was an amateur artist) and for their young families is fully revealed in their lengthy correspondence which, though ending with Fisher's early death in 1832, provides a poignant record of the joys and disappointments of Constable's private and professional life. Both men enjoyed a ribald sense of humour and indulged in satiric jibes at their colleagues, particularly those who brought their professions into disrepute. Only Constable's friendship with Leslie approached the closeness of his attachment to Fisher, and it is in his correspondence with these two men that his deeply held views about life and art are most fully articulated.<br>
<br>Immediately upon their return to London, Maria (pregnant again) was settled with the children in a house in Hampstead. Although he needed to work in his Keppel Street studio, Constable stayed with them when he could and, invigorated by the surrounding landscape, began a new campaign of open-air sketching that once again transformed his painting. Concentrating on views from Hampstead Heath, which served as a virtual meteorological observatory, he embarked on a series of sky studies that throughout the early 1820s would enhance his understanding of the natural phenomena so crucial to his vision of landscape art. Already very knowledgeable about weather and its effects from his practical experience in the family business, he pursued both theoretical and empirical confirmation of what he had learned. Certainly aware of the contemporary scientific work of Luke Howard and Thomas Forster, he treated the heath as a laboratory for his own experiments, painting between October 1820 and October 1822 over one hundred studies in which the sky is the chief feature. Many are annotated with the date and time, wind speed and direction, the preceding weather conditions and those that followed. &#145;His accurate studies match almost perfectly the contemporary weather records&#146;; despite the challenge of rapid, open-air oil sketching, &#145;he was able to capture those momentary glimpses of shape, process, colour and meteorological truth&#146;  (Thornes, 200).<br>
<br>Constable informed Fisher in October 1821 that he had &#145;done a good deal of skying&#146;, writing at great length about his attempts to conquer &#145;that most arduous&#146; difficulty faced by a landscape painter:<blockquote>if the Sky is <i>obtrusive</i>&#151;(as mine are) it is bad, but if they are <i>evaded</i> (as mine are not) it is worse &hellip; It will be difficult to name a class of Landscape, in which the sky is not the <i>&#145;key note&#146;</i>, the <i>standard of &#145;Scale&#146;</i>, and chief <i>&#145;Organ of sentiment&#146;</i> &hellip; The sky is the <i>&#145;source of light&#146;</i> in nature&#151;and governs every thing.(<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 6.76&#150;7; see also Thornes, 278&#150;82, for Fleming-Williams's sensitive decipherment of this exceptionally telling letter to savour the orthographic and punctuation complexities typical of Constable's prose.)</blockquote>The conjunction of art and science in his landscapes is perhaps most fully revealed in the effect Constable's &#145;skying&#146; had on his studio work at this time. What he learned at Hampstead enabled him to unite the sky and land to an unprecedented degree and illustrates a maxim he later expressed in one of his lectures: &#145;<i>We see nothing till we truly understand it</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Discourses</span>, 64).<br>
<br>Although Hampstead provided an occasional second home where Maria could recuperate, the birth of their third child in 1821 and the imminent arrival of another the following summer necessitated a larger London house for the family, prompting a move in June 1822 from Keppel Street to 35 Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square. The residence (now demolished) of the recently deceased Joseph Farington, it was a house Constable knew well and would remain his London home until his own death in 1837. Although it was preferable in many ways, Constable regretted leaving the house where he had painted four of his important &#145;six-footers&#146;: &#145;The 5 happiest &amp; most interesting years of my life&#146;, he told Fisher, &#145;were passed in Keppel St. I got my children and my fame in that house, neither of which would I exchange with any other man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 6.99).<h2>
<a name="Brightonthemid1820s"></a>Brighton, the mid-1820s</h2>Charlotte Street, though more agreeable in general, did little to restore Maria's health. Advised to &#145;try the sea&#146; in 1824, Constable took lodgings for the family in Brighton, the first of several extended stays there. Travelling down from London to be with them whenever he could, Constable loosed his creative energy on the sea shore with its bustling activity and windswept skies. Drawings and oil sketches, frequently annotated with temporal and meteorological details, record Constable's fascination with his new surroundings (<span class="italic">Brighton Beach, with Colliers</span>, V&amp;A). Not having had such sustained access to the coast since his honeymoon trip to Dorset in 1816, he was struck by the magnificence of the sea, though its &#145;everlasting voice&#146;, he told Fisher, was drowned by the din of the beach which was like &#145;Piccadilly by the sea-side&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 6.171). Undeterred, however, he drew and painted what passed before him in all its variety: the people, the boats, and the evanescent effects of sky and waves. In typical fashion, the stock of images produced here resurfaced in small studio works which were then used by Constable to construct the large-scale <span class="italic">Chain Pier, Brighton</span> (Tate collection), shown at the 1827 academy exhibition. Some reviewers, surprised by a &#145;six-footer&#146; devoted to a seaside resort rather than an inland canal, none the less praised Constable for its adherence to nature and freshness of colour. <span class="italic">The Times</span> thought it one of his best works and declared him &#145;unquestionably the first landscape painter of the day&#146;  (11 May 1827). The <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, however, found its colouring defective and thought it looked as if there were &#145;<i>streaks of ink</i> dashed across it&#146;  (20 June 1827).<h2>
<a name="ConstableandFrance"></a>Constable and France</h2>By the mid-1820s Constable's reputation in England was already marked by this troubling contradiction. Credited with originality, he was praised for not painting in the &#145;manner&#146; of any other artist. Yet his own &#145;mannerisms&#146;&#151;loose handling, bold impasto, and a certain &#145;spottiness&#146; that would come to be known as &#145;Constable's snow&#146; or whitewash&#151;were a cause of concern to reviewers, academicians, and potential patrons. What was perceived as his &#145;naturalism&#146; was hailed as his greatest strength, enabling him to capture the peculiarities of English landscape; but paradoxically his persistent concentration on the rural was thought to be repetitive, preventing his mastery of the more imaginative or &#145;poetic&#146; aspects of the landscape tradition.<br>
<br>While the English public dithered over Constable's strengths and weaknesses, the more radical factions of the French art world, in a flurry of enthusiastic support, revelled in his freshness and apparent rejection of staid landscape conventions. The first Frenchman to take notice was Charles Nodier who, having seen the third &#145;six-footer&#146;, <span class="italic">Landscape: Noon</span> (&#145;The Hay Wain&#146;), at the 1821 academy exhibition, published a rhapsodic report in his <span class="italic">Promenade de Dieppe aux montagnes d'&Eacute;cosse</span> (1821; Eng. trans., 1822, 49). Equally impressed, Am&eacute;d&eacute;e Pichot and Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault also sent word back to France that year. As news of their keen interest spread, it sparked the curiosity of two Parisian dealers, John Arrowsmith and Claude Schroth, who were responsible for a remarkable interlude in Constable's career. Arrowsmith, having seen &#145;The Hay Wain&#146; at the 1822 British Institution exhibition, purchased it in 1824 with a small Yarmouth scene and the fourth &#145;six-footer&#146;, <span class="italic">View on the Stour near Dedham</span> (1822; Huntington Gallery, San Marino, California). Both he and Schroth visited Constable's studio and commissioned several other paintings, and Arrowsmith then arranged for the two large canvases plus a small Hampstead view to be shown at the 1824 Paris Salon. Although conservative French critics were shocked by Constable's unorthodox handling and colour, the response was otherwise very positive and he was awarded a gold medal by Charles X at the close of the exhibition. Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix and Paul Huet, both directly influenced by Constable, credited him accordingly; and as his fame spread, he heard reports that his paintings had become something of a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>. Artists, he told Fisher in December 1824, showed:<blockquote>much desire to purchase them &amp; deposit them in a place in which they can have access to them &hellip; they have made a decided stir, and have set all the students in landscape thinking&#151;they say on going to begin a landscape, Oh! this shall be&#151;<i>a la</i> <i>Constable</i>!!! (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 6.185&#150;6)</blockquote>A year later Constable reported to Fisher that Arrowsmith had &#145;a room in his house called Mr. Constable's room &hellip; He says my landscapes have made an epoch there&#146;  (ibid., 6. 209).<br>
<br>Unfortunately, events conspired to halt the flow of Constable's paintings to the continent. Offended one afternoon by Arrowsmith's impertinence, the artist severed relations in a fit of pique (instantly regretting the loss of income). Although both dealers ceased trading within a few years anyway, Constable continued to hear reports of his influence abroad. Having sent two paintings to an exhibition in Lille, he was notified in 1826 that he had been awarded another gold medal; and in 1827 he sent <span class="italic">The Cornfield</span> (1826; National Gallery) to the Paris Salon. That same year, Arrowsmith's <span class="italic">View on the Stour near Dedham</span> was shown in Douai; in 1833 Constable exhibited a version of <span class="italic">A Barge Passing a Lock</span> in Brussels and in 1834 he was invited to exhibit again in Lille. In 1835 Thomas Uwins reported that there was &#145;no English painter's name known so well&#146; in France as Constable's  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 5.179). There is still much to be discovered about Constable's impact on nineteenth-century French art. Historians, responding to Delacroix's enthusiastic comments in his journals, may have on occasion overestimated Constable's influence on subsequent developments in French landscape painting; but that he generated during his own lifetime a greater frisson among the artists in France than those in England, that he showed them effects of light and atmosphere they had never yet seen, is incontrovertible.<h2>
<a name="Thelate1820s"></a>The late 1820s</h2>An associate of the academy since 1819, Constable sought full membership on several occasions, and failed. He had, none the less, made substantial progress in his profession; and, if there were few people who understood precisely what he was trying to achieve, there were several who spoke of his &#145;genius&#146; and originality. Sales were increasing; unfortunately so were his expenses. A fifth child had been born in 1825, a sixth in 1826. Maria's consumption, compounded by so many pregnancies, was worsening; and in 1827, with Maria pregnant yet again, Constable transferred the family permanently to Hampstead where he leased 6 Well Walk, keeping only his studio and a few rooms in Charlotte Street for his own use. &#145;Our little drawing room commands a view unequalled in Europe&#146;, he told Fisher, pleading in the same letter for a loan of &pound;100  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 6.231). His financial worries were alleviated in 1828, however, by an inheritance of &pound;20,000 from Maria's father, but she had little time to enjoy it. She died on 23 November, leaving Constable with seven children under the age of eleven. &#145;The face of the World is totally changed to me&#146;, he told his brother  (<span class="italic">Further Documents and Correspondence</span>, 81). Three months later, aged fifty-two, he was finally elected a full member of the academy. &#145;It has been delayed until I am solitary, and cannot impart it&#146;  (Leslie, 1845, 186).<br>
<br>Throughout this decade Constable had confined his exhibited studio works to those places he knew best, but he was becoming less tied to the topographical accuracy of the previous decade and intensifying the expressive robustness of his handling, particularly in his use of the palette knife to create surface texture. In <span class="italic">The Leaping Horse</span> (1825; RA) Constable had come close to &#145;an abstracted art, and part of the brilliance of his effect is in the tension created through his efforts to force this into a figurative one&#146;  (Rosenthal, 164&#150;6). This tension is particularly evident in <span class="italic">Hadleigh Castle</span> (Yale Center for British Art, New Haven), exhibited at the 1829 academy within months of Maria's death. Simultaneously expressive and descriptive, Constable's brushwork combines with the palette knife to create an ode to melancholy and ruin. Reviewers, stunned by its power, were none the less perplexed by its surface texture which was likened to chopped hay and whitewash. Abuse of a personal nature began this year when the critic Edward Dubois credited Constable's academy membership to his recent acquisition of wealth. His attacks on Constable's merit and integrity continued in the following decade; and he, with several other reviewers, intensified their light-hearted (and occasionally mean-spirited) ridicule of Constable's increasingly rough and broken handling  (Ivy, <span class="italic">Constable and the Critics</span>, 14&#150;56).<h2>
<a name="Themezzotints"></a>The mezzotints</h2>Constable, unlike many contemporary landscape painters, had very little contact with the print publishing industry or the burgeoning illustrated-book trade; and when he decided shortly after Maria's death to have several of his paintings and sketches engraved, he retained absolute control over the entire publishing venture. Choosing mezzotint as the process most suited to translate his bold handling and to convey his thoughts about the importance of chiaroscuro in landscape art, he engaged David Lucas to engrave <span class="italic">Various Subjects of Landscape, Characteristic of English Scenery</span> (generally known as <span class="italic">English Landscape</span>). Initially published between 1830 and 1832 in five separate parts and reissued in 1833 with several pages of letterpress text, it contained twenty-two mezzotints, all of which progressed from first proof to published state amid much dithering and petulance on Constable's part and infinite patience on Lucas's. Several more plates were planned as an appendix, six of which were issued just after Constable's death. Throughout their collaboration, which is chronicled in a remarkable series of letters  (Shirley, 16&#150;151, and <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 4.314&#150;463), Constable interfered constantly, never actually working on the steel himself but doing everything he could to shape the gradually emerging black and white images as they developed from proof to proof. The autobiographical visual imagery, particularly in the <span class="italic">Frontispiece</span> (his birthplace) and the <span class="italic">Vignette</span> (Hampstead Heath), represents a genre of self-referential landscape that might be called &#145;egotistical topography&#146;; coupled with the plates, the letterpress in <span class="italic">English Landscape</span> (his &#145;book&#146; as he called it) virtually serves as Constable's apologia and manifesto. As he explained to Leslie, &#145;many can read print &amp; cannot read mezzotint&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 3.108). Lucas also engraved six large plates after Constable, but only <span class="italic">Hadleigh Castle</span> and <span class="italic">Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows</span> were fully collaborative, though not published until after his death.<h2>
<a name="Thelastyears18301837"></a>The last years, 1830&#150;1837</h2>Concern for his children, grief for the loss of his wife, bouts of ill health caused by rheumatism and anxiety about the perceived threats to both state and church (as someone so politically conservative and anti-reform as Constable would have viewed the impending changes) plagued the last years of his life. Much of his time was taken up with duties at the academy (serving on the council and exhibition hanging committees and as visitor in the life academy) and as a director of the Artists' General Benevolent Institution with which he had been actively involved since 1818. Between 1833 and 1836 he delivered several lectures on the history of landscape painting at the Literary and Scientific Society of Hampstead, the Worcester Literary and Scientific Institution, and the Royal Institution in London, the last drawing eminent scientists and literary figures including Faraday and Wordsworth. In 1836 he was elected a member of both the Royal Institution and the Graphic Society. His outdoor work was severely limited during the 1830s, but he sketched or drew when the opportunity arose: at Hampstead, Worcester, Petworth (where he had been invited by Lord Egremont), Folkestone (where his two eldest sons were in school), and Arundel on the Sussex coast. His large exhibited works did not sell, but he had lately cultivated a reputation as someone reluctant to part with his paintings, preferring to retain them for his studio gallery and as future property for his children. Critics, bothered and bewildered by his increasingly unorthodox, rough, and &#145;frittered&#146; handling, were none the less bewitched by his effects. Apparently unconvinced that the handling was necessary for the effects, they assumed that underneath late paintings like <span class="italic">Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows</span> (1831; National Gallery), <span class="italic">The Opening of Waterloo Bridge</span> (1832; Tate collection), and <span class="italic">The Valley Farm</span> (1835; Tate collection) there lurked a <i>real</i> naturalism wilfully spoiled by Constable's final layer of scumbling and highly textured impasto.<br>
<br>Seriously depressed by the deaths in 1832 of Fisher and John Dunthorne junior, who had served as his studio assistant for several years, Constable still derived great pleasure from his children and his art, although his correspondence reveals an underlying disquietude. On the evening of 31 March 1837, after returning to Charlotte Street from a charitable errand, he became ill, suffering from giddiness and sickness during the night. He died in the early hours of 1 April; despite a post-mortem the cause of death was not determined. His death mask preserves the strong features of a man known in his youth as &#145;the handsome miller&#146;. Constable was buried with his wife in the churchyard of St John's, Hampstead, and left an estate valued at &pound;25,000 to his seven children, all of whom were still minors. In the absence of a will, Constable's elder brother Golding and a cousin by marriage, Lancelot Archer-Burton, were with the consent of the family elected to administer the estate and act as guardians for the children, one of whom (Charles Golding) had gone to sea in 1835 at the age of fourteen and at the time of his father's death was on an East Indiaman bound for Bombay. When Constable's eldest son, John Charles, came of age in December 1838, he assumed responsibility for the estate and at his early death in 1841 his eldest sister, Maria Louisa, took his place. Several of Constable's children possessed artistic ability, particularly the youngest, Lionel Bicknell, whose works were for many years misattributed to his father. Subsequent generations descending from Charles Golding, Constable's only child to have children of his own, have produced both amateur and professional artists.<h2>
<a name="TheposthumousreputationandcriticalheritagethediscoveryofConstable"></a>The posthumous reputation and critical heritage: the discovery of Constable</h2>Constable's children may have inherited their grandfather's wealth, but more important for the future of their father's reputation, they inherited his life's work. During his career he sold relatively little of what he produced, and his house was filled with not only the finished paintings, but all the preparatory sketches and drawings and the usual studio detritus surrounding an extremely active artistic life of almost forty years. An auction in 1838 dispersed some of the paintings, but the vast majority stayed with the family. Fleming-Williams and Parris's exhaustive study <span class="italic">The Discovery of Constable</span> exposes the copies, forgeries, and misattributions that have complicated Constable studies and traces the crucial sales, exhibitions, and bequests to the national collections that account for the growing public consciousness of his art up to the 1930s. Throughout that period he was either praised or denigrated because of his painting style, valued or vilified according to prevailing tastes. Ruskin compared him unfavourably with Turner; Delacroix declared him the &#145;father&#146; of modern French landscape. Leslie's <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life of John Constable</span>, first published in 1843 in a limited edition (and illustrated with impressions from <span class="italic">English Landscape</span>), was republished in a cheaper, smaller format in 1845 and has since been reissued numerous times. Drawn primarily from the artist's letters, Leslie's hagiographic biography established a private and professional persona for Constable with which subsequent biographers and historians have had to contend. Leslie virtually created a Constable whose development was a personal journey of self-discovery and whose art was purely and simply &#145;natural&#146; in its devotion to an unmediated experience of English landscape. At the turn of the twentieth century, historians shifted their interest to Constable's sketches and studies, but continued to view him as an &#145;innocent eye&#146;, a Wordsworth of landscape painting; but just as literary criticism increasingly unearthed layers of meaning in Wordsworth's poetry, so art historians began a reassessment of Constable's art, placing it within a wider cultural context. By the middle of the twentieth century it became obvious that landscape art (even when &#145;unpeopled&#146;) signifies more than the land depicted. Literary, geographical, agricultural, scientific, political, religious, and psychosocial perspectives are all now regularly applied to the &#145;reading&#146; of Constable's <i>&#339;uvre</i>, aided by the eight volumes of correspondence and related documents published between 1962 and 1975 by the Suffolk Records Society. Inspired by John Barrell's 1980 seminal study, <span class="italic">The Dark Side of the Landscape</span>, many Constable scholars have sought to reinterpret the &#145;naturalism&#146; of his art, rejecting the idea that any landscape painter in eighteenth- or nineteenth-century Britain could have approached a rural setting in a pure, simple, or unmediated manner. Their conclusions have not lessened the perceived importance of Constable to the development of landscape painting, nor the public's fondness for his art; but they have shown that an art created for the public arena and for posterity, as Constable's was, inevitably signifies something beyond the artist's private journey toward self-discovery, toward that &#145;natural painture&#146; he had sought since 1802.<br>
<br>Although historiographical interpretations of Constable have changed enormously since his death, the works themselves have for the most part suffered only those changes attributable to &#145;the mellowing hand of Time&#146;, incompetent and misguided restoration, or later overpainting. He frequently reworked his paintings (even after their sale on occasion) and, especially in the early years, reused canvases; but, as Sarah Cove's research has shown  (Cove, 493&#150;516), Constable was acutely knowledgeable about his materials, their limitations and potential. He was experimental in his handling, but not careless in his working methods nor unaware of the dangers of ignoring traditional wisdom. His library contained theoretical treatises and practical manuals, and his friendship with the colourman George Field ensured that he kept up with the latest developments in materials and techniques. Consequently, his works are in remarkably good condition and have consistently increased in value. When they come onto the market, paintings that sold for hundreds of pounds or less during his lifetime now sell for millions, drawings for tens of thousands. Constable only occasionally signed his finished works; sketches and drawings are frequently inscribed with notes, though not necessarily with his signature or initials.<h2>
<a name="Publicandprivatecollections"></a>Public and private collections</h2>The complete range of Constable's work can be seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum, which received an incomparable and sensitively selected bequest in 1888 from his last surviving child, Isobel Constable. She had also arranged gifts to supplement the holdings of the National Gallery, the Royal Academy, and the British Museum (department of prints and drawings), which already owned a choice selection of the mezzotints. Prime examples of his work are to be found in many other institutions including: the Tate collection; the National Gallery, Washington; the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven; the Frick Collection, New York; the Huntington Gallery, San Marino, California; the Art Institute of Chicago; the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In addition to paintings, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Metropolitan Museum, New York, the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, all have extensive collections of the mezzotints, particularly the last which owns much of what remained in Lucas's studio, the prints as well as the correspondence from Constable. Many works are still in private collections, both in Britain and abroad.<br>
<br>In 1923 the London county council marked Constable's house in Well Walk (now numbered 40) with a blue plaque. His birthplace was demolished long ago, but &#145;Constable country&#146;, particularly East Bergholt, Flatford, and Dedham, has been part of the heritage industry since at least the 1890s when Thomas Cook Ltd first arranged tours there.<br>
