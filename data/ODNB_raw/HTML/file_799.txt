<span class="headword">Askew,  Anthony</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1722, <em>d.</em> 1774), <span class="occ">physician and book collector</span>, was born in Kendal, Westmorland, where he was baptized on 7 May 1722, the son of Adam Askew, physician, and his wife, Anne Crackenthorp. In 1725 his family moved to Newcastle, where his father established a well-respected practice. Askew was educated at Sedbergh School and then at Newcastle Free School, under the eminent classicist Richard Dawes. In 1741 he matriculated from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, whence he graduated MB in 1745. Intended for the medical profession, he studied at Leiden University from 1745 to 1746 and then spent the next three years travelling to Hungary, Athens, Constantinople, Italy, and other countries. During his time abroad he purchased a large number of books and manuscripts that formed the basis of his extensive library, the Bibliotheca Askeviana. Having returned to England he was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1749, and in 1750 he began practising medicine at Cambridge and graduated MD. He soon afterwards established himself in London and was appointed physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1754. In the previous year he had been elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, and he served as its registrar from 1767 until his death. He married twice. His first wife, whom he married at Hartburn, Northumberland, on 15 November 1751, was Margaret, daughter of Cuthburt Swinburn of Longwitton, Northumberland; the marriage was childless. Askew married secondly, in 1757, Elizabeth (1734&#150;1773), younger daughter of Robert Holford, master in chancery; they had twelve children.<br>
<br>Askew was a keen and accomplished classical scholar whose love of Greek literature was probably stimulated by his teacher Richard Dawes. His favourite author was Aeschylus and he planned to publish a new and complete critical edition of his works but, apart from a brief proposal and specimen of the work published in 1746, nothing came of the project. This pamphlet was Askew's only publication. His principal contribution to scholarship lay in his outstanding collection of manuscripts and books that was crammed &#145;from cellar to garret&#146; into his house in Queen Square, London  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>). The collection was chiefly classical and it was Askew's ambition to own every edition of a Greek author, which he achieved in the case of Aeschylus. His librarian was John Caravella, who in 1822 published a verbal index to Aristophanes taken from one of a series in Askew's library.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Askew died on 2 August 1773 and Askew died at his home in Hampstead on 27 February 1774; he was buried in Hampstead church. His young family was left in the care of his brother, Henry Askew. His library of almost 7000 books was auctioned over twenty days in February and March the following year and fetched nearly &pound;4000; among the principal purchasers were George III, Louis XV, and the British Museum. The manuscripts were sold separately in 1785. An appendix to Dr Charles Burney's edition of Johannes Scapula's <span class="italic">Lexicon Graeco-Latinum</span> was taken from Askew's manuscript collection, and Samuel Butler made use of his collections in compiling his edition of Aeschylus (4 vols., 1809&#150;16). Askew's scholarly credentials, however, were criticized by Charles James Blomfield, who discovered that a volume in Askew's handwriting, which contained a collation of five codices, was a transcript from a volume in Peter Needham's handwriting. None the less John Nichols concluded that &#145;the benefit the public received by the dissemination of his collection of scarce and valuable manuscripts and books give him a just title to be regarded among the promoters of literature and science&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 3.496).<br>
