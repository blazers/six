<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gordon family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1300&#150;<em>c.</em>1400), <span class="occ">nobility</span>, held the Berwickshire baronies of Gordon and Huntly during the fourteenth century. At that time a family of middling significance, the Gordons are also important as the progenitors of the earls of Huntly and dukes of Gordon who dominated the north of Scotland from the mid-fifteenth century. They first came to prominence in the person of <a name="cosubject_11011"></a><span class="headword">Sir Adam Gordon</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1328)<span class="occ"></span>, lord of Gordon, in the early fourteenth century. A leading Scottish supporter of Edward I and Edward II, he held the offices of warden of the east march and justiciar of Lothian for the English crown. He fought against Robert Bruce (Robert I) at Methven in 1306, and acted as the warden of Sir Thomas Randolph (Bruce's nephew, later earl of Moray) after Randolph's capture by the English in 1308. Sir Adam was a late defector to the Scottish cause, not joining King Robert until 1315, but his experience was utilized quickly, and in 1320 he travelled to Avignon as one of the bearers of the declaration of Arbroath to Pope John XXII (<i>r</i>. 1316&#150;34).<br>
<br>At an unknown date Sir Adam received from the king the extensive lordship of Strathbogie in Aberdeenshire, no doubt partly as a reward for his diplomatic services. The grant may also have been influenced by his former ward Sir Thomas Randolph who sought some measure of security on the borders of his great earldom of Moray, created for him by King Robert in 1312. A few years earlier, in 1315, Randolph had granted the lands of Stichill in Roxburghshire to Adam Gordon, and the two seem to have been reasonably close. Sir Adam's wife was named Amabilla; her family is unknown. With her Sir Adam had four sons and one daughter. He died in or about 1328 and his eldest son, Sir Adam Gordon, succeeded him, was involved in border raids in the 1320s, and fought at Halidon Hill in 1333. The first Sir Adam's second son, William, inherited the lands of Stichill, and was the ancestor of the Gordons of Lochinvar, viscounts Kenmure.<br>
<br>The Gordons largely disappeared from national politics over the following half century, and the next family member of note was <a name="cosubject_54210"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Gordon</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1391<span class="mult">x</span>5)<span class="occ"></span>, the great-grandson of the elder Sir Adam. Like his predecessors John Gordon was primarily concerned with the family's Berwickshire lands. He was involved in a major raid against the English at Roxburgh fair in the 1370s, and as part of the skirmishing that resulted from this attack John led a force across the Tweed in order to raid English cattle. He was overtaken by a larger force led by Sir John Lilburn before he could recross the river, and was forced to fight at Carham. Despite the uneven odds Gordon emerged victorious, capturing Lilburn and his brother and being &#145;gretly pryssit&#146; for his deeds. Despite receiving serious wounds during this raid, Gordon was still able to continue his defensive role on the borders, and in a second major incident, in 1378, he and his followers intercepted and defeated a force led by Sir Thomas Musgrave (<i>d</i>. 1385), warden of Berwick, who was riding to join an expedition led by Henry Percy, earl of Northumberland (<i>d</i>. 1408), against the lands of the earl of March. In 1388 he fought alongside the earl of Douglas at the battle of Otterburn.<br>
<br>The 1390s saw the first known involvement of the Gordons with north-east Scotland, when Sir John was a royal justiciar appointed to resolve a dispute between Gilbert Greenlaw, bishop of Aberdeen, and Sir John Forbes, lord of that ilk. It seems unlikely that Gordon had been in the north-east long, and his presence was probably connected to a period of relative quiet on the Scottish border. It is not clear whether Gordon returned south again, but he died between 30 May 1391 and 11 October 1395. He was not legally married, although he had two sons, John and Thomas, through a &#145;handfasting&#146; marriage to Elizabeth Cruickshank, daughter of the laird of Aswanley. It may have been the desire to gain the support of the descendants of these sons that encouraged Alexander Seton, first earl of Huntly (<i>d</i>. 1470)&#151;the son of Sir Alexander Seton and Elizabeth Gordon&#151;to change his family name to Gordon in or about 1457.<br>
<br>Sir John was succeeded as lord of Gordon by his brother <a name="cosubject_11012"></a><span class="headword">Sir Adam Gordon</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1402)<span class="occ"></span> who again concentrated on the family's border interests. In October 1398 Adam Gordon was one of three men excepted from a free exchange of prisoners between the Scots and the English, and was cited as a common truce-breaker. He was ordered to appear at the next meeting of the border commissioners in order to answer for the &#145;unmesurit harmes&#146; he had done, under pain of a fine of &pound;1000. Gordon's activities may have been related to attempts to pay the debts incurred by financing the relief duty on Strathbogie, which had been set by Robert III at 700 merks. In 1399 Gordon was still in debt, and is found borrowing money from a border ally, William Barde, laird of Kirkwood. He fought at Homildon Hill on 14 September 1402, when he invaded England alongside the earl of Douglas. The occasion seems to have been the catalyst for the reconciliation of a long-term feud with Sir John Swinton, who knighted Sir Adam on the battlefield. The two men then led a charge against the English line but were overpowered and killed in the process. Adam Gordon was married to Elisabeth Keith, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15275/', "Sir William Keith (d. in or after 1407)")</script>, marischal of Scotland [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54235/', "Keith family")</script>]. With Elisabeth he had a son and heir, John Gordon, and a daughter, Elizabeth Gordon; the latter married Sir Alexander Seton, second son of Sir William Seton [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54318/', "Seton family")</script>], and inherited the Gordon lands on the death of her brother on or before 7 March 1408, thereby establishing the line of the Setons of Gordon.<br>
