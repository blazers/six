<span class="headword">Blundell,  James</span>  (1790&#150;1878), <span class="occ">physician and physiologist</span>, was born in London on 27 December 1790. Educated first by the Revd Thomas Thomason, and then at the United Borough Hospitals by his maternal uncle, the physiologist John Haighton, he graduated MD at Edinburgh in 1813. Haighton proved to be a great influence on his nephew, who lived with him for some time. From 1814 Blundell lectured in London on midwifery in conjunction with his uncle, and soon after began to lecture on physiology. In 1818 he succeeded his uncle as lecturer in midwifery and as lecturer in physiology at Guy's Hospital. As professor of obstetricy and lecturer on the diseases of women he was reputed to have the largest classes in midwifery in London. He was the author of <span class="italic">Researches Physiological and Pathological</span> (1824) and two papers on abdominal surgery and blood transfusion, edited by S. Ashwell, and published in 1828; the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> considered him to be the father of the operation of transfusion in Britain. He also published <span class="italic">Principles and Practice of Obstetricy</span> (1834) and <span class="italic">Observations on some of the More Important Diseases of Women</span> (1837). He was considered to be in advance of other obstetric practitioners, not least in using the uterine sound for diagnostic purposes.<br>
<br>Blundell left Guy's in 1834 following a dispute with the hospital's treasurer. He became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1838. Blundell, who retained an interest in the classics from his days with Thomason, published his <span class="italic">Hexametrical experiments, or, A version of four of Virgil's pastorals &hellip; with hints to explain the method of reading, and a slight essay on the laws of metre</span> in the same year. With a large private practice and significant bequests, he amassed a fortune estimated variously at between a third of and half a million pounds, and was thus able to retire from full-time practice in 1847. During his later years he never rose until around noon, saw patients during the afternoon, dined, and commenced visits at 8 or 9 pm. He always carried books with him on his rounds, reading them by means of a light specially installed in his carriage.<br>
<br>Blundell died on 15 January 1878 at his home at 80 Piccadilly, London.<br>
