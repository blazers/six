<span class="headword">Lawson,  Henry John</span>  (1852&#150;1925), <span class="occ">bicycle designer and company promoter</span>, was born at 1 Nevills Court in the City of London on 23 February 1852, the son of Thomas Lawson, brass turner and Calvinistic Methodist minister, and his wife, Ann Lucy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kent. Little is known about Lawson's early life, but he followed his father as a mechanical model maker in London and then appears to have gained experience in the bicycle trade in Brighton as a young man. He married, on 25 January 1879, at the Providence Chapel, Brighton, Elizabeth (Lizzie) (<i>b</i>. 1850), daughter of George Olliver, carpenter. They had two daughters and two sons.<br>
<br>Lawson's adult life falls into three distinct phases, of which the first was active and inventive involvement in the cycle trade and industry, when he contributed to the complex and gradual evolution of the safety bicycle. In the second phase he turned to company finance, initially in the related areas of cycles and pneumatic tyres, but culminating in the motor industry, which in its early years was closely related to them. After the collapse of his profiteering and monopolistic schemes, the last years of his life seem to have been spent in obscurity and poverty.<br>
<br>In 1873&#150;4 Lawson designed a safety bicycle, described as the &#145;first authentic design of safety bicycle employing chain-drive to the rear wheel which was actually made&#146;  (Caunter, 34). In 1876 the Likeman and Lawson low bicycle was patented, with a large rear wheel and powered by pedals and levers. It superficially resembled a back to front Ordinary or penny-farthing machine, but with an easier riding position; a few were made by Haynes and Jefferis of Coventry. The Bicyclette, Lawson's third design, appeared in 1879. This more closely resembled the Ordinary machine in having a larger front wheel, but its smaller size, improved distribution of the rider's weight, and chain drive permit Lawson to be classed with others, above all John Kemp Starley, as a progenitor of the modern safety bicycle which was central to the boom of the mid-1890s. Lawson had become manager of the Tangent and Coventry Tricycle Company, but appears not to have had plans to manufacture his own design, approaching BSA, who produced two prototypes only.<br>
<br>In 1884 Lawson patented a lady's safety bicycle, but then entered the second phase of his life, for which he was to become notorious, that of company promotion. In 1887 the Haynes and Jefferis concern was transformed into the Rudge Cycle Company, Lawson acting with the Coventry solicitor George Woodcock. The latter died in 1891, but by then Lawson's role in company promotion was linked to those of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37564/', "E. T. Hooley")</script> and his associate, Martin Rucker. Their activities stemmed from a desire to benefit from the exceptionally favourable market conditions by obtaining capital gains in cash through company flotations. However, Lawson went on into new fields with a scheme &#145;to create a motor car industry in this country and to control it himself&#146;  (Richardson, 17).<br>
<br>Lawson floated the British Motor Syndicate Ltd in 1895 (this subsequently became the British Motor Company Ltd, then the British Motor Traction Company Ltd), followed in 1896 by the Great Horseless Carriage Company Ltd (subsequently the Motor Manufacturing Company Ltd). The reality failed to match these grandiose titles or Lawson's greedy ambition, with one exception: the Daimler Motor Company (re-formed in 1904) proved to be an enduring outcome of Lawson's schemes. The Daimler patent rights had been bought from F. R. Simms's Daimler Motor Syndicate by the British Motor Syndicate in 1895 and sold in 1896 to the Daimler Motor Company which was based in Coventry.<br>
<br>For the embryonic automotive industry, there were no profits records to assess and scarcely any measure of current demand. In such a situation, a showman&#150;promoter like Lawson could flourish, at least temporarily. The Motor Car Club, which Lawson founded in late 1895, may be regarded as part of his publicity machine, and the more responsible element in the motor world, including F. R. Simms, found it desirable to create the independent Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland (later the RAC) in mid-1897.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Lawson continued his scheme of monopoly. To the Daimler rights he added those of the American inventor E. J. Pennington (1858&#150;1911), which were of doubtful value. Their joint Anglo-American Rapid Vehicle Company, organized in the United States in 1899, collapsed. In July 1901 the death blow to Lawson's schemes was delivered by Mr Justice Farwell in a High Court decision; he dismissed an action by the British Motor Traction Company for alleged infringement of Maybach's carburettor patent, on the grounds that Maybach's method had been anticipated by both Edward Butler and George Wilkinson.<br>
<br>A receiver was appointed to the Traction Company in February 1903 and in the following year Lawson was indicted with Hooley for conspiring to defraud a speculator, Alfred Paine, and also shareholders and creditors of the Electric Tramways Construction and Maintenance Company Ltd. Hooley, defended by Rufus Isaacs, was acquitted, but Lawson, who conducted his own case, was sentenced to one year's hard labour. By then in his fifties, Lawson thereafter seems to have faded from the motor world and the public scene, until the Bl&eacute;riot affair of 1915&#150;16. In this Lawson again played the syndicate card, acquiring the Bl&eacute;riot Manufacturing Aircraft Company Ltd on 17 June 1915, a few days before the issue of a prospectus which gave no indication that control had in effect passed into Lawson's hands. The company was wound up in 1916 following an extraordinary general meeting marked by some disorder. Lawson died at his home, 25 Roxborough Avenue, Harrow, Middlesex, on 12 July 1925, summed up by the <span class="italic">Motor</span> as &#145;poor&#146; Harry J. Lawson, although it charitably commented that his chief fault was that &#145;his optimism was twenty-five years before the times&#146;  (cited in <span class="italic">DBB</span>).<br>
