<span class="headword">Donaldson, Sir  James</span>  (1831&#150;1915), <span class="occ">educationist and classical and patristic scholar</span>, was born in the Aberdeen area on 26 April 1831, son of James Donaldson (of whom nothing certain is known) and Christina McKay (subsequently married in 1849 to William Hannan, a widower). He was educated from 1842 at Aberdeen grammar school and from 1846 at Marischal College, Aberdeen, where he became a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of John Stuart Blackie, professor of Latin. After graduation he commenced training at New College, London, intending to become a Congregational minister. However, he already had other interests both in classical scholarship and the theory of education; moreover he studied also in Berlin, where he encountered the educational ideas of J. F. Herbart.<br>
<br>In 1852 Donaldson abandoned New College to become assistant to Blackie, now professor of Greek at Edinburgh. At this time, many ideas long to dominate Donaldson's thinking were shaped. He owed much to Blackie: his interest in post-classical Greek (shown by an early publication, <span class="italic">Modern Greek Grammar</span> (1853) intended for classics students, and a contribution to <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> on Byzantine and neo-Hellenic literature); his admiration for the German educational tradition and for German views on the psychology of education; and perhaps also the ideological foundations for his Scottish nationalism, which was to emerge in his support for home rule for Scotland, and for his liberal politics, source of powerful support later in his career. On 4 January 1855 he married Margaret Kennedy (<i>d</i>. 1887), with whom he had two sons, born in 1857 and 1859.<br>
<br>After two years (1854&#150;6) as rector of Stirling high school, Donaldson moved to Edinburgh high school where he was a classics master for ten years and rector from 1866 to 1882. In these years he made his main contributions to scholarship. His <span class="italic">Critical History of Christian Literature and Doctrine from the Death of the Apostles to the Nicene Council</span> appeared in three volumes between 1864 and 1866, the first, <span class="italic">The Apostolic Fathers</span>, in 1864 (2nd edn, 1874), and the remaining two, <span class="italic">The Apologists</span>, in 1866. With Alexander Roberts he edited and contributed to the twenty-four volumes of <span class="italic">The Ante-Nicene Christian Library</span> (1867&#150;72). He also published <span class="italic">Lectures on the History of Education in Prussia and England</span> (1874). Donaldson's educational activity extended beyond practice to history and theory, and beyond schools to universities. He was ambitious and highly political. He expressed strong objections to the <span class="roman">Education (Scotland) Act</span> of 1872, in particular to the importation of &#145;English&#146; ideas and the loss of the parish tradition. In 1882 he became professor of humanity in the University of Aberdeen where he continued to pursue his wide interests in education and assiduously cultivated his aristocratic contacts. At this time he opposed the foundation of teachers' training colleges, believing that the training of teachers should be done within universities.<br>
<br>Donaldson's appointment to the Aberdeen chair was widely viewed as having been engineered by his friend and powerful patron, Lord Rosebery; and his appointment four years later as principal of United College at the University of St Andrews (when the previous dual principalship, of St Mary's and of United College, came to an end) was attended by highly controversial political manoeuvrings. Donaldson's continued active involvement in Liberal politics was recognized in 1910 when he was one of the Liberals whom Asquith intended to create peers, to secure the passing of the <span class="roman">Parliament Act</span>.<br>
<br>After an inauspicious and unpopular start Donaldson proved an effective and forceful principal at a time of great expansion and change; his astute and pragmatic administrative style emerges in his public addresses, published in 1911. The implementation of the provisions of the <span class="roman">Universities (Scotland) Act</span> of 1889 engaged his energies in the early years. He presided over the difficult and protracted negotiations on the rival merits of incorporation or affiliation of University College, Dundee; these ended in 1897 with union (which he had favoured). Thereafter came a time of expansion, when Donaldson successfully raised money for extensive building projects. Notable benefactors were the marquess of Bute and Andrew Carnegie, successive rectors in this era. During Donaldson's term of office, in 1892, women were first admitted to degrees. It may have been the &#145;woman question&#146; which prompted his revision and publication of earlier papers in the form of <span class="italic">Woman: her Position and Influence in Ancient Greece and Rome, and among the Early Christians</span> (1907), his last classical work.<br>
<br>After the death of his first wife Donaldson married again in 1890. His second wife, Mary Christie (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Webster, first married name Laing), had twice been widowed and predeceased him in 1908. Donaldson was knighted in 1907, and continued his work as principal until a few weeks before his death, at his home in Scores Park, St Andrews, on 10 March 1915.<br>
