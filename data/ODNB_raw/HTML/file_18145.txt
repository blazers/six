<span class="headword">Marshall,  John</span>  (1818&#150;1891), <span class="occ">surgeon and teacher of anatomy</span>, was born on 11 September 1818 at Ely, Cambridgeshire, the second son and third child of William Marshall (1776&#150;1842) and his second wife, Ann Cropley (<i>c</i>.1793&#150;1861), also of Ely. William Marshall was a successful solicitor, whose eldest son, also William (1815&#150;1890), took over the legal practice. The Marshalls were a long-established Ely family, and even after John settled in London, he often brought his family back for extended holiday stays there.<br>
<br>The law being chosen for the elder son's career, medicine became John's option. He received his schooling in Hingham, Norfolk, and was then apprenticed to a Mr Wales, a surgeon and general practitioner in Wisbech. In 1838 he enrolled in University College, London, where he enjoyed a distinguished career as a student, winning a gold medal in physiology under William Sharpey, and becoming a private assistant to the surgeon Robert Liston. He also obtained the post (1842) of curator of the anatomy museum, which was followed in 1845 by a demonstratorship in anatomy. He assisted Richard Quain in producing the 1848 edition of <span class="italic">Elements of Anatomy</span> (&#145;Quain's Anatomy&#146;, the early editions having been written by Jones Quain, Richard Quain's brother).<br>
<br>In 1844 Marshall set up in practice in Mornington Crescent, where he befriended Ford Madox Brown, the first of a number of artists who became his friends and patients. In the same year he became MRCS, and the fellowship in the Royal College of Surgeons followed in 1849. By then he was an assistant surgeon (1847) at University College Hospital. He was subsequently full surgeon and in 1866 he succeeded Eric Erichsen to the chair in surgery, a post for which Joseph Lister also applied. Marshall, who was elected FRS in 1857, retired from University College Hospital and the Brompton Hospital, where he was also surgeon, in 1884. On 12 October 1854 he married Ellen Rogers (1831&#150;1919), daughter of Charles Williams (1792&#150;1865), with whom he had two sons and two daughters. One son died young. Except for a period when they rented a villa in what was then the airy suburb of Kentish Town, so that the children might have more space, the family lived at 10 Savile Row, near Piccadilly. Shortly before Marshall's death, he bought a fine house in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea.<br>
<br>Marshall was a competent but traditional surgeon, much of whose private practice was more of the nature of general practice. He pioneered the surgical excision of varicose veins and was an early advocate of Listerian antisepsis, but he contributed little to the surgical literature. His most successful publications were intended for more general audiences. <span class="italic">A Description of the Human Body</span> (1860, 4th edn, 1882) summarized anatomy and physiology for schoolteachers and their pupils, especially those intending to study medicine. <span class="italic">Outlines of Physiology: Human and Comparative</span> (1867) was aimed at medical students, but its morphological approach was soon superseded by the newer experimental physiology. <span class="italic">Anatomy for Artists</span> (1878, 3rd edn, 1890) grew out of his long-standing interest in artistic anatomy, a subject he taught at the government school, first at Marlborough House, and then at South Kensington. He became professor of anatomy at the Royal Academy in 1873, his candidacy being supported by one of his patients, Dante Gabriel Rossetti. He lectured on artistic anatomy to classes of men and women, and also pioneered the teaching of physiology at University College, London, to mixed classes. Consistent with his liberal principles, he encouraged his daughters to attend classes at University College, London.<br>
<br>Marshall also published a few original papers in anatomy and embryology. He was a keen microscopist who appreciated continental developments in cellular pathology and germ theory. An advocate of the public health movement, Marshall and Henry Whitehead produced in 1854 a report on the Broad Street pump (more famously associated with the work of John Snow). He examined the water microscopically, and he and Whitehead reached similar conclusions to Snow about the role of contaminated water in the spread of cholera. Marshall designed a circular hospital ward, believing that their shape would improve ventilation, cleanliness, and light, as well as improve nurse efficiency. He attended the openings of several circular wards in British hospitals and visited one in Antwerp that had been designed and built independently of Marshall's well-publicized advocacy.<br>
<br>In these and many other ways, Marshall espoused the liberal, progressive values of a scientifically based medical profession. He was an excellent committeeman, serving on the councils of the Royal Society and the Royal College of Surgeons, whose president he became in 1883. He was also an experienced examiner, both for the University of London and the Royal College of Surgeons. He sat for many years on the General Medical Council and was its president at the time of his death. He played an important role in the introduction of the &#145;Conjoint exam&#146; in 1886, administered jointly by the royal colleges of physicians and surgeons, and aimed at giving general practitioners broadly based medical and surgical qualifications (LRCP and MRCS).<br>
<br>Marshall was nominally an Anglican, but religion was not especially important to either him or his wife. He suffered increasingly from winter bronchitis, and died at his home, Belle Vue House, 92 Cheyne Walk, probably from bronchopneumonia, on new year's day 1891. He was buried in the public cemetery in Ely on 6 January 1891.<br>
