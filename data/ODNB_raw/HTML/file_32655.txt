<span class="headword">Cruttwell,  Charles Robert Mowbray Fraser</span>  (1887&#150;1941), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 23 May 1887 at Denton, near Harleston, Norfolk, the eldest of the three sons of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32656/', "Revd Canon Charles Thomas Cruttwell (1847&#150;1911)")</script>, historian of Roman literature, and his wife, Annie Maud (<i>d</i>. 1926), elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19456/', "Sir John Robert Mowbray (1815&#150;1899), first baronet")</script> and MP. He was educated at Rugby School, where he won an open scholarship to read classics and history at Queen's College, Oxford, in 1906. After gaining firsts in classical moderations (1908), <i>literae humaniores</i> (1910), and modern history (1911), he was elected to a fellowship at All Souls College in 1911, and while in residence there was in 1912 appointed lecturer in modern history at Hertford College. He served valiantly from August 1914 as a second lieutenant in the Royal Berkshire regiment, fighting in France and Belgium during 1915 and 1916 until invalided home, an experience that deeply influenced his later academic work and also permanently damaged his health.<br>
<br>In 1918&#150;19 Cruttwell worked in the military intelligence department of the War Office; he was then, in 1919, elected to an official fellowship in modern history at Hertford College, where he was also dean from 1920 to 1925. He was no less active in university business&#151;serving among other offices as a statutory commissioner (1923), lecturer (1926&#150;30), delegate of the university press, and member of the hebdomadal council. His administrative ability was characterized by a penetrating intelligence, wide-ranging knowledge, firm grasp of detail, decisive judgement, and a good memory. These talents were recognized when, in 1930, he was elected principal of Hertford. As such he supported moves to establish an honour school of geography in Oxford, and was instrumental in securing his college's association with that chair upon its foundation in 1932, when Professor Kenneth Mason was appointed as the first incumbent. Cruttwell's only conspicuous failure in public life came on the occasion of the 1935 general election, when as Conservative candidate for one of the parliamentary seats at Oxford University he was defeated by A. P. Herbert (independent).<br>
<br>Although Cruttwell devoted much of his time to university administration and to his writing, his strongest interest lay in his college, not least in the life of its chapel. While much of the evidence of his way of dealing with others is anecdotal and contradictory, most surviving records testify to his forceful, forthright, and eccentric character, to his interest in the junior members, and to his genuine concern for their welfare. To many who became his close friends Crutters (as he was widely known) was unstintingly hospitable and generous, both in Oxford and at his country house, Vinnicks, at Highclere, near Newbury, Berkshire, and he was remembered with great affection. To others, however, who did not appreciate that his gruff manner disguised a natural shyness, he appeared a rude, harsh-tempered, and unsympathetic man, given to coarse language and cutting personal remarks; but the charge of misogyny so often levelled against him was vehemently denied by those who came to know him well. If a good deal of attention has since focused on his personal rupture with Evelyn Waugh, a scholar in history at Hertford (1922&#150;4), its real significance has no doubt been exaggerated. That their mutual animosity formed early seems clear from reports of Waugh's scurrilous student pranks and from his own writings, yet it is questionable whether his use of the other's name for a variety of unsavoury fictional characters in many of his later works is sufficient evidence of a lasting and bitter feud, on Cruttwell's part at any rate.<br>
<br>Cruttwell's academic reputation rests primarily on his <span class="italic">History of the Great War, 1914&#150;1918</span> (1934; 2nd edn, 1936), a monumental work of painstaking composition, conceived in minute detail and on a truly global scale, widely acclaimed at the time and still well regarded. Written in a precise, even clinical style, it displayed a shrewd understanding of the strategic issues and a mastery of the sources then available. It remains perhaps most notable for its frank and fearless judgements on those identified as the &#145;principal actors&#146; (military, naval, and political) in that tragic conflict, and in 1936 it earned Cruttwell the award of the degree of DLitt from Oxford University. A digest of its leading arguments and conclusions appeared in <span class="italic">The Role of British Strategy in the Great War</span>, the Lees-Knowles lectures he delivered in Cambridge in 1936. In the same year he published a short biography of Wellington, in which the strengths and weaknesses of the commander are nicely balanced. Among his many other writings, he is remembered for two textbooks on modern British and European history (1928, 1929), both models of clarity and cogency, and for <span class="italic">A History of Peaceful Change in the Modern World</span> (1937). He was also widely regarded as an authority on the political history of the Rhineland.<br>
<br>Cruttwell enjoyed country pursuits, and served as a Hampshire JP. In his youth he had been a man of strong although rather clumsy physique, but a serious leg wound and other painful complications of wartime service left lasting scars, and in later years he was prone to rheumatic fever. He was forced to resign his principalship through ill health in 1939, and after further prolonged distress he died in a nursing home, the Burden Institute, Stapleton, near Bristol, on 14 March 1941. He was unmarried. In his will he left his historical books and &pound;1000 to Hertford College, which also holds a good portrait by his cousin, Grace Cruttwell.<br>
