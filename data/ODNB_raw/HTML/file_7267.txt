<span class="headword">Davies,  Thomas</span>  (1792&#150;1839), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in Carmarthenshire, and, after some schooling in London, was apprenticed to his maternal uncle, Mr Price, then apothecary to the London Hospital. He became an apothecary, and practised in the East End of London, but after two years had symptoms of phthisis. He went to Montpellier for his health, and afterwards to Paris, where he learned the then new art of auscultation under R. H. T. La&euml;nnec, at the Necker Hospital. This led to him being known later as &#145;the man with the horn&#146; among his patients in London. Davies graduated MD at Paris on 8 December 1821. After returning to London he was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, on 30 September 1824, and began practice at 30 New Broad Street, London, as a physician. In 1825 he was elected physician to the Infirmary for Asthma (later the Royal Hospital for Diseases of the Chest). Davies lectured at his house on diseases of the lungs and heart, and explained all he had learned from La&euml;nnec. The lectures brought him professional recognition, and he was elected the first assistant physician to the London Hospital on 5 December 1827. He became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 4 July 1838.<br>
<br>Davies's next post was as a lecturer on the practice of physic at the London Hospital. He published a course of lectures on the diseases of the chest in the <span class="italic">London Medical Gazette</span>; these appeared as a book entitled <span class="italic">Lectures on the Diseases of the Lungs and Heart</span> (1835). The book shows that its author had understood and tested for himself all the observations of La&euml;nnec and of James Hope, but he added nothing to what they had taught, and though he writes at length on pericarditis, and had examined many examples <i>post mortem</i>, he was unaware of the existence of a pericardial friction-sound in such cases. Davies also gives an account and description of the exploring needle, which he introduced as a means of diagnosis in certain thoracic conditions.<br>
<br>Davies was married and had several children, one of whom was the physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7238/', "Herbert Davies (1818&#150;1885)")</script>. His chest disease returned, and it caused his death, at New Broad Street on 30 May 1839. Davies was fond of telling his patients, &#145;Keep up your spirits&#146;, and needed to take his own advice during his last illness, when he suffered from depression. He was buried in the churchyard of St Botolph without Bishopsgate, London.<br>
