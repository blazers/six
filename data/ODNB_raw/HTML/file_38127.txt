<span class="headword">Willans,  Peter William</span>  (1851&#150;1892), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was born on 8 November 1851 in Roundhay, Leeds, the second of three sons and third of five children of Obadiah Willans, woollen manufacturer, of Leeds, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Tetley, farmer, of Topcliffe, Yorkshire. His early childhood was spent in Leeds; after a period at a dame-school he went to Leeds grammar school at the age of ten, leaving in 1867 to become an apprentice with the engineering firm of Carrett and Marshall of Hunslet, Leeds.<br>
<br>Willans then moved to London in 1872, joining John Penn &amp; Sons, a leading marine-engine builder, as a draughtsman. While at Penns he designed a high-speed steam engine which had all its working parts totally enclosed and splash-lubricated, a radical departure from contemporary practice. As Penns was not prepared to develop Willans's engines, he first formed a partnership to license other manufacturers, and then in 1876 joined Hunter and English of Bow, London, to develop and market the engine for marine use. However, boat builders were reluctant to install such novel machinery.<br>
<br>Willans married Edith Ellen (<i>b</i>. 1854/5), daughter of Kyrle Money, a minister, on 11 December 1880; they had at least three children. Willans left Hunter and English and in 1880 went into partnership with Mark Robinson and founded the Ferry Works, Thames Ditton, Surrey, to build both engines and boats. The rise of the electricity industry created a new market for his engines, which proved so well suited to driving dynamos that by the time of his death over half the country's electrical power was generated by them. During this time Willans improved his designs and adopted advanced manufacturing techniques, pioneering the rapid assembly of engines from standardized, interchangeable components. He also conducted extensive tests on his engines, which demonstrated their high efficiency and gained him a reputation as a highly scientific engineer.<br>
<br>Willans was a heavily built man with a satirical sense of humour, whose chief recreations were skating and fishing. Although staunchly against trade unionists after a strike in 1889, he introduced profit-sharing schemes for his workforce.<br>
<br>Willans was awarded the Institution of Civil Engineers' Telford medal in 1885, and was elected a member in 1886. In 1888 he was also awarded their Watt medal for his paper &#145;Economy trials of a non-condensing steam engine&#146;. He died on 23 May 1892 at his home, The Wilderness, Frimley Lock, Pirbright, Surrey, after being thrown from his dog-cart while driving to Brookwood Station. He was survived by his wife.<br>
