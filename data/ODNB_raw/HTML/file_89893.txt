<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jones,  Aubrey</span>  (1911&#150;2003), <span class="occ">politician and industrialist</span>, was born on 20 November 1911 at 6 Plantation Terrace, Penydarren, Merthyr Tudful, Glamorgan, the son of Evan Jones, coalminer, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Aubrey, schoolteacher. His father, who began life as a coalface worker before becoming a pit deputy in charge of safety, was an ardent trade unionist in the colliery deputies' union, NACODS, but later contracted the miners' disease of pneumoconiosis, after which he took a labourer's job in the Dowlais steel works.<br>
<br>Jones was educated at Cyfarthfa Castle secondary school in Merthyr and the London School of Economics, where he was tutored by Harold Laski, among others. He won first-class honours and the Gladstone memorial prize as well as the Gerstenberg postgraduate award. It appeared to be a golden key into the Labour movement&#151;but not for Jones. One theory is that in a perverse manner&#151;a notable Jones characteristic&#151;he may have been put off by the left-wing dominance at the London School of Economics in the mid-1930s, when it was almost an imperative to be with the left. Jones's choice was different&#151;he seized an opportunity to start work with the League of Nations in Geneva as a research assistant and then, after a brief spell in the atmosphere of international diplomacy, opted to move into journalism. He applied to <span class="italic">The Times</span> for a job as a foreign correspondent, but received a predictable response: the editor told him first to acquire experience working on a provincial paper and then apply again. Jones accepted that advice and found a job as a reporter on the <span class="italic">Western Mail</span> in Cardiff at &pound;2 a week plus a bonus of five shillings for every leading article he wrote. In 1937 he finally joined <span class="italic">The Times</span> in London as a sub-editor on the foreign desk, where one of his colleagues was Kim Philby&#151;whom Jones later described as &#145;agreeable, analytical, cool, objective and pleasant&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>). Subsequently he was posted to the paper's Paris bureau; after a brief spell in Rome he moved on to Berlin, where he remained a <span class="italic">Times</span> correspondent until three days before the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939.<br>
<br>With his experience in Nazi Germany and Mussolini's Italy, Jones joined the War Office military intelligence unit in 1939, going on to serve in that capacity with the Eighth Army in north Africa and Sicily. He remained with the army until 1946, and it was during the closing days of the war that his political attitude took a decisive shift towards the Conservative Party&#151;again a contrary move since servicemen of all ranks were then mostly voting Labour. While in Sicily he wrote a widely read pamphlet, <span class="italic">Right and Left</span>, which he followed with a full-length book, <span class="italic">The Pendulum of Politics</span> (1946). During the election of 1945, by now with the rank of captain, he was given leave to contest South-East Essex as the tory candidate. Defeated though not discouraged, one year later while still in uniform he was again a candidate and came close to overturning a Labour majority in a by-election at Heywood and Radcliffe, losing by a mere 452 votes. After demobilization he rejoined <span class="italic">The Times</span> but in 1949 moved to the British Iron and Steel Federation as assistant to its director, Sir Andrew Duncan, and played a leading role in the federation's campaign to stop steel nationalization. Meanwhile, on 7 September 1948 he had married Joan Marie Godfrey-Isaacs, daughter of Godfrey Phineas Godfrey-Isaacs, a company director, of Hanger Hill, west London. They had two sons.<br>
<br>In the general election of 1950 Jones won the newly created seat of Birmingham Hall Green for the Conservatives with a majority of 3853. Much to his dismay this did not lead to speedy promotion when the tories returned to office in 1951. The Churchill government passed over Jones and confined him, restlessly, to the back benches from where he continued to work with the British Iron and Steel Federation as well as in parliament. In 1952 he was given a minor role as parliamentary private secretary to the minister of state for economic affairs, Sir Arthur Salter&#151;yet the restlessness continued, even to the point of him privately criticizing his government's policies, notably their lack of effective economic planning. Six months after Eden won the 1955 election Jones finally secured serious promotion, succeeding Geoffrey Lloyd as minister of fuel and power, albeit outside the cabinet. None the less Jones became responsible for three major state-run industries&#151;coal, electricity, and gas. He was sworn of the privy council the same year. His administrative ability was palpable and in 1957 when Harold Macmillan became prime minister Jones was made minister of supply&#151;in charge of defence contracting, including Britain's H-bomb testing programme, as well as the aircraft industry, though still outside the cabinet. He remained in that role until 1959. The final disappointment, which influenced the rest of his career, came after Macmillan won a large majority in the 1959 election: Macmillan abolished the Ministry of Supply and made Duncan Sandys his minister of aviation. Jones, disapproving strongly of the abolition of his ministry, and offered only a minor post, returned to the back benches. Increasingly he voiced criticism of his own government, especially over its policy on Europe. It was already clear that he was shifting towards a more liberal social and economic agenda and was out of tune with mainstream Conservative thinking. He was particularly out of sympathy with his government's policy on race relations and immigration and in November 1962 he rebelliously called for Macmillan's resignation. Yet even when that happened a year later, with Sir Alec Douglas-Home becoming prime minister, there was no ministerial job for him.<br>
<br>In 1965 Jones accepted the Wilson government's invitation to become the first chairman of the National Board for Prices and Incomes. He resigned his seat to begin a new career which he later described as being his most fulfilling period in public affairs, though he was to find just as many frustrations in his new role as in parliament. Britain's economic situation was in continuous crisis, with the industrial relations scene tense and unpredictable. By then Jones was a convinced advocate of a rational wages policy as part of a planned economic strategy. But with the collapse of George Brown's national economic plan and devalution in 1967, Jones found himself trapped by circumstances beyond his influence or control. Though lacking powers of compulsion, the board found itself increasingly criticized by trade unions, and engaged in turf wars with the Monopolies Commission. On the eve of the 1970 election the Wilson government announced its intention of ending the latter by merging the Monopolies Commission with the Prices and Incomes Board, under Jones's command. However, the election was won by Heath's Conservatives, and Jones's organization was scrapped the following year.<br>
<br>Jones retired to a range of industrial directorships (including Thomas Tilling Ltd and the Cornhill Insurance Co. Ltd), academic lecturing, writing several books (notably <span class="italic">The New Inflation: the Politics of Prices and Incomes</span>, 1973, <span class="italic">Oil: the Missed Opportunity</span>, 1981, and <span class="italic">Britain's Economy: the Roots of Stagnation</span>, 1985, the latter in part autobiographical), and lamenting the failure of successive governments to recognize the importance of a prices and incomes policy within a new economic strategy. He joined the Liberal Party in 1980 and in 1983 stood as the Alliance candidate against a tory minister, Norman Fowler, at Sutton Coldfield, where he was soundly defeated. He died on 10 April 2003 at Westhampnett Nursing Home, Chichester, of motor neurone disease. He was survived by his wife, Joan, and their two sons.<br>
<br>Aubrey Jones was very much an odd one out&#151;in youth a loner, who despite his successful career remained a somewhat uneasy and detached character for the rest of his life. A meticulous, measured, and polished executant of power, he yet seemed uncomfortable with it, as if always affected by an inner conflict. From the coalfields of south Wales to the centre of Conservative political power was a remarkable journey, taken by very few. Yet in truth it was a journey too far for Jones, who only later in life discovered his m&eacute;tier, as a radical economic reformer. He was more comfortable as a technocrat than as a politician, and more suited to that role.<br>
