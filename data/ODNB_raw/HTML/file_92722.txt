<span class="headword">Stewart <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Glubb; <em>other married names </em>Janson; Hawkes]</span>,  Gwenda Mary</span>  (1894&#150;1990), <span class="occ">racing driver</span>, was born at Burnaby Villas, Fulwood, Preston, Lancashire, on 1 June 1894, the daughter of Frederic Manley Glubb (1857&#150;1938), captain and later major-general in the Royal Engineers, who was created KCMG in 1918, and his wife, Frances Letitia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bagot (1861/2&#150;1959). She combined Cornish and Irish descent. The army officer and Arabist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40128/', "Sir John Bagot Glubb [Glubb Pasha]")</script> was her younger brother. In January 1913 she became a student at St Hilda's Hall, Cheltenham, a residential college attached to Cheltenham Ladies' College, where she took a course in librarianship.<br>
<br>In April 1915 Gwenda Glubb left Cheltenham to undertake war work in the intelligence department of the War Office. She then joined the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service unit as a volunteer. Driving motor ambulances in the Serbian division of the Russian army, she served in the Balkans where she took part in the Russian retreat from the Dobruja, Romania, early in 1917. She was later decorated for her bravery, receiving the Cross of St George and Cross of St Stanislaus. After returning to Britain she taught motor driving in Hyde Park for the Women's Legion and at Hurst Park, East Molesey, a training base for the Women's Royal Air Force (WRAF).<br>
<br>At Hurst Park, Glubb met Lieutenant-Colonel Sam Janson (1887&#150;1943), deputy-inspector of transport in the RAF. Allegations of immorality at Hurst Park were made by the WRAF commandant Violet Douglas-Pennant, who was subsequently dismissed. In July 1919, moving for an inquiry into Douglas-Pennant's dismissal, Lord Stanhope alleged in a speech in the House of Lords that Janson and a female officer had been found together in the same bedroom in the early hours of the morning. Both Glubb and Janson, who were legally represented, appeared in person to give evidence before a select committee of the House of Lords. The hearings took place in October 1919 and were widely reported in the press. The committee received medical testimony confirming Glubb's virginity, Stanhope withdrew the statement he had made about Janson and Glubb, and the committee's report in November 1919 refuted the accusations.<br>
<br>In December 1919 Glubb's engagement to Janson was announced. He was the son of George Janson, merchant, and they married on 17 February 1920. Her personal life was bound up with her motoring career. In the early 1920s, as Gwenda Janson, she began racing. She preferred attempts to make absolute records rather than the more contrived &#145;women's records&#146;. In November 1921 she raced a Ner-A-Car motorcycle in a thousand miles trial under the supervision of the Auto Cycle Union. In July 1922 she rode a 249 cc Trump-JAP at Brooklands to break double-twelve, effectively a twenty-four hour speed record for motor cycles (undertaken in two twelve-hour periods, as overnight racing was not permitted at the Surrey circuit) and did so at the same time as Selwyn Edge was beating his 1907 double-twelve feat in a car. Sustained, it was said, mainly by tea and cigarettes, she achieved an average speed of 44.65 m.p.h. over the twenty-four hours. She also co-rode a Rudge 350 cc motorcycle at Montlh&eacute;ry, France, to set a twenty-four hour record, each rider alternating for two-hour stints at an average of 54.21 m.p.h.<br>
<br>Gwenda Janson began a relationship with her co-rider Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Neil Stewart in the autumn of 1922, and Colonel Janson divorced her in 1923. On 25 April 1924 she married Stewart. A retired army officer, he was involved in the company which made the motorcycles which she rode, and was the son of John Charles Stewart, of independent means. The Stewarts settled in France and collaborated with the engineer (Wallace) Douglas Hawkes (1893&#150;1974), who ran the Derby car company near Paris, and who prepared her cars.<br>
<br>As Gwenda Stewart she continued to make record attempts at Montlh&eacute;ry, many of them in the presence only of official observers and time keepers rather than in front of crowds. She later remarked that the autodrome at Montlh&eacute;ry was a home from home for her. In 1929 she set a series of records there in a Morgan three-wheeler, achieving 101.5 m.p.h. With S. C. H. Davis as co-driver, in 1930 she set further Morgan records, including an average of 72.72 m.p.h. over twelve hours.<br>
<br>In 1930 Douglas Hawkes acquired the Derby-Miller car which he adapted for Stewart's subsequent record attempts. At the Arpajon speed trials she reached 140 m.p.h. followed in early 1931 by a world 10 mile record of 137.20 m.p.h. That year she was elected to honorary membership of the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC) and at the Paris Motor Show was awarded the Montlh&eacute;ry challenge trophy for her record attempts at the autodrome. In poor health during 1932, she returned to the track in 1933, achieving a lap time at Montlh&eacute;ry of 140 m.p.h. in the Derby-Miller. She raised this to 147.79 m.p.h. in a Derby Special in a drive which ended with her front two wheels torn off, and her suffering from mild concussion. She took part in the Le Mans 24 hour race in 1934 and 1935, in a Derby, but failed to finish on either occasion.<br>
<br>Encouraged by the Brooklands promoters, who welcolmed the publicity, a contest between Gwenda Stewart and Kay Petre was arranged for the August bank holiday meeting in 1935. In a preliminary contest, on 3 August, Stewart, driving an eight cylinder super-charged Derby-Miller, broke the 130 m.p.h. barrier, and Kay Petre's existing lap record of 129.59 m.p.h., with a lap of 130.17 m.p.h. Petre regained her record that evening, with a lap of 134.75 m.p.h., which Stewart, though reaching 133.67 m.p.h., could not better in the main event on 5 August. On the following day, with few spectators present, Stewart regained the ladies' lap record at 135.95 m.p.h., which was also an official Brooklands record for class E cars (up to 2000 cc). Both women earned prestigious Brooklands 130 m.p.h. badges: two of a total of seventeen issued before 1939. In September 1936 she took part in the BRDC 500 mile race at Brooklands in a single-seater Dusenberg, sharing the drive with its owner, Jack Duller, and finishing seventh. In 1936 she received an award from the French government in acknowledgement of her racing performances.<br>
<br>In 1937 she married Douglas Hawkes and returned to Britain, where together they ran the Brooklands Engineering Company at the racing circuit. She worked a lathe, as well as overseeing the men, and also served in the London Auxiliary Ambulance Service during the war, when the company shifted to munitions production. She had always preferred a nomadic life, and after the war she and Douglas Hawkes went to sea in their yacht <i>Elpis</i> to enjoy complete privacy. They eventually settled on the Greek island of Poros. After her husband's death Gwenda Hawkes moved to mainland Greece, where she died at Amarousion, Athens, on 27 May 1990. Her funeral was held the next day in Athens, later followed by a service of thanksgiving at St Dunstan's, Mayfield, Sussex. Remarkable for her speed and endurance ability on two, three, and four wheels, she was regarded by S. C. H. Davis, who co-drove with her and supported many twenty-four hour attempts, as the greatest woman driver of her time.<br>
