<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tynan,  Kenneth Peacock</span>  (1927&#150;1980), <span class="occ">theatre critic</span>, was born on 2 April 1927 at the Glenhurst Nursing Home, 319 Shaftmoor Lane, Hall Green, Birmingham, the only son of Sir Peter Peacock (1872&#150;1948), merchant and former mayor of Warrington, and (Letitia) Rose Tynan (1888&#150;1961). The couple had lived as husband and wife in Birmingham, where Sir Peter was known as Mr Tynan, since 1921. He continued to maintain in some style the wife and family he had left behind in Warrington. Tynan was not told of any of this until his father's death, when he was much upset, not so much by the secret itself as that it had been kept from him. At King Edward's School, Birmingham, he had begun to acquire the enthusiasms that would shape his life. He loved music-hall, theatre, and the cinema, and could not rest until he had set down his account of any film or play or, in particular, any performance that impressed him. He acted in and directed school productions, and lured the eminent critic James Agate to come and see the result. In his last year he won a demyship at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he embarked upon a systematic campaign to outshine or outrage all contemporaries as undergraduate journalist, actor, impresario, party-giver, and (despite a stammer) debater. If Oxford had turned him into a show-off, he said later, at least it had turned him into a professional show-off. At the same time he was amassing enough serious and enthusiastic consideration of the theatre to provide him with his first book, <span class="italic">He that Plays the King</span> (1950), and a wider reputation.<br>
<br>After a spell as a repertory theatre director Tynan seized the chance to become a professional theatre critic. Invited by Alec Guinness to take the part of the Player King in Guinness's luckless production of <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> for the Festival of Britain, Tynan became the target of especially scornful remarks from the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>'s reviewer, A. Beverley Baxter. He replied with a letter to the editor so droll that according to legend he was immediately hired in Baxter's place. In fact some weeks elapsed, and he had in any case been chipping in notices to <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, but no doubt his flair for attracting attention played its part. With the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> (1952&#150;3) and to a lesser extent with the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span> (1953&#150;4) Tynan established himself as a funny and scathing writer on the theatre, if still one who wanted from it heroics, illusions, and sad stories of the death of kings. It was only after he was invited to join <span class="italic">The Observer</span> in 1954 that he started to apply to drama the political convictions which he was in the process of acquiring, with characteristic intemperance, about this time. &#145;I doubt that I could love anyone who did not wish to see it&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Observer</span>, 13 May 1956), he affirmed in a review of John Osborne's <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span>, inspired as much by the play's tirades against respectability and authority as by its theatrical virtues. He went on to embrace socialism, nuclear disarmament, and the didactic drama of Bertolt Brecht.<br>
<br>His new-found beliefs did not prevent Tynan from remaining a socializer as well as a socialist. He had married on 25 January 1951 Elaine Rita Brimberg, the writer <a href="#cosubject_99858">Elaine Dundy [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Their Mayfair flat became a salon for celebrities passing through London, particularly from the United States. Tynan was fascinated by the outsize stars of Hollywood and Broadway. It was inevitable that he would be lured to America himself, as theatre critic of the <span class="italic">New Yorker</span>, though without severing his <span class="italic">Observer</span> connection. In the end he stayed only two years before returning to London in 1960.<br>
<br>Tynan was never sure that he wanted to remain a writer, much less a critic. He leapt at every chance to work in a production capacity as well. He was script editor for Ealing Films in its last years (1955&#150;7); produced two programmes for Associated Television on the Stanislavskian method (1958) and dissent in America (1960); and edited the arts magazine <span class="italic">Tempo</span> for ABC Television (England) (1961&#150;2). In 1963 he seized the opportunity to abandon his critic's seat altogether. The National Theatre was finally being set up with Sir Laurence Olivier as its first director. Tynan wrote to him proposing that he should be its dramaturg, or literary manager. Olivier agreed. Tynan threw himself into the task with energy and confidence. He disinterred forgotten classics, edited texts, and directly inspired such new works as Tom Stoppard's <span class="italic">Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead</span> and Peter Shaffer's <span class="italic">Black Comedy</span>. These first seasons are generally regarded as having given the National's repertoire its stamp, but among the hits were one or two misfires, including a Brecht, which Tynan's critics could cite when in 1968 he clashed with the governors of the theatre over his determination to introduce <span class="italic">Soldiers</span>, by the German playwright Rolf Hochhuth. The play alleged <i>inter alia</i> that Sir Winston Churchill had ordered the death of the wartime Polish leader General Sikorski. As a former colleague of Churchill's, the National's chairman, Viscount Chandos, was adamant that the production should not go ahead. Tynan responded by mounting the play himself in the commercial theatre. This did not endear him to the board, but his eventual departure in 1973 was chiefly prompted by Olivier's retirement that year and the choice of Peter Hall, whom Tynan loathed, as his successor.<br>
<br>Meanwhile came the exploit which prompted mixed feelings among Tynan's friends and admirers, the revue <span class="italic">Oh! Calcutta!</span> which he devised and produced first in New York, in 1969, and then in London. He had embraced the sexual &#145;liberation&#146; of the era with the same enthusiasm as he brought to its political concomitant, listing his recreations in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> as sex and eating and in 1965 earning himself a footnote in the annals as the first Briton to say the word &#145;fuck&#146; on television. <span class="italic">Oh! Calcutta!</span>'s mix of nudity and seedy humour might have been designed to shock the bourgeoisie; ironically (if inevitably) it was a success everywhere, and although Tynan complained that his royalty was only 1 per cent of the gross takings, this was enough to support, for a few years at least, an increasingly lavish lifestyle.<br>
<br>After some blissful years and the birth of a daughter, Tracy, Tynan's first marriage had run into trouble when he began to demand Dundy's submission to what he called &#145;spanking&#146;. Though initially encouraging of her literary efforts, he also became acutely envious of her success. They finally divorced in 1964. Tynan married secondly, on 30 June 1967, Kathleen Jeanette Gates (1937&#150;1995), daughter of Matthew Halton, writer and formerly a war correspondent for the BBC and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. She was herself a journalist and writer. They had a daughter, Roxana, and a son, Matthew. They acquired a London house in Kensington, and somewhat late in life Tynan learned to drive and bought himself a Jaguar. Understandably, the second Mrs Tynan proved no keener than the first to share in sado-masochistic practices which only the publication of his diaries in 2001 made fully plain. Tynan took a mistress who did, and to whom he was eventually more faithful than to either wife. The marriage nevertheless jogged on, not without spells of happiness.<br>
<br>Tynan ventured into film production with the 1971 version of <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> directed by Roman Polanski and collaborated on a follow-up to <span class="italic">Oh! Calcutta!</span> called <span class="italic">Carte blanche</span>. But the last decade of his life was increasingly one of restless travels, unfulfilled projects, and bouts of activity alternating with periods of idleness or illness. Emphysema, first diagnosed in 1965, was steadily destroying his lungs. He now regretted the way his career had turned out and wished that he had stuck to working in the theatre or films instead of following the lonely trade of the writer. Yet it was journalism&#151;prompted, often, by the need to raise a quick advance&#151;that gave him a last solid achievement. Mainly for American magazines, he wrote a series of lengthy reflective profiles of actors and entertainers which, published in book form as <span class="italic">Show People</span> (1979), confirm Tynan's forte as a writer&#151;his ability to conjure up time and place, people and performances, whether he is defining the extraordinary allure of Louise Brooks or conveying exactly what it was like to experience Donald Wolfit and Frederick Valk (two of his heroes) in a barnstorming wartime production of <span class="italic">Othello</span>.<br>
<br>Tynan had published two collections of theatre reviews but disappointingly few original books, despite becoming a youthful FRSL in 1956. A long-planned memoir of his Oxford days materialized only in the form of his contribution to the television series <span class="italic">One Pair of Eyes</span> in 1968. Towards the end he was researching an autobiography, but it was not to be realized. To lessen the ravages of his illness he was now living in California. He died there at St John's Hospital, Los Angeles, on 26 July 1980 from emphysema. His remains were cremated at Rosedale, Culver City, California, on 30 July and his ashes were interred at the St Cross cemetery, Oxford, England, on 17 September that year.<br>
<br>Tynan was tall, slender, always elegant. In youth his habit of baring his teeth as he strove to overcome the stammer, coupled with flaring nostrils and a rather skull-like head, gave him the look of a startled rocking-horse. He matured into a relaxed and attractive human being, full of unexpected subsidiary enthusiasms (cricket, word games, bull-fighting). His conversation, as Tom Stoppard put it, always had the jingle of loose change about it. When he died it seemed that for all his aberrations he had inspired considerable affection in those who knew him. Whether or not he left any permanent mark on the theatre can never be finally settled&#151;fashions come and go; some of those he promoted, such as Brechtian drama, were already out of favour by the time he died, doubtless due to rise again one day. All that may be said with confidence is that Tynan brought excitement, authority, and glamour to the business of writing about the theatre.<br>
<br>Tynan's first wife, <a name="cosubject_99858"></a><span class="headword">Elaine Dundy</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Elaine Rita Brimberg]</span>  (1921&#150;2008), <span class="occ">novelist and biographer</span>, was born on 2 August 1921 in Manhattan, one of three daughters of Samuel M. Brimberg, a Jewish garment manufacturer who later turned to the manufacture of office equipment. Her father was violent and it was an unhappy childhood. She was educated at Mills College in Oakland, California, Sweet Briar College in Virginia, and then, after wartime service in the Army Signals Corps based in Arlington, Virginia, at the Jarvis Theatre School, Washington, DC, where she adopted the stage (and eventually pen) name, Elaine Dundy. Moving to Europe, she spent a year in Paris before arriving in London, scraping a living in both cities by taking small parts in plays. She married Tynan three months after meeting him, attracted by his romantic and larger-than-life character, and did her best to cope with his mercurial temperament. She originally wrote <span class="italic">The Dud Avocado</span> (1958), a comic novel about a young American woman in Paris, subtitled &#145;The Vie Amoureuse of Sally Jay in Paris&#146;, because she thought it would please him, but the overnight success of the book instead filled him with envy. Eventually his violent temper and infidelities became unbearable; she started drinking heavily, and finally left him after suffering a broken nose and two black eyes. From 1964 to the 1980s she divided her time between New York and London (where she kept a house in Mayfair). She wrote two more novels, <span class="italic">The Old Man and Me</span> (1964) and <span class="italic">The Injured Party</span> (1974), but neither enjoyed the success of <span class="italic">The Dud Avocado</span>. She also, after a period of rehabilitation for drink and drug addictions, wrote a biography of the actor Peter Finch, also well known for his hell-raising (1980); <span class="italic">Elvis and Gladys</span> (1985), about Elvis Presley's relationship with his mother; <span class="italic">Ferriday, Louisiana</span> (1991), a study of a small town in America which claimed to have produced more famous people per square mile than anywhere else in America; and an autobiography, <span class="italic">Life Itself!</span> (2001), which several critics slated for its relentless name-dropping. She had meanwhile moved to Los Angeles in the 1980s, and died there on 1 May 2008 following a heart attack. She was survived by her daughter, Tracy, a costume designer and film director.<br>
