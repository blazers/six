<span class="headword">Hope, Sir  James Archibald</span>  (1785&#150;1871), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the son of Lieutenant-Colonel Erskine Hope, 26th (Cameronians) regiment, and great-grandson of Sir Thomas Hope of Craighall, Fife, eighth baronet. In January 1800 he was appointed ensign in the 26th (Cameronians), then at Halifax, Nova Scotia, of which his father was junior major. He became lieutenant in the regiment in 1801 and captain in 1805. He served with his regiment in Hanover in 1805&#150;6, was a deputy assistant adjutant-general under Lord Cathcart at Copenhagen in 1807, and was on the staff of Sir John Hope, later fourth earl of Hopetoun, in Sweden in 1808, in Spain in 1808&#150;9 (including the battle of Corunna), and with the Walcheren expedition. He was aide-de-camp to General Thomas Graham at Barossa, and brought home the dispatches and the &#145;eagle&#146; captured by the 87th regiment. He was afterwards with Graham at Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz.<br>
<br>When Graham went home on sick leave during Wellington's advance against the forts of Salamanca, Hope was appointed an assistant adjutant-general, and he was present at Salamanca, Burgos, Vitoria, San Sebastian, and the passage of the Bidassoa. He was afterwards selected to act as assistant adjutant-general and military secretary to Marshal Beresford, who was in command of an army corps. With this corps Hope saw the later campaigns, including the battle of the Nivelle, Nive, Orthez, and Toulouse. He was made a brevet major in March 1811 and lieutenant-colonel in January 1813, and was promoted on 25 July 1814 from the Cameronians to captain and lieutenant-colonel 3rd foot guards. In that regiment he served twenty-five years, retiring on half pay unattached on 1 November 1839. He became brevet colonel in 1830 and major-general in 1841, and was employed as major-general on the staff in Lower Canada, 1841&#150;7; he was appointed colonel in the 9th regiment in 1848, becoming lieutenant-general in 1851 and general in 1859.<br>
<br>Hope was a GCB, and had the Peninsular gold cross and clasp for Vitoria, Nivelle, Nive, Orthez, and Toulouse. He was married, and had three children. He died at his residence, Balgowan House, Pittville, Cheltenham, on 30 December 1871, aged eighty-six.<br>
