<span class="headword">Ua N&eacute;ill,  Flaithbertach</span> <span class="st"> [Flaithbheartach O'Neill, Flaithbertach an Trost&aacute;in]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1036), <span class="occ">king of Ailech</span>, was a member of the Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain branch of the northern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill, and the son of Muirchertach (<i>d</i>. 977), son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50106/', "Domnall ua N&#233;ill (d. 980)")</script>, high-king of Ireland, and of Cres Cumal, a lady of the U&iacute; Maine of Connacht. He succeeded to the kingship of Ailech following the premature death of his uncle &Aacute;ed in 1004, and in 1005 and 1007 is found raiding in Lecale, Down, and doing battle against the Ulaid. He may have submitted to the high-king, Brian B&oacute;ruma, on the latter's northern campaign of 1005, but refused submission on that of the following year (though at some point he married Brian's daughter, B&eacute; Binn, who bore him his sons &Aacute;ed and Domnall). When he ventured south to Conailli Muirthemne in 1006 he was opposed by the former high-king, M&aacute;el Sechnaill mac Domnaill of the southern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill, and lost 200 men; but he raided successfully as far south as Brega in 1009.<br>
<br>Ua N&eacute;ill continued to build up his northern power base by blinding and killing an Inishowen lord in 1009, and, having in 1010 made a renewed submission at Armagh to Brian B&oacute;ruma (who brought Flaithbertach's hostages home to Kincora), he raided westwards in Cen&eacute;l Conaill in the following year in the company of Brian's son Murchad, and eastwards in Ulaid, where he burnt Duneight. In 1012 he was back in east Ulster plundering Ards, and led two western campaigns against Cen&eacute;l Conaill. M&aacute;el Sechnaill took advantage of his absence on one of these to raid the Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain inauguration site at Telach &Oacute;c, but offered no opposition to Flaithbertach when he campaigned near Kells, Meath, a year later.<br>
<br>In 1015, following the death of Brian B&oacute;ruma, Ua N&eacute;ill assisted M&aacute;el Sechnaill in his campaign to recover the high-kingship, burning Dublin and U&iacute; Chennselaig in the south-east, setting up a new king over Leinster, and plundering neighbouring Osraige. Five years later he helped secure the hostages of Connacht for M&aacute;el Sechnaill; but after the latter's death in 1022 he began to interfere again in the late high-king's sphere of influence. In 1025 he took an army south to Brega and to the area ruled by the Hiberno-Norse of Dublin, taking hostages and effectively securing his dominance over them. Although he was repulsed by a member of M&aacute;el Sechnaill's dynasty, he returned to Meath a year later and seized from the Hiberno-Norse the crann&oacute;g site at Inishmot.<br>
<br>This is the last military engagement at which Flaithbertach Ua N&eacute;ill's presence is recorded, although the army of Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain did raid Ulaid in 1027 and Cen&eacute;l Conaill in 1028. He must have been very elderly at this stage, a full fifty years after the death of his father, and in the following year went &#145;on his pilgrimage&#146; to Armagh, thereby abdicating. In spite of his advanced years, in 1030 he became the latest in a succession of recent Irish lords to visit Rome (as a result of which he acquired his nickname, Flaithbertach an Trost&aacute;in, &#145;Flaithbertach of the Pilgrim's Staff&#146;), returning safely within a year. His son Domnall had died in 1027 and he was succeeded by another son, &Aacute;ed, whom he joined in plundering Inishowen in 1031; but &Aacute;ed too died, in 1033, forcing Flaithbertach out of his retirement, an annalist reporting that &#145;the north of Ireland submitted to him on account of seniority&#146;  (annals of Inisfallen, s.a. 1034). However, he died in 1036 &#145;after a good life and penance&#146;  (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, s.a. 1036). The kingship of Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain and Ailech passed out of his direct line at this point, and no one of the surname Ua N&eacute;ill held it again until it was recovered by Flaithbertach's direct descendant, &Aacute;ed in Mac&aacute;em T&oacute;inlesc, in 1167.<br>
