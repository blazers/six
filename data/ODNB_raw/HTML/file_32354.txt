<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chambers, Sir  Edmund Kerchever</span>  (1866&#150;1954), <span class="occ">theatre historian and civil servant</span>, was born at West Ilsley, Berkshire, on 16 March 1866. He was the son of the Revd William Chambers (<i>b</i>. 1826/7), curate, and fellow of Worcester College, Oxford, and his wife, Anna Heathcote, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/689/', "Thomas Kerchever Arnold (bap. 1800, d. 1853)")</script>, the educational writer and theologian. After receiving his early education at Marlborough College, Chambers proceeded to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, as a classical scholar, took firsts in honour moderations (1887) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1889), and in 1891 won the chancellor's English essay prize with an essay on literary forgeries. He was not awarded a fellowship, but before he left Oxford in 1892 for the education department, he had already acquired a bent for English studies and produced an edition of <span class="italic">Richard II</span> (1891). He went on to become a notable example of a man who followed two careers, both with distinction. On 5 September 1893 he married Eleanor Christabel (Nora) Bowman, the daughter of John Davison Bowman of the Exchequer and Audit Office. They had no children.<br>
<br>Chambers's duties in the education department were not at first onerous, but from 1903 he became a valued lieutenant of Robert Morant, permanent secretary to the newly constituted Board of Education. Chambers's contribution was most important in matters relating to day continuation schools and adult education. The day continuation schools were victims of the economies associated with the name of Sir Eric Geddes, but the Workers' Educational Association and other promoters of adult education were well aware of the debt of gratitude they owed to Chambers. He rose to be second secretary (1921), but perhaps because of his unaccommodating manner with deputations he was not offered the post of permanent secretary, and he resigned in 1926.<br>
<br>During his years as a civil servant Chambers also practised journalism and edited many editions of the English classics, especially Shakespeare. He was the first president of the Malone Society (1906&#150;39) and contributed to its <span class="italic">Collections</span> valuable papers on dramatic records. Among the best of his publications were an anthology, <span class="italic">Early English Lyrics</span> (1907), chosen by him and Frank Sidgwick, and <span class="italic">The Oxford Book of Sixteenth-Century Verse</span> (1932). His interest in Arthurian studies, dating from his undergraduate days, resulted in <span class="italic">Arthur of Britain</span> (1927).<br>
<br>From the time Chambers left Oxford he was working at &#145;a little book about Shakespeare and the conditions, literary and dramatic, under which he wrote&#146;. This &#145;little book&#146; grew into his three chief publications, <span class="italic">The Mediaeval Stage</span> (2 vols., 1903), <span class="italic">The Elizabethan Stage</span> (4 vols., 1923), and <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span> (2 vols., 1930). A master of dramatic history, Chambers made no attempt in these works to evaluate plays as literature. He was convinced that any history of drama which does not confine itself solely to the analysis of genius must start from a study of the social and economic facts on which the drama rested, and these facts he presented with a fullness and accuracy not approached before. In <span class="italic">The Mediaeval Stage</span> the only well-trodden ground was the interlude; on minstrelsy and folk drama, and to some extent on the liturgical and miracle plays, his was pioneer work. <span class="italic">The Elizabethan Stage</span> was more a work of consolidation than of discovery, but even so his originality appeared in the acuteness with which he balanced complicated evidence. His <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span>, completed in his days of leisure, was carefully composed, with due consideration given to all the material facts and problems. All three works showed the same grasp of all relevant evidence and the same lucidity in a prose that achieves a good expository level.<br>
<br>After his <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span> Chambers did not abandon Elizabethan studies (<span class="italic">Sir Thomas Wyatt and some Collected Studies</span>, 1933, and <span class="italic">Shakespearean Gleanings</span>, 1944) but in his biographies of Coleridge (1938) and Matthew Arnold (1947) he turned also to the Romantic poetry of which his own verses are late examples (<span class="italic">Carmina argentea</span>, privately printed, 1918).<br>
<br>Chambers's services to education and his scholarship earned him many honours. He received the honorary DLitt from Durham (1922) and Oxford (1939), and his election to an honorary fellowship at Corpus Christi (1934) gave him great pleasure. He was appointed CB in 1912 and KBE in 1925, and in 1924 was elected FBA. He also became a foreign member of the Royal Society of Letters of Lund (1928), and a corresponding fellow of the Medieval Academy of America (1933).<br>
<br>After his retirement Chambers lived at Eynsham, near Oxford, and there wrote <span class="italic">Sir Henry Lee</span> (1936), a life of the ranger of Woodstock, and <span class="italic">Eynsham under the Monks</span> (1936), his one work on medieval local history. In his <span class="italic">English Literature at the Close of the Middle Ages</span> (1945), a contribution to the <span class="roman">Oxford History of English Literature</span>, he returned to the subjects of medieval drama and lyric, the ballad and folk poetry, and Malory. In 1938 he moved from Eynsham to Bovey Coombe, Beer, Devon, where he died on 21 January 1954.<br>
