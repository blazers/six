<span class="headword">Pont,  Robert</span>  (1524&#150;1606), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and judge</span>, was born, according to George Buchanan, at or near Culross in Fife, a son of John Pont of Shires Mill and Catherine Murray, daughter of the laird of Tullibardine. Shires Mill, whose property his father held, belonged to Culross Abbey as superior, and at the Reformation Robert Pont himself paid to the abbey &pound;4 4<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. in annual dues for a &#145;third of Schyris Myln&#146;  (Kirk, <span class="italic">Books of Assumption</span>, 290).<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Educated in Culross, Pont proceeded to St Andrews University where he matriculated at St Leonard's College in 1544, with John Row, later fellow reformer and minister of Perth. His brother James also entered St Leonard's College in 1551, graduated in 1554, and went on to serve as examiner, bursar, and regent in the university. Pont's pre-Reformation career remains elusive, although he acquired an expertise in law.<br>
<br>By 1559 Pont had settled in St Andrews. That year he signed the declaration of the protestants there to assist the reforming lords of the congregation in &#145;mayntening of the trew religioun of Christe, and downe putting of all superstitioun and idolatrie&#146;  (Fleming, 6&#150;8). He was also prominent as an elder on the kirk session of Holy Trinity Church in St Andrews. As a commissioner from the town, along with the minister, Christopher Goodman, and another elder, he attended the reformers' general assembly which met in Edinburgh in December 1560. This found Pont and twenty other individuals in the area around St Andrews to be qualified to serve as ministers and teachers in the reformed church. In July 1562 his appointment as minister of Dunblane was approved by the general assembly and his brother James was appointed to serve Melrose for a spell before being assigned as minister to Lord Erskine, later earl of Mar, commendator of Dryburgh and Cambuskenneth abbeys and Inchmahome Priory. It was perhaps about this time that Pont married his first wife, whose name is uncertain but who is thought by some sources to have been Katherine, daughter of Adam Masterton of Grange.<br>
<br>Pont was minister of Dunkeld in December 1562 when he was shortlisted for the superintendentship of Dumfries and Galloway, though the post remained unfilled, and another minister was appointed to Dunkeld. From 1563 he acted as the assembly's commissioner for visiting churches and placing ministers in the area of Inverness, Moray, and Banff, though he requested to be released from the burden of overseeing Gaelic-speaking congregations on account of his &#145;laicke of the Irish tongue&#146;  (Thomson, 1.40). Despite his plea in 1568 &#145;to be placed in a particular congregation&#146;  (ibid., 1.129), the assembly encouraged Pont to continue as commissioner of Moray. Only with the election of a protestant bishop of Moray was Pont able to demit office as commissioner in 1574. In those years he seems not to have held a parochial charge. Although he received a presentation to the vicarage of Birnie on 13 January 1568, he did not act as minister there, as a subsequent presentation to James Johnston, minister of Birnie, on 26 February 1568 makes clear.<h2>
<a name="Publicationpromotionandleadershipinthekirk"></a>Publication, promotion, and leadership in the kirk</h2>In 1566 Pont had been selected by the assembly to examine William Ramsay's answer to Heinrich Bullinger's <span class="italic">Judgement declaring it lawfull for ministers of the Church of England to weare the apparell prescribed by the lawes</span> (1566), and he was a signatory to the letter sent by the general assembly to the bishops of England that year, interceding in the vestiarian controversy on behalf of the conscience-stricken in the English church who &#145;refuse the Romish ragges&#146;  (Thomson, 1.85&#150;8). At that point, too, he translated and published, at the behest of the assembly, the second Helvetic confession of faith, omitting the section on the commemoration of certain holy days to which the Scottish church took exception. He later issued a catechism of his own, <span class="italic">Parvus catechismus</span> (1573).<br>
<br>Elected moderator of the general assembly on six occasions&#151;in July 1570, August 1575, April 1581, October 1583, March 1596, April 1597&#151;Pont was prominent in the councils of the church. His legal training doubtless contributed to his selection to a committee of assembly in 1564, and again in 1570, to determine the extent of the church's jurisdiction and to his appointment in 1572 as a senator of the college of justice (or judge on the court of session). The general assembly, which gave grudging acceptance to the arrangement, insisted that the appointment should not be interpreted as precedent for other ministers to follow suit and that Pont should remain a minister.<br>
<br>Pont's nomination by the crown to the provostry of Trinity College in Edinburgh in January 1572 provided him with an annual income of some 200 merks and in November 1573 he gained a pension of 300 merks from the bishopric of Moray. With his resignation as commissioner of Moray in 1574, he was admitted minister of the second charge in St Cuthbert's Church beside Edinburgh and gained a presentation from the crown on 29 December 1578 to the vicarage of St Cuthbert.<br>
<br>Present at the convention of Leith in 1572, which attempted to solve the vexed question of ecclesiastical endowment by introducing a protestant episcopate, Pont also sat on the assembly's committee which produced a critical appraisal of the implications of the Leith settlement. In 1573 he was chosen one of the assembly's representatives for discussions with the government, and in 1575 to confer with the regent, Morton, on the church's jurisdiction and polity. He took an active part in preparing the <span class="italic">Second Book of Discipline</span> (1578), was present at the conference, summoned by the king, at Stirling Castle on the contents of the <span class="italic">Second Book of Discipline</span>, and was selected by the assembly in 1580 to help devise a scheme for establishing presbyteries.<h2>
<a name="Kirkandcrown"></a>Kirk and crown</h2>In 1578, with James Lawson and David Lindsay, Pont accompanied the English ambassador to Stirling in an effort to achieve reconciliation among the political factions following Regent Morton's downfall, engineered by the earls of Atholl and Argyll. Efforts by the town of St Andrews to secure Pont as their minister in 1581, and again in 1582, ended in failure. At the assembly's behest, he took part in 1582 in proceedings against Robert Montgomery, promoted by the crown to the archbishopric of Glasgow in defiance of the wishes of the general assembly. Pont urged Montgomery to &#145;give over all simplie, and come in the kirk's will&#146;  (Calderwood, 3.604). He also informed the privy council that the presbyteries of Dalkeith, Linlithgow, and Edinburgh refused to recognize its interference in the proceedings against Montgomery in the ecclesiastical courts.<br>
<br>A supporter of the presbyterian cause, Pont composed, with Thomas Smeton, the act of the general assembly in October 1582 approving the Ruthven raid, when a group of ultra-protestant lords led by the earl of Gowrie had ended the ascendancy of the duke of Lennox in August 1582 in a palace revolution by capturing the king. Following James's escape from the Ruthven raiders in June 1583, the onset of the Arran regime, with its hostility to presbyterianism, signalled a strong conservative reaction. In May 1584 Pont protested &#145;in name of the rest&#146; that the church was not obliged to acquiesce in the <span class="roman">Black Acts</span> which asserted royal supremacy over the church and its government by bishops, in the belief that the legislation was &#145;repugnant to the Word of God&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 7, nos. 146, 148). He refused to sign the subscription required by the crown acknowledging the authority of bishops and when charged to compear before the privy council, he followed the example of other ministers by fleeing. In July he was reported to be forfeited for his action in protesting against the <span class="roman">Black Acts</span>; and in December he was numbered among the banished ministers. According to John Spottiswoode, after the two Edinburgh ministers James Lawson and Walter Balcanquhal had fled to England, Pont &#145;took instruments in the hands of a notary of the Church's disassenting&#146; from the legislation of 1584, after which &#145;he likewise fleeing was denounced rebel&#146; and removed from his position as judge  (Spottiswoode, 2.315).<br>
<br>With the return in November 1585 of the lords and some of the ministers who had sought sanctuary in England under Arran's administration, Pont resumed his ministry at St Cuthbert's and, together with Andrew Melville and others, wrote to the remaining ministers in England urging them to return home also. In May 1586 he opened the first general assembly to have met since Arran's fall from power and welcomed the presence of the king, if with reservations: &#145;we trust your Majestie speeketh without hypocrisie&#146;  (Calderwood, 5.549). He opposed Archbishop Patrick Adamson's relaxation from excommunication in 1586, and, on the general assembly's advice, he declined the king's offer of the bishopric of Caithness in 1587. As the assembly explained to the king, Pont was &#145;alreadie a Bischop according to the doctrine of Sanct Paul, and qualified to use the functioun of a Pastor or Minister at the Kirk of Dornoch&#146; and to serve as visitor for the churches in Caithness, &#145;but as to that corrupt estate or office of them quho hes bein termed Bischops heirtofoir, we find it not agreable to the Word of God, and it hes bein damnit in diverse uther our Assemblies&#146;  (Thomson, 2.697&#150;8). At a meeting of parliament in 1587 Pont and others, with the general assembly's approval, submitted a petition&#151;only to be rejected&#151;opposing churchmen who sat and voted in name of the church but not on behalf of the church. By 1598, however, he did come to accept in principle the idea of ecclesiastical representation in parliament, which the king promoted as a means for reinstating bishops.<br>
<br>Pont was invited to attend the queen's coronation in 1590. He remained steadfast in upholding the liberty of the church, reminding the king in 1591 that &#145;there is a judgment above yours and that is God's putt in the hand of the ministrie&#146;  (Calderwood, 5.131); and in 1592 he was one of several appointed by the assembly to draw up articles for the annulment of the <span class="roman">Black Acts</span> of 1584. Rebuking the nation's lukewarmness in caring for religion, in a sermon preached in 1594, he censured the king's behaviour, affirming that &#145;we could not pray with David's people to fulfill the desire of the king's heart, becaus we suspected our king's heart not to be upright; which the countenancing of evill men, and unreverent hearing of the Word, declared&#146;  (Calderwood, 5.329).<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsandlaterpublications"></a>Last years and later publications</h2>By 1587 Pont's first wife had died, leaving two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22508/', "Timothy Pont (fl. 1574&#150;1611)")</script> and Zachary, minister of Bower, and four daughters, Helen, Margaret, Catherine, and Beatrix. With Margaret Smyth, his second or third wife, he had three sons, James, Robert, and Jonathan. It was earlier thought that he had married in 1587 Sarah Denholm as his second wife and that she was the mother of his daughter Beatrix but this is now not considered the case.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Pont began to publish again. <span class="italic">Against Sacrilege: Three Sermons</span> and <span class="italic">A newe treatise of the right reckoning of yeares, and ages of the world and mens lives, and of the estate of the last decaying age thereof</span> both appeared in 1599. When a new translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> was proposed in 1601, Pont was asked by the assembly to revise the metrical translation of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>. By November 1602 the assembly approved a petition by Pont:<blockquote>desyreand, in respect of his great age, and long travells takin in the Kirk of God, and continuall seiknes quhilk followeth age, that he might be releivit from the ordinarie burdein of the teaching, upon conditioun that he sall substitute ane in his place quhen through infirmitie he sall not be able to teach himselfe. (Thomson, 3.1001&#150;2)</blockquote>Pont celebrated James VI's accession to the English throne in <span class="italic">De unione Britanniae</span> (1604), which he dedicated to the king, extolling the benefits of unity for religion and political stability. The same year he issued <span class="italic">Canticum canticorum Solomonis</span>, an exposition through <span class="roman">Song of Songs</span> of the allegory of Christ and his church. He was still active enough two years later to protest at the prosecution of those ministers imprisoned for approving the Aberdeen general assembly which James had prohibited from meeting, but he died on 8 May 1606. He was buried in the churchyard of St Cuthbert's. Another chronological work appeared posthumously as <span class="italic">De Sabbaticorum annorum periodis chronologica a mundi exordio ad nostra usque secula et porro digestio</span> (1619).<br>
