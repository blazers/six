<span class="headword">Staggins,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1700), <span class="occ">musician and composer</span>, was the son of Isaac Staggins (<i>d</i>. 1684), a court musician since 1660, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1701). Both men held posts as violinists and as wind players (Isaac played the shawm and Nicholas the flute). Nicholas replaced William Young (<i>d</i>. 1670), and on 15 August 1674 was also made &#145;Master of his Majesty's violins&#146; jointly with Thomas Purcell, following the death of Pelham Humfrey. Louis Grabu, master of the king's musick, was dismissed in the wake of the decree banning all Roman Catholics from court, which came into force in November 1673, with Staggins serving in his stead from Michaelmas 1674. He was immediately thrust to the forefront of preparations for the extravagant court masque <span class="italic">Calisto</span>, which after several postponements was finally premi&egrave;red on 22 February 1675. Staggins wrote the songs (some are extant in BL, Add. MS 19759) and headed the thirty-three violins in the performance.<br>
<br>Staggins was appointed deputy marshal of the Corporation of Musick in Westminster on 17 December 1675. About 1676&#150;7 he undertook a European journey, which is confirmed by a petition for arrears of 5 June 1695  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. C 421, fol. 199), in which he speaks of &#145;Travels in France &hellip; Italy, &amp; other Forrin Parts, to capacitate &amp; make my self fit for the Service of His Late Maty Kg Charles the Second&#146;.<br>
<br>Staggins was granted a doctorate in music at Cambridge in 1682, and the grace appointing him first professor of music there is dated 2 July 1684. According to Anthony Wood, &#145;His exercise should have been 8 parts for voices and compositions for instrumental music but by the favour of Dr James then Vice-Chancellor, he only composed his exercise for instruments&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Wood D 19(4)).<br>
<br>Staggins was steward at the St Cecilia festivals in 1684 and 1685. Little survives of his music, which suggests that it was of poor quality. A few songs were published in contemporary collections; others remain in manuscript, together with a few slight instrumental airs. Staggins seems to have composed odes for William III's birthdays in at least 1693, 1694, and 1696. Some of his songs are settings of texts from contemporary plays, while &#145;an entertainment of vocal and instrumental musick, composed by Dr Staggins&#146; was advertised in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> to take place at York Buildings on 10 May 1697. Staggins, who had a house at Little Chelsea, died at Windsor Castle during the night of 12&#150;13 June 1700 and was buried at St George's Chapel, Windsor, on 16 June; he was survived by his mother, two brothers, and a sister. He was unmarried.<br>
