<span class="headword">Caplat,  Moran Victor Hingston</span>  (1916&#150;2003), <span class="occ">actor and opera administrator</span>, was born on 1 October 1916 at Tantallon, Alma Road, Herne Bay, Kent, the only child of (Armand Charles Victor) Roger Caplat, later known as Roger Victor Caplat, or Roger Armand Charles Caplat, architect, and his wife, Norah Bessie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hingston. His father, who was French, came to Herne Bay at the age of eighteen to learn English, staying on to become a draughtsman in an architect's office and then a qualified architect. In 1915 he married a local girl, Norah Hingston.<br>
<br>Caplat was educated at St George's, Herne Bay, a dame school, and from the age of twelve at Herne Bay College. He became stage-struck after seeing <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> by the Ben Greet Players in the Canterbury chapter house garden, and in 1933 he applied successfully to become a student at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. His passing-out play, George Bernard Shaw's <span class="italic">Androcles and the Lion</span>, in which he played the Lion, was supervised by the author. On leaving RADA he was engaged by the Margate repertory. From there he played at the Croydon repertory, then toured with Matheson Lang in a play by Marguerite Steen, <span class="italic">Matador</span>, and in 1938 took part in Stephen Spender's first play, <span class="italic">The Trial of a Judge</span>, at the Unity Theatre, London. He also worked for the BBC and acted in two films, both in 1938: <span class="italic">The Challenge</span>, an account of Edward Whymper's ascent of the Matterhorn, and <span class="italic">A Royal Divorce</span>, a melodrama about Napoleon and Josephine. His final engagement as an actor was with the Sevenoaks repertory company.<br>
<br>Caplat's youthful passion was sailing. He had owned a boat since the age of ten and his summer holidays were spent exploring the countless bays and inlets of the Thames estuary in his dinghy <i>Oakey</i>. Later he crewed in a larger yacht, <i>Phryna</i>, which raced to Fastnet and the Baltic. In the summer of 1939 <i>Phryna</i> raced to La Rochelle and was returning home on 3 September when the Second World War broke out. Caplat had joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Supplementary Reserve (for yachtsmen with a basic knowledge of navigation) the year before, and he was called up on 13 October. After only five days' training at HMS <i>King Alfred</i> in Hove, Caplat was posted to Thurso, where he joined the <i>Northern Isles</i>, a converted deep-sea trawler on the northern patrol, as navigating officer. Going on leave in June 1940, he was diverted to Sheerness, where he joined a paddle steamer which chugged across the channel to Dunkirk to rescue several hundred British soldiers, bringing them safely back to Ramsgate. Caplat was then sent to Halifax, Nova Scotia, to collect one of the destroyers offered to the Royal Navy by the American government, and sail her back to Britain. HMS <i>Bradford</i> was old and decrepit, and after only a few trips on convoy duty in the north Atlantic she was decommissioned.<br>
<br>Caplat volunteered for submarines, and after training he joined HMS <i>Tempest</i>, a new submarine which sailed to Malta with aviation spirit in her buoyancy tanks. Taking part in an operation off Taranto, <i>Tempest</i> was sunk by an Italian frigate, which picked up the surviving members of the crew. Caplat was taken to a transit camp near Bari, then to a camp in Tuscany, and finally south again to Certosa di Padula, an old Carthusian monastery, where he produced several plays, including <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>. In March 1943 he was repatriated, via Turkey, Egypt, and Algiers. He was married to Diana Murray Downton, to whom he had become engaged before sailing to the Mediterranean, on 29 May. She was the 19-year-old daughter of Arthur Murray Downton, road surveyor, of Offham, Kent. Caplat was appointed to another submarine, HMS <i>Tradewind</i>, after his marriage, but it soon became apparent that he was not fit for service at sea, and he moved to a shore establishment. In autumn 1944 he took a staff course at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. The war in Europe was entering its final phase, and Caplat was put in charge of the return of all naval prisoners of war.<br>
<br>Awaiting demobilization in September 1945, Caplat was asked to audition for a job as assistant manager of Glyndebourne, the opera house near Lewes in Sussex founded by John Christie and his wife, the singer Audrey Mildmay. He saw Rudolf Bing, the general manager, in London, and then met the Christies at the Savoy Hotel. When he was offered the job he accepted. He was able to get his demobilization advanced and on 1 October 1945, his twenty-ninth birthday, he joined, in his own words, &#145;the good ship Glyndebourne&#146;. Glyndebourne, originally opened in 1934, had been closed during the war. Now plans were in hand to reopen the opera house. Bing was also planning the Edinburgh International Festival, and when he became director of the festival in 1947, Caplat became manager of Glyndebourne. Two operas, Mozart's <span class="italic">Le nozze di Figaro</span> and Verdi's <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, both from the pre-war repertory, were performed at the first Edinburgh Festival, and two more in 1948 and in 1949, after which Bing left Britain to become director of the Metropolitan Opera, New York. Caplat became general manager of Glyndebourne, and moved in 1953 with his wife and family to a large house in Barcombe a few miles away.<br>
<br>Though Caplat knew nothing of opera when he arrived at Glyndebourne, his theatrical experience turned out to be invaluable while the administrative skills he had learned in the navy were equally useful. He rapidly settled into the opera house routine when Glyndebourne gave a short season (fourteen performances of two operas) in Sussex in 1950, as well as two operas in Edinburgh. By 1960 this had risen to seventy performances of six operas at Glyndebourne. Caplat's job entailed a great deal of travelling round Europe in order to hear singers. At first these trips were made with Audrey Mildmay. After her death in 1953 he travelled either with Jani Strasser, head of music staff, or alone. He was also responsible for arranging tours made by the company abroad. In 1954 Glyndebourne took Rossini's <span class="italic">La Cenerentola</span> to Berlin; and in 1958 the company performed Verdi's <span class="italic">Falstaff</span> and Rossini's <span class="italic">Le Comte Ory</span> in Paris. <span class="italic">Falstaff</span>, designed by Osbert Lancaster, whom Caplat had introduced to Glyndebourne in 1953 to design Stravinsky's <span class="italic">The Rake's Progress</span>, was a particular triumph.<br>
<br>Glyndebourne visited Scandinavia in 1967, opening in the eighteenth-century theatre at Drottningholm, outside Stockholm, with <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span> and Cimarosa's <span class="italic">Matrimonio segreto</span>. The tour continued to Oslo, G&ouml;teborg, and Copenhagen. Two years later Glyndebourne took Cavalli's <span class="italic">Ormindo</span> to the Cuvilli&eacute;stheater in Munich. John Christie retired as chairman in 1959 (he died in 1962) and was succeeded by his 25-year-old son George. Caplat guided the young man for a while, but George proved a proficient pupil and soon became his own master. Music directors and directors of production also changed: the pre-war team of Fritz Busch and Carl Ebert was followed by Vittorio Gui and G&uuml;nther Rennert, then by John Pritchard and John Cox, and then by Bernard Haitink and Peter Hall. Caplat, who was appointed CBE in 1968, provided the continuity that allowed Glyndebourne to develop and grow, without losing its essential style. Caplat never sat through a complete opera, but he was fascinated by the rehearsal process and attended every rehearsal that his other duties permitted. Once a production was launched, he lost interest.<br>
<br>Spring and summer were the busiest seasons of the year at Glyndebourne, but Caplat found time for sailing as skipper of <i>Griffin</i>, the Ocean Racing Club's yacht. He was suitably nautical in appearance, being described by one obituarist as beginning &#145;to look like the sea dog on the front of a packet of Players' Medium Navy Cut cigarettes&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 26 June 2003). He retired on 1 October 1981, his sixty-fifth birthday. His memoirs, <span class="italic">Dinghies to Divas, or, Comedy on the Bridge</span>, were published in 1985. With his wife he moved from their house in Barcombe to a cottage in Newick. He died on 19 June 2003 at the Kent and Sussex Hospital, Tunbridge Wells, following a stroke. He was survived by his wife, Diana, two daughters, and a son, one son having predeceased him.<br>
