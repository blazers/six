<span class="headword">Rice,  Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1820, <em>d.</em> 1880), <span class="occ">actor, theatre manager and playwright</span>, was born in Brompton, London, where he was baptized on 6 February 1820, the son of Thomas Rice, a mason, and his wife, Mary. His father is said to have undertaken building work at Buckingham Palace. An inclination towards art led to Charles Rice's being apprenticed to an engraver and to his preparing drawings for publication by the Royal College of Surgeons. However, finding some of his subjects&#151;especially the head of a murdered woman&#151;too distressing, he ran away from home and joined a company of players on a circuit in the southern counties.<br>
<br>Rice's career reflects the major changes in nineteenth-century provincial theatre, from the days when an actor&#150;manager depended on providing an annual season at each of a circuit of theatres to maintain his stock company, to the era of considerable investment in new theatre buildings, open for most of the year, to host touring productions, usually from the London stage.<br>
<br>As an actor Rice's chief talent was for low comedy, but he was versatile enough to succeed in roles as varied as those of the Artful Dodger, Rip van Winkle, played with &#145;quaint humour and pathos&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bradford Observer</span>, 13 April 1880), and King Lear. He delighted in stage machinery and applied his artistic skills to set design and painting scenery. In 1844 he formed a partnership with John Mosley, which lasted until 1847, to run a west Yorkshire circuit of theatres in Bradford (for which Rice designed a new fa&ccedil;ade), Huddersfield, and Wakefield. Rice dramatized episodes of local significance for the Bradford theatre, including <span class="italic">The Gibbet Law of Halifax, or, A Legend of Kirklees Abbey</span> (<i>c</i>.1846).<br>
<br>In August 1850 Rice's adaptation of <span class="italic">The Three Musketeers</span> was performed in Manchester. From 1851 to 1868 he was associated primarily with London theatres, including the Grecian Theatre, where his pantomime <span class="italic">The Fairy and the Fawn</span> was put on in 1852, and the Surrey, Britannia, and Strand theatres, as a playwright and actor, but he starred also at Glasgow and at provincial theatres. On 24 December 1856 he married Hoxton-born Harriet (or Harriot) Hart, who, although not herself an actress, shared his love of design and worked with him in management.<br>
<br>Rice began management on his own account at Oldham, where he took a three-year lease of the Working Men's Hall at &pound;300 a year, opening it with a stock company as the Theatre Royal in August 1865 with his own play <span class="italic">The Stricken Oak</span>, in which he made use of Professor Pepper's ghost illusion and which had already been put on that same year in Glasgow and York. His first Christmas pantomime at Oldham that year was his own <span class="italic">Koh-i-noor</span>, which contained &#145;extraordinary mechanical effects rather surprising to see attempted on this stage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oldham Evening Chronicle</span>, 23 Dec 1865). In 1868 Rice moved to Bradford, where he leased the recently built Theatre Royal, Manningham Lane, and where he remained until his death, from cirrhosis, at his home, 1 Drewton Street, Bradford, on 12 April 1880. For much of the year the Bradford theatre served as a receiving theatre for touring productions, but Rice created an annual in-house pantomime, for which he was widely celebrated.<br>
<br>In 1873 Rice took over the running of Covent Garden theatre for the Christmas period, putting on his own <span class="italic">Red Riding Hood and Little Bo-Peep</span> with a profusion of bad puns, a transformation scene that was a &#145;triumph of mechanism and art&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 27 Dec 1873), and allusions to the new school boards and to the Tichborne claimant. The following year saw his <span class="italic">Babes in the Wood and the Big Bed of Ware</span>. <span class="italic">Cinderella and the Little Glass Slipper</span> followed in 1875, when he &#145;shone above his competitors in manufacturing the worst imaginable play upon words&#146; and when the transformation scene included &#145;all sorts of ladies suspended in all sorts of happily impossible positions from all sorts of fabulous trees and branches of extraneous growth&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 Dec 1875).<br>
<br>Rice was spoken of as a &#145;kindly and genial gentleman&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bradford Observer</span>, 13 April 1880), and he had a reputation for generosity in providing benefits for various causes at his theatres. He was a freemason and was a member of the Hope Lodge at Bradford. The Rices had no children, and Mrs Rice continued to manage the theatre until her own death in 1887.<br>
