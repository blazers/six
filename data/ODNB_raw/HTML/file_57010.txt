<span class="headword">Rorie,  David</span>  (1867&#150;1946), <span class="occ">poet and folklorist</span>, was born on 17 March 1867 in Edinburgh, the second son of George Livingston Rorie, a manager with the Royal Bank of Scotland, and his wife, Elizabeth Paterson. He was educated at the collegiate school of Aberdeen and at the universities of Aberdeen and Edinburgh, graduating MB CM in 1890, and MD in 1908, with a thesis &#145;Scottish folk-medicine&#146;. In 1894 he became medical officer at Bowhill colliery in Fife, where his research into the customs and beliefs of the local mining and fishing communities led to an influential series of articles in the pioneering field of medical folklore. On 2 August of that same year, he married Margaret Elizabeth, daughter of James William Miller MD. In 1905 he moved to Cults, on the outskirts of Aberdeen, where he practised for the rest of his career. He held a reserve commission in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and was mobilized with the 1st highland field ambulance on the outbreak of the First World War, rising to brevet-colonel. He was made a DSO and member of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and received two mentions in dispatches.<br>
<br>Rorie's fame is chiefly as a poet and songwriter. The dazzling energy, audacious rhyme, and extravagant surreal logic of pieces like &#145;The lum hat wantin' the croon&#146; and &#145;The Pawky Duke&#146; place him among the foremost exponents of Scottish comic song. His creative writing in poetry and prose has a similar pungency and wit, although not without a persistent tinge of melancholy and pessimism. There are two collected editions: <span class="italic">The Lum Hat Wantin' the Croon, and other Poems</span> (1935) and <span class="italic">David Rorie: Poems and Prose</span> (ed. William Donaldson, 1983).<br>
<br>Rorie was a kenspeckle figure, a man of many committees: president of the Caledonian Medical Society and a leading light in the Aberdeen Medico-Chirurgical Society, as well as in quaintly-titled fraternities such as the &#145;Calm Soughers&#146; and the &#145;Sit Siccars&#146; where he met his friend the poet Charles Murray. Dapper, genial, and gregarious, he enjoyed enormous popularity as a public speaker and, from the later 1920s, as a broadcaster.<br>
<br>He was a gifted exponent of the fiercely reductive humour of the Scottish communities in which he lived; his poem &#145;The Obituary Notice&#146; captures with typical irony the folk's jaundiced view of earthly grandeur such as his:<blockquote>
<div>Ony wey, the cratur's awa<br>
</div>
<div>An' here's a lang bittie aboot 'im i' the papers:<br>
</div>
<div>&#145;Much respeckit member o' the community.&#146;<br>
</div>
<div>Imph'm.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>David Rorie died at his home, 17 Hazeldene, Road, Hazlehead, Aberdeen, on 18 February 1946, and was cremated at Craigiebuckler, Aberdeen, on 24 February 1946. He was survived by his wife, and a son and daughter.<br>
