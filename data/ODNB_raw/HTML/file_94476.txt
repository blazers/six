<span class="headword">Juyn, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1440), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was the son of John Juhyne (<i>d</i>. 1390), a prominent Bristol wool merchant, and his wife, Margery, from whom he inherited estates in Bristol, and in Bedminster and Knowle, Somerset. His connections with the Bristol merchant community were to serve him well throughout his career; he was recorder of Bristol from at least 1422 until 1438, and acted often as a feoffee in the property transactions of the town's leading merchants. Indeed his first appearance in the records is as a mainpernor in chancery in 1407 for Bristol merchants sued for debt in London, by which time he was undoubtedly practising law at Westminster. His opinions were first reported in the year-books in 1409 and frequently thereafter. Called to the order of serjeant-at-law in February 1415, he managed to avoid the bestowal of this degree, with its heavy financial burden, until Trinity term 1418. As counsel to the duchy of Lancaster between 1416 and 1422 he took a leading role in the division of the Bohun inheritance between Henry V and his cousin Lady Anne Stafford, settling the <i>scire facias</i> writ of 1420 and engrossing the final partition, with his fellow serjeant James Strangeways, in 1421. He was also retained by the king's brother, Thomas, duke of Clarence, from at least 1418 until 1420.<br>
<br>Juyn rode the western circuit as an assize justice in the period 1422&#150;4, before switching to the home counties circuit, following his double appointment as chief baron of the exchequer and justice in the court of common pleas on 5 May 1423. He was knighted in May 1426, during the Leicester parliament, with the king and many others, attired in vestments of cloth of gold. A trier of parliamentary petitions from 1425 to 1439, he was often summoned to advise the king's council during the same period. Most notably, he attended the council at Reading in November 1426 for fifteen days, when ordinances were drawn up to ensure the peace between Cardinal Beaufort and Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, and was granted a tun of wine yearly from the port of London for his expenses.<br>
<br>Despite his national prominence, Juyn's interests retained a regional focus. He was named to every peace commission in Somerset, where he resided, from 1419 until his death, and raised loans there for the government of Henry VI in the 1420s and 1430s. He was frequently appointed to commissions of inquiry throughout the west country, particularly regarding mercantile matters, such as customs offences, or when the interests of the many regional magnates whom he served were involved. He was employed by the baronial families of Lovell, Berkeley, Bonville, Botreaux, and Hungerford, and by Nicholas Bubwith, bishop of Bath and Wells, and acted as executor of the latter's will of 1424. Because he was counsel and friend to both Walter, first Baron Hungerford, and William, third Baron Botreaux, he was chosen as the final arbiter of the contract drawn up for the marriage of their children in 1420. He was also appointed to arbitrate, among other aristocratic disputes, in the famous lawsuit over the Berkeley inheritance, and made no less than three awards upon it, including the settlement of 1425, which was accepted by both parties until the death of the thirteenth earl of Warwick in 1439.<br>
<br>At least one of Juyn's two wives had a noble connection. The parentage of his first wife, Edith, remains obscure. The couple was granted life tenure of two estates in Somerset&#151;Fisshewerez in Chew Magna, by Bishop Bubwith in 1424, and the manor of Belluton, by James Botiller, earl of Ormond, in 1427&#151;but nothing else is known of Edith. By 1436, after her death, childless, he had married Alice, daughter of William Bythemore, esquire, and his wife, Jane, daughter of Richard de la Warr, younger son of Roger, Lord de la Warr, who settled the Somerset manor of Battleborough upon the couple and their issue. Three of Sir John's other manors (in Long Ashton and Stanton Drew, Somerset, and West Hanham, Gloucestershire) were probably acquired by purchase. He resided, however, in a fortified manor house known as Inyn's Court (now Inn's Court), at Bishopsworth, in Knowle, near Bristol. According to local tradition, this impressive residence had seven towers, a moat, and a central courtyard, some of which survived into the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>On 9 February 1436 Juyn was appointed chief justice of the common pleas, still retaining his position as chief baron of the exchequer, and was granted an additional annual reward of 140 marks. Although never a puisne justice of the king's bench, on 20 January 1439 he became its chief justice, as the senior representative of a depleted judiciary. Only upon this promotion did he relinquish his exchequer post, as well as the chief justiceship of the common pleas, but was commanded thrice to continue as an assize justice, despite the statutory exemption of the chief justices from assizes. His annual reward of 180 marks was augmented in July 1439 with a further 40 marks per annum and a tun of wine from the port of Bristol, probably in recognition of these extra duties. These evidently took their toll; Juyn held his new office for only a year before becoming ill. By his will of 21 January 1440 he bequeathed the contents of his chapel and the cloth of gold worn at his dubbing ceremony to the lady chapel of the church of St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, where he was buried under a fine monumental brass, still <i>in situ</i>. He died on 24 March 1440, and was survived by his wife, who afterwards married John Chudderlegh of Hinton St George, Somerset, and their two children&#151;Elizabeth, later the wife of Robert Kenn of Kenn, Somerset, and his heir, William, then eighteen months old. After William's death in 1503, the Juyn estates, which cannot have been worth less than &pound;100 per annum, passed to William's daughter, and eventually to Elizabeth's heirs.<br>
