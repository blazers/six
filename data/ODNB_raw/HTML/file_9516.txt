<span class="headword">Fitch,  Ralph</span>  (1550?&#150;1611), <span class="occ">merchant and traveller</span>, whose origins and date of birth are obscure, is first heard of when, by the age of twenty-four or twenty-five, he completed an apprenticeship in London and became a member of the Leathersellers' Company. In 1575 the company extended a loan of &pound;50 to him, interest-free for two years, as part of a fund to assist young members in establishing a business. Eight years later he had accrued capital of at least &pound;140.<br>
<br>Fitch was the first Englishman to make an extensive journey through India and south-east Asia. He travelled in 1583 with John Newberry, a merchant, John Story, a painter, and William Leeds, a jeweller, as far as Fatehpur Sikri, the court city of Akbar, the Mughal emperor (<i>r</i>. 1556&#150;1605). From there he left his compatriots and sailed first down the Ganges and then to Bengal, Burma, and as far as Malacca, returning by way of Ceylon and Cochin. Fitch wrote an account of this journey, which was published by Richard Hakluyt in his 1598 edition of <span class="italic">The Principal Navigations &hellip; of the English Nation</span>.<br>
<br>Fitch's journey to Asia was part of an attempt to break Venetian and Portuguese control of the pepper and spice trade. In 1578 Richard Staper and Edward Osborne had provided the financial and William Cecil, Lord Burghley, the political backing for William Harborne to negotiate commercial privileges and establish a trade with the Ottoman empire. In 1581 this same group founded the Turkey Company. At the same time John Newberry, twice between 1578 and 1582, explored the commercial potential of the overland route, including the Euphrates valley, Armenia, and Persia. A similar motive to negotiate commercial privileges can be inferred for the journey of 1583 from the official letters of Elizabeth I which Newberry and Fitch were to present to the Mughal and Chinese emperors.<br>
<br>In February 1583 Fitch, Newberry, Story, Leeds, and two merchants, John Eldred and William Shales, left London on the merchant ship <i>Tiger</i>. From Aleppo it took them three weeks to reach Basrah, where Eldred and Shales remained behind to trade. Unable to find a suitable translator who could speak the &#145;Indian tongue&#146;, presumably Hindustani, the other four in the group proceeded to Hormoz, a Portuguese island city at the mouth of the Persian Gulf.<br>
<br>With working capital of 9000 reales, or over &pound;2000, Fitch and Newberry tried to exploit some of the commercial opportunities available to them in Basrah and Hormoz. Among the commodities they sold, some to Don Mathias de Albequerque, the governor of Hormoz, were a set of gilded cutlery, emeralds, woollen cloth, and kerseys. Greater experience of the markets would have to be gained before profits could be assured, however: &#145;There is much of our things&#146;, wrote Fitch in a letter, &#145;which sell very well and some we shall get nothing for.&#146;<br>
<br>Whatever commercial contacts Fitch and Newberry made with Albequerque, the governor nevertheless incarcerated them, after a week in Hormoz, on charges of sedition. According to Newberry, a Venetian, Michael Stropeni, had spread rumours of their support for the pretender to the Portuguese throne, Dom Antonio. Albequerque shipped the Englishmen to the viceroyalty of Goa to face the charges before the chief justice.<br>
<br>In Goa, after three weeks in gaol and after the intercession of local Jesuits, the four Englishmen were released from prison on a bond of 2000 ducats. Story took a commission offered by the Jesuits to paint St Paul's Church. Hearing rumours that trumped-up charges were being prepared against them, Fitch, Newberry, and Leeds fled to neighbouring Bijapur. They journeyed northwards to Agra in order to seek an audience, of which we know nothing, with Akbar in Fatehpur Sikri.<br>
<br>After three months at court the three members of the group separated. Leeds took service as a court jeweller. Newberry was to set off on an overland journey to Aleppo. Fitch was to travel down the Jumna and Ganges rivers in order to explore Bengal, Burma, and Malacca. Fitch and Newberry arranged to meet in two years' time at Pegu, the principal court city in Burma. Newberry disappeared, however, and presumably died either in the Punjab or in Persia; and so, after waiting for a year beyond the agreed time, Fitch made his own way back to London.<br>
<br>An itinerary of the principal places Fitch visited shows the extent of his explorations. In September 1585 he left Agra on a fleet of boats taking goods to Bengal: the journey down the Jumna and Ganges took five months, as he passed though Allahabad, Benares, and Patna before arriving in February 1586 in Hooghly, the principal Bengalese factory of the Portuguese. He then explored the towns of Bengal, and by November 1586 had arrived in Chittagong and Serampore. From there he sailed east to Pegu. Besides these largely coastal explorations, he made month-long treks into the interior of Bengal, at Cooch Behar, and of Burma and Jangomes (Chiang Mai). In February 1587 Fitch reached the furthest east he would go on his travels, having arrived at Malacca, where he stayed for at least a year.<br>
<br>Beginning in April 1588 Fitch made his way from Malacca progressively, if slowly, to the west, first sailing for Pegu, then in September for Hooghly, in March 1589 for Ceylon and Cochin, and in November for Goa and Chaul. After a delay in securing passage he sailed for Hormoz, and travelled overland through Armenia to Aleppo. When in April 1591 he arrived back in London he had been travelling for eight years. On his return he found that, because he had been missing for over seven years, he had in February 1590 been declared dead by his family and his first will had been proved.<br>
<br>Fitch recollected his journey at the behest of Hakluyt, and it was first presented to Burghley before publication in <span class="italic">The Principal Navigations</span>. Like many early travellers Fitch reiterated or copied the details of previously published accounts. One of his principal sources was the <span class="italic">Viaggio</span> (1587) of Cesar Federici, a Venetian merchant, which Thomas Hickock translated and published in London in 1588.<br>
<br>Following largely though not exclusively from Federici, Fitch concentrated on observations of commercial or anthropological interest. Cotton cloth, for example, was produced in Patna and Orissa, and was of the best quality in Serampore; jewels, including rubies, emeralds, and sapphires, could be found in places such as Caplan in Burma; Pegu and Malacca were the two places he visited where pepper, spices, drugs, and jewels from Java, Borneo, Timor, and China might be found. Otherwise he recounted the beliefs, customs, and exotic appearance of those he encountered. Women often wore elaborate necklaces, earrings, and bracelets, such as those made, for example, in Benares of silver, copper, or tin and set with amber or agate. In Burma, at Jamenhy, people who recovered from illness celebrated by offering meat to the devil; and at Pegu, people would eat animals that were taboo in England, including dogs, cats, rats, and snakes. Underlying recollections such as these was an inability to accept unfamiliar religions and incompatible beliefs. Fitch identified many of the people he encountered as idolators. Most harmful were the charlatans who took advantage of credulous people, such as the one in Patna who posed as a prophet; Brahman priests were &#145;a kind of crafty people, worse than Jews&#146;.<br>
<br>In the final twenty years of his life Fitch traded in or to Aleppo, acted as a consultant to the East India Company, and held office in the Leathersellers' Company. In new deeds of incorporation signed in 1592 the Levant Company laid claim to the overland trade to Basrah and Hormoz, explored by Fitch, Newberry, and Eldred, and in that deed Fitch was named as a member of the company. In 1595 the general court elected him consul at Aleppo, a position he declined; but in that year, nevertheless, he went there to trade. On his return to London in 1599 he paid a &pound;10 fine to avoid service in the Leathersellers' Company as warden of the yeomanry and was shortly thereafter admitted to the livery. When the East India Company was established in 1599, despite having made the first explorations of Asia, Fitch did not become a founding member. He intermittently assisted the directors, none the less, translating official letters into Portuguese or providing, in 1606, the appropriate titles for Akbar's successor, Jahangir (<i>r</i>. 1605&#150;1627). Through the Leathersellers' Company he loaned money for ventures to Virginia and Ireland. In 1608 the company elected him to be an assistant, and at the same time he performed the duties of renter warden. In August 1611, at the age of sixty-one, he was elected warden, but served only two months before his death in October that year.<br>
<br>In his final years Fitch lived in the parish of St Katharine Cree, just off Leadenhall Street. In neither of his wills does he mention a wife or offspring. Instead he left &pound;1000 in bequests to the descendants of a brother, Thomas, and a sister, Frances, and his principal beneficiaries were grandnephews, Talbot and Thomas Fitch. Among the bequests were small sums for poor children at Christ's Hospital and to the Leathersellers' Company for honorary silver spoons and drinks.<br>
