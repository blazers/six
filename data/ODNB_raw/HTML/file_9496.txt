<span class="headword">Fisher,  James</span>  (1697&#150;1775), <span class="occ">a founder of the Secession church</span>, was born on 22 January 1697 in Barr, Ayrshire, the eldest son of Thomas Fisher (1669&#150;1721), the minister of Barr at the time of his birth, and Susanna Menzies. In 1699 the family moved to Rhynd, Perthshire, where his father remained the minister for twenty-two years. Fisher attended the universities of Glasgow and St Andrews and then studied divinity in Edinburgh. After his father's death he moved with his mother and sisters to the proximity of Portmoak and attended <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8853/', "Ebenezer Erskine's")</script> ministry there. He was licensed by the presbytery of Perth on 31 October 1722 and was subsequently called to Kinclaven, Perthshire, on 5 October 1725, and ordained there on 23 December. On 4 July 1727 he married Ebenezer Erskine's daughter Jean (<i>d</i>. 1771), with whom he had fifteen children, seven of whom survived to maturity.<br>
<br>Fisher joined in signing the representation and petition presented to the general assembly of 1732, complaining of the assembly's disregard of that call and consent by the Christian people which is necessary to establish a pastoral relationship, as well as of innovations in preaching. He also joined the protest submitted against the refusal of the committee on bills and overtures to transmit the representation and petition to the assembly itself. In October 1732 his father-in-law preached in Kinclaven, according to local tradition delivering the same sermon he preached before the synod a few days later. The sermon had a very different effect on the two audiences: the synod's admonition ultimately forced Erskine from the Church of Scotland, but in the parish it prepared most of the people to leave it voluntarily.<br>
<br>Fisher played an active part in the process that led to the formation of the Secession church in Scotland. Though the 1733 assembly refused to hear him because he was related by marriage to Erskine, who stood accused, he joined his father-in-law in signing the protest against the assembly's judgment and in consequence was loosed from his charge along with Erskine in November. He subsequently took part in the December meeting at Gairney Bridge at which the Associate Presbytery was formed. As clerk of the Associate Presbytery he assisted William Wilson in preparing the presbytery's <span class="italic">Testimony to the doctrine, worship, government and discipline of the Church of Scotland, or, Reasons &hellip; for their protestation</span> (1734).<br>
<br>The congregation at Kinclaven formally joined the Associate Presbytery in October 1736, though they continued in possession of both the kirk and the manse until August 1741. A meeting place was then built for the church there, but Fisher was called to a newly formed congregation in Glasgow. This grew considerably in the course of his ministry, and a substantial church building was erected. Shortly after his translation to Glasgow, Fisher took part in the controversy over the revivals in Cambuslang and Kilsyth. In <span class="italic">A Review of the Preface to a Narrative of the Extraordinary Work at Kilsyth</span> (1743), he questioned the genuineness of the supposed conversions. He joined with the Associate Presbytery in renewing the covenants in 1743 and in supporting the government during the Jacobite rising of 1745. He believed that taking the burgess oath was lawful, though he asserted that no view of the matter should be imposed as a term of communion. Consequently, in the split which followed he adhered to the Associate (Burgher) Synod, and published his views. When Alexander Moncrieff, who had been training candidates for the ministry for the Associate Presbytery, joined in forming the General Associate (Anti-Burgher) Synod, it was necessary for the Associate (Burgher) Synod to choose another professor. Ebenezer Erskine was assigned that duty initially, but Fisher was instructed to prepare himself to succeed him in the office, and he served in that capacity from 1749 to 1764. He exercised a considerable influence in the synod as one of its most senior and respected figures, and enjoyed a successful ministry in Glasgow until his death there on 28 September 1775.<br>
<br>Although Fisher published several sermons and pamphlets the single work for which he is best known is <span class="italic">The Assembly's Shorter Catechism Explained, by Way of Question and Answer</span>, which was published in two parts in 1753 and 1760. Conceived as a project of the Associate Synod it contained contributions from both Ralph and Ebenezer Erskine, though Fisher was the primary author and editor. In 1768 he revised the work, which was frequently reprinted in Britain and America. It was used widely in the Secession churches and in the larger Presbyterian churches as well, and was still in print early in the twenty-first century.<br>
