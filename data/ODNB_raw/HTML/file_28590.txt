<span class="headword">Walmsley, Sir  Joshua</span>  (1794&#150;1871), <span class="occ">politician</span>, son of John Walmsley and his wife, Elizabeth Berry, was born at Concert Street, Liverpool, on 29 September 1794. His father, a builder, architect, and statuary mason, who owned marble and stone quarries, designed and constructed several notable buildings in Liverpool. Joshua was educated at Knowsley, Lancashire, and Eden Hall, Westmorland. On the death of his father in 1807 he became a teacher in Eden Hall School, and on returning to Liverpool in 1811 took a similar situation in Mr Knowles's school. He was then employed by a corn merchant in 1814, and at the end of his engagement went into the same business himself, and ultimately acquired a comfortable income. He married in 1815 Adeline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mulleneux.<br>
<br>Walmsley was an early advocate of the repeal of the duty on corn, and was afterwards an active member of the Anti-Corn Law League. In 1826 he became president of the Liverpool Mechanics' Institute, and about the same time began his close friendship and business partnership with George Stephenson. Elected a member of the Liverpool town council in 1835, he worked to improve the police, sanitary, and educational affairs of the borough; he was notable for promoting non-sectarian schools. He was appointed mayor in November 1838 and knighted in 1840 on presenting an address to Queen Victoria from the town council of Liverpool on the occasion of her marriage. In 1837 he founded the Tradesmen's Reform Association, which campaigned to secure the ballot, Liberal representation for Liverpool, and repeal of the corn laws. With Palmerston he unsuccessfully contested Liverpool in June 1841. He retired to Ranton Abbey, Staffordshire, in 1843, and at the general election of 1847 was elected MP for Leicester, but was unseated on petition.<br>
<br>Walmsley was the founder in 1848, president, and chief organizer of the National Reform Association and was a supporter of the forty-shilling freehold movement. In 1849 he was returned as MP for Bolton, Lancashire, but in 1852 exchanged that seat for Leicester, where his efforts on behalf of the framework knitters had made him popular. His parliamentary campaign for a reform bill was overshadowed by continental affairs. In his dealings with continental liberals&#151;he was friendly with Louis Kossuth&#151;he opposed all violent actions and, as proprietor of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, he adopted a non-interventionist stance during the Crimean War. He resisted attempts to limit extension of the <span class="roman">Factory Acts</span> and supported the protection and regulation of small workshop trades. He lost his seat in 1857, as a result of a sabbatarian coalition; from 1856 to 1869 he retained the presidency of Joseph Hume's Sunday Society, which campaigned for the opening of museums, galleries, and libraries on Sundays.<br>
<br>Walmsley died on 17 November 1871 at his residence at Hume Towers, Bournemouth. His wife survived him by two years.<br>
