<span class="headword">Payne,  Henry</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Henry Nevill]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1705?), <span class="occ">writer and Jacobite conspirator</span>, was a member of the Payne family of Medbourne, Leicestershire, but although he was born before the civil war he was not the Henry Payne baptized at Medbourne on 29 December 1636. Through his mother he was related to Jane Goodwin (<i>bap</i>. 1618, <i>d</i>. 1658), second wife of Philip Wharton, fourth Baron Wharton, and he had an elder (?) brother, William. Bred a protestant, he claimed to remember Gilbert Sheldon preaching absolutism before Charles I, probably in civil war Oxford. According to a hostile but well-informed 1680 biographer he received little formal education, was apprenticed to a dealer in female clothes, and spent time in Clerkenwell House of Correction for impregnating &#145;Lucrece&#146;, the maidservant. After becoming a servant with the Nevills of Holt, a recusant family owning lands in both Leicestershire (where they had largely supplanted the Medbourne Paynes) and Essex, he eloped with Alice Nevill (<i>d</i>. 1684), apparently daughter of Henry Nevill (<i>d</i>. 1665). Payne thereafter assumed his wife's name with or instead of his own; and for some years advantageously left it unclear whether he was Anglican or Catholic. He was and is therefore sometimes confused with the political philosopher Henry Neville (<i>d</i>. 1694) or the Jesuit Edward Scarisbrick alias Neville&#151;or his own nephew by marriage. By 1681 Alice was &#145;miserably poor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar of Treasury Books</span>, 7.387) and abandoned by the Nevill family for testifying to a Jesuit loan to them; for that reason she received 12<i>s</i>. a week royal bounty until her death. The couple had a daughter, Ursula.<br>
<br>In the 1660s Payne was a theatrical prompter. In 1670, when Lord Berkeley of Stratton became a pro-Catholic lord lieutenant of Ireland, Payne was secretary to his Catholic, and corrupt, private secretary, Sir Elisha Leighton. He played a leading and profitable part in the high-handed intrigues which alienated the city of Dublin, and had a faction appoint him its London agent. After returning to England, Payne furnished the duke's company with three fairly successful plays. <span class="italic">The Fatal Jealousie</span>, appearing before August 1672, and licensed on 22 November, was a domestic tragedy in bad blank verse, with echoes of Shakespeare and Hobbes and some skilful twists of plot. A swashbuckling comedy, <span class="italic">The Morning Ramble</span>, written in nine days, was acted in early 1673. <span class="italic">The Siege of Constantinople</span>, a tragedy acted in 1674 and published in 1675, depicts a Shaftesbury-like chancellor who sets two royal brothers disastrously at odds: Payne visibly admired James, duke of York. With its profits Payne financed a voyage to Jamaica to sell coffee, chocolate, and indentured female servants. He supported Sir Henry Morgan's faction, was arrested by the governor, Lord Vaughan, returned home, and in 1677 furnished Vaughan's successor, the earl of Carlisle, with a useful description of affairs there and suggestions, which included obtaining the slave trading contract for the Spanish Caribbean colonies.<br>
<br>Perhaps inspired by his friend Edward Coleman, Payne became involved in domestic political intrigues: the Green Ribbon Club's first surviving record is a resolution that &#145;Mr Nevil the Pretended Politician&#146; was a papist  (Magd. Cam., Pepys Library, MS 2875, 465). He confidently bought and furnished a large house on credit; but the Popish Plot permanently ruined his finances. On 16 December 1678 Payne was arrested with his manuscript poem &#145;To the Glorious Martyr Edward Coleman Esq.&#146;. Examined by the House of Lords and privy council, he claimed, despite the sentiments it expressed, to be a protestant. He was tried for treasonable practices and imprisoned in the king's bench. There he became deeply involved in the obscure Catholic intrigues which culminated in the Meal-Tub Plot. He worked for the countess of Powis, and with Mrs Elizabeth Cellier until they quarrelled. The perjurer Thomas Dangerfield claimed that Payne was the Catholic party's main propagandist, writing, among other pamphlets, <span class="italic">Some Reflections upon the Earl of Danby</span> accusing the latter of involvement in Sir Edmondbury Godfrey's murder, but that, when temporarily bailed, he preferred the theatre to writing polemics. He was presumably freed by June 1680, when he was one of the defence witnesses ready but not called at the trial of the earl of Castlemaine, who described him as a protestant.<br>
<br>In early 1680 the penny post was first established. Payne was perhaps the least likely of the four persons who claimed to have originated the idea, but Titus Oates denounced it as Payne's invention and therefore intended for papist plotting. His brother William Payne, a chancery clerk, was convicted and fined in June 1682 as part author of a pamphlet claiming that Godfrey had committed suicide.<br>
<br>By 1685 Payne had found a new patron, George Villiers, duke of Buckingham, who though a former exclusionist shared his concern for religious toleration and the theatre. Buckingham's 1685 pamphlet <span class="italic">A Short Discourse</span>, which started the campaign for toleration under James II, began as a &#145;letter&#146; to Payne, who defended it against attackers in <span class="italic">The Persecutor Expos'd</span>, criticizing the Church of England as isolated among the protestant churches, yet claiming absolute right to persecute. He claimed that he had never cringed either to &#145;the Vain Applause of the Eternally mistaken Rabble&#146;  (preface) or to great men. The pamphlet, opposing current government policy, presumably provoked the warrants for treasonable practices issued against him on 16&#150;17 June 1685. After Buckingham's retreat to Yorkshire, Payne supplied him with political newsletters, tried to get his last play staged, and used his yacht for smuggling, to relieve his own desperate finances. Ostentatious Catholic piety won him a receivership of fines in the court of common pleas in April 1686. He collaborated with William Penn in an effort to bring Buckingham back into politics to check the earl of Sunderland's dangerous policies. In March 1687 he accused Sunderland before James of treasonable correspondence with William of Orange, but could not produce sufficient proof.<br>
<br>Following Buckingham's death in April, that summer Payne's creditors (perhaps encouraged by Sunderland, though other courtiers assisted him) put him into the Fleet prison. He nevertheless replied to the marquess of Halifax's <span class="italic">Letter to a Dissenter</span> in <span class="italic">An Answer to a Scandalous Pamphlet</span>, and probably to Pensionary Fagel's <span class="italic">Letter</span>. This was now part of a government sponsored campaign, but Payne received little further reward. Aphra Behn dedicated a novel to him in 1688. Gilbert Burnet called Payne:<blockquote>the most active and dextrous of all King James's agents, who had indeed lost the reputation of an honest man entirely; and yet had such arts of management, that even those who knew what he was were willing to imploy him. (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 4.61)</blockquote>On the revolution he made his Fleet prison chambers a centre of Jacobite and Catholic intrigue. A raid in October 1689 revealed that he was writing the most effective Jacobite pamphlets and corresponding with many important figures.<br>
<br>Payne's greatest success was in Scottish affairs. When Sir James Montgomery, a leader of the presbyterian &#145;club&#146; parliamentary opposition, reached London in September 1689, disaffected and suspicious, Payne inserted between him and William's favourite the earl of Portland a double agent, who fermented Montgomery's suspicions that Portland was seeking to frame him on a false charge of treason, and drove him into genuine conspiracy. This brought him directly to Payne, who, &#145;so far imposed upon him as to pretend he could, with &hellip; [James] and the Court of France, dispose of money, forces and titles of honour as he pleased&#146;  (Balcarres, 51). The club and Scottish Jacobites were to restore James through parliament, with English support from both tories and whigs, which Payne would help organize. Another whig turned Jacobite, Robert Ferguson, became a close ally. Records of later interrogation reveal that the government suspected that Payne had effected a temporary escape or release from prison in order to travel to the Netherlands and encourage disaffected Dutch republicans.<br>
<br>In early 1690 Payne, who now faced prosecution for treason, did escape. Arriving in May on the Scottish borders disguised as a merchant he stayed in a house in Annandale of the earl of Annandale, Montgomery's fellow conspirator, and wrote asking both men if he should come to Edinburgh. In mid-May, however, local people, including Annandale's uninformed servants, seized him and sent him to Edinburgh, hastening the collapse of the Montgomery plot. On 4 August the council received an order to torture him and other captured agents, but initially Jacobite death threats prevented this. Annandale's confession later that month provided firm evidence against Payne, and in mid-November William again ordered rigorous torture. Its legality was dubious, since Payne was English and captured after only four days in Scotland; the interrogation was virtually all on his English activities. On 10 and 11 December 1690 he was tortured, ultimately with both the boot to one leg and thumbscrews until his life seemed in danger, without confessing anything. He begged afterwards to be exiled to the Netherlands or Germany, and the council urged William either to try him or to return him to England. William instead kept him close prisoner in Edinburgh Castle, though dysentery endangered his life, until the council in late July allowed him open prison. Jacobite propaganda in England used this as proof of William's tyrannical intentions, while Payne's steadfastness helped to discredit and prevent future use of judicial torture.<br>
<br>Somehow Payne from his cell organized a Jacobite network of agents and sympathizers (including his relative Philadelphia Wharton, widow of the lord president, Sir George Lockhart), which sent information and advice to James at St Germain, and even to the pope. During the April 1692 invasion scare an outside plot for his escape was exposed, which the government suspected to be a cover for seizing Edinburgh Castle. Payne expected death, but was merely transferred in May to Blackness Castle and in November as close prisoner to Stirling Castle.<br>
<br>In December 1692 Payne wrote to St Germain advocating a speedy invasion, and requesting James secretly to recommend Lord Stair's son for town clerk of Edinburgh. Secretary James Johnstone, head of the presbyterian faction in the government, intercepted this and exploited it to get endorsement of the presbyterians' recent gross rigging of Edinburgh burgh elections. Payne was caught drafting a reply to William King's famous propaganda book on the Irish protestants. When Johnstone's opponents in the 1693 parliament, assured by the Jacobites that Payne's letter and related intercepts were forged, imprudently challenged him, he proved them genuine, published them for members' information as <span class="italic">Nevil Payn's Letter</span>, and stampeded parliament into voting huge taxes for troops to oppose a non-existent invasion threat. On 13 May the lord advocate raised an indictment against Payne for high treason. Johnstone planned to end the session on 13 June 1693 by trying and making an example of him, since, although the letter's meaning was obvious, its use of codenames invalidated it as evidence in the regular courts. Payne secretly warned leading peers, particularly the commissioner, the duke of Hamilton, that although &#145;he would accuse none &hellip; he was resolved he would not die, and he could discover enough to deserve his pardon&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 4.212). Those not frightened for their own safety were, like Hamilton, alarmed for that of close relatives. On 15 June a majority voted to remit the prosecution to the justiciary court. &#145;In a word he owes his safety to the dimensions of his crime&#146; wrote Johnstone  (Thorp, 378).<br>
<br>On 28 June 1693 Payne was transported to close confinement in bleak Dumbarton Castle. His petitions for release, stressing his age, ill health, and ruinous debts incurred to subsist in prison, made to the council and the 1698 parliament, obtained only a transfer to Stirling Castle in July 1695, and a payment to support him from April 1696. In July 1699 he requested liberty to leave the castle for &#145;ane experiment for river navigation, whereby safer, larger and swifter vessels may be made &hellip; than any now in use&#146;  (Thorp, 379). He was allowed half a mile outside under guard. A letter mentions that the boat would go against wind and tide at a mile an hour, suggesting a primitive steamboat.<br>
<br>Finally, heeding advice that the issue of Payne's long imprisonment without trial might cause trouble in parliament and that anyway he was a liar unworthy of the government's notice, William included him in a general order for the release of prisoners which arrived on 4 February 1701. On presentation of his petition Payne was immediately discharged.<br>
<br>Payne crossed via England to St Germain, but too late. Following James II's death in September 1701 his son's established ministers soon curbed the unconventional supporters he had attracted. Within a fortnight a Quaker was in the Bastille for repeating an indiscreet, and inaccurate, remark by Payne. Payne presented a memorial to James III (James Stuart, the Old Pretender) in January 1702, urging a rising to exploit William's unique unpopularity and showing distrust of the French and Jacobite ministers, but this got him nowhere. Payne probably died at Paris in 1705.<br>
