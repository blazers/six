<span class="headword">Bond,  Denis</span>  (1588&#150;1658), <span class="occ">merchant and politician</span>, was born on 30 August 1588, the eldest son of John Bond (1556&#150;1633) of Lutton, in the Isle of Purbeck, Dorset, merchant and four times mayor of Weymouth, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1631), daughter of Richard Pitt of Weymouth. John Bond was an apprentice in France at the time of the St Bartholomew's day massacre (1572) and his son, in turn, travelled abroad in connection with the family's trading interests, journeying to St Malo in 1603 and spending the years 1605&#150;7 in Cadiz. He appears to have moved to Dorchester in 1610, when he married Joane (1588&#150;1620), daughter of John Gould, a director of the Dorchester Company; they had two sons&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2826/', "John Bond (1612&#150;1676)")</script>, MP for Melcombe Regis from 1645 and vice-chancellor of Cambridge University in 1658&#150;60, and William (<i>d</i>. 1669)&#151;and three daughters. Two years after Joane's death Bond married Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1651), daughter of William Lawrence of Winterbourne Steepleton, Dorset; they had four sons, including Samuel (MP for Poole and Melcombe Regis) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2830/', "Nathaniel Bond")</script>, lawyer and politician, and two daughters.<br>
<br>Bond set himself up as a clothier in Dorchester, becoming a large employer by 1630, and expanding through purchase his inherited property, which included the Lutton estate. Family resources may have been insufficient for him to acquire a formal education but he built up a library, largely theological, and, over the course of several years, compiled a &#145;chronology&#146; of local, national, and international events, including political events from the 1640s and 1650s, and collected genealogical information, registering a family pedigree which placed his ancestors in Somerset. He established a local political career in Dorchester, securing office as constable (1619), capital burgess (1621), bailiff (1630), lord mayor (1635), and alderman (1636), and winning the friendship of the prominent local minister and puritan colonizer John White. In 1640 he was elected a Dorchester MP in both the Short and Long parliaments, in the latter of which he served on 263 committees. He retained his local power base, sitting on the county committee for Dorset in 1643&#150;50 and being appointed a militia commissioner in 1648.<br>
<br>On the radical parliamentarian wing throughout the 1640s, Bond supported the &#145;war party&#146; drive for army reorganization in 1643. He also proved himself unremitting towards opponents of the cause, civil or religious. Along with several other MPs he ransacked the chapel of the queen's Capuchins at Somerset House in February 1643 and spoke against allowing William Laud to defend himself during the archbishop's impeachment. A member of the committee for compounding with delinquents from September 1643, he consistently opposed the granting of generous terms to parliament's opponents; in one debate in 1648 on the exception from pardon of named royalists he stated that he hoped &#145;to see the day when we may have power to hang the greatest lord of them all (if he deserves it) without trial by his peers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Pragmaticus</span>, 10&#150;17 Oct 1648). Even so, when named as a judge for the trial of Charles I he did not attend any sessions of the proceedings and did not sign the royal death warrant. Nor did he attend parliament between Pride's Purge in December 1648 and the execution of the king the following January.<br>
<br>Bond did, however, return to political activity under the Rump regime, actively participating from November 1649 as a member of the Rump's first council of state; he would be elected to all five councils of state during the Commonwealth years, and was to serve two monthly stints (1652 and 1653) as council president. He served on the council's admiralty committee from 1650 and became a recognized expert on naval affairs. In foreign policy he seems to have acted in association with Bulstrode Whitelocke: in January 1652 both men may have been involved in an attempt to secure Dunkirk for England, as well as participating in negotiations with the Dutch. In May, Bond and Cromwell were empowered to investigate the clash between the Dutch and English fleets which would prompt the First Anglo-Dutch War. The experience seems to have inclined Cromwell towards support of the war, and perhaps the same is true of Bond. Over the summer of 1652 both men were engaged with Colonel William Purefoy in discussing the possible movement of troops to Dover for coastal defence, but already it was being reported that Bond, like Cromwell, was willing to countenance moves towards peace. He also served on several parliamentary committees on law reform, though he opposed reform &#145;at critical moments&#146;  (Worden, 116), and on the Hale commission on legal reform of 1652. He was one of four commissioners appointed in December 1652 to inspect and reorganize the treasuries, retaining that post until May 1653.<br>
<br>With the fall of the Commonwealth, Bond has been seen as having &#145;apparently abandoned political ambitions and accepted the semi-sinecure office of Clerk of the Pells and Treasurer's Clerk in the Lower Exchequer&#146;  (Aylmer, 118); he already held the office of master of the Savoy Hospital, granted in 1645. He was, however, appointed to Cromwell's council for trade in July 1655, and was elected to the protectorate parliaments of 1654 (Weymouth) and 1656&#150;8 (Melcombe Regis). According to Thomas Burton's parliamentary diary, Bond made at least fifty speeches in the 1656/7 session and spoke sixty-six times in the 1657/8 session. He criticized members who absented themselves to attend to personal affairs and opposed lifetime clerical appointments. Still hostile to religious toleration, he favoured the execution of the Quaker radical James Naylor in 1656. He seems to have supported Cromwell's plans to nominate members of an upper house in 1657, and was sufficiently trusted by the lord protector to be one of the commission appointed in 1658 to tender an oath of loyalty to prospective MPs.<br>
<br>Bond died in London on 30 August 1658 just a few days before Cromwell's death, a coincidence often cited by royalists. He was buried in September at Westminster Abbey, only to have his remains exhumed in 1661, like those of other parliamentarian leaders, and removed to a common grave at St Margaret's, Westminster.<br>
