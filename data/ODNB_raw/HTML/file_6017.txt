<span class="headword">Combe,  Andrew</span>  (1797&#150;1847), <span class="occ">physician and phrenologist</span>, the fifteenth child and seventh son of George Comb, a brewer, and his wife, Marion (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Newton), was born in Edinburgh on 27 October 1797. Among his siblings was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6019/', "George Combe")</script>, the leading British proponent of phrenology. Although the family home was cramped and in an insalubrious location, George Comb was reasonably prosperous and able to employ servants. Family life was conducted according to strict Calvinistic principles. Andrew attended an elementary school on Frederick Street in Edinburgh, and then in October 1805 he entered the city's high school. In October 1810 he enrolled in &#145;the town's college&#146;, as Edinburgh University was at that time known, and spent two sessions studying Greek and Latin. While complimentary about the professor of Greek, Combe was later scathing about the quality of the Latin teaching he experienced at the university.<br>
<br>At this time Combe showed no clear inclination toward any occupation, but his father was determined that at least some of his sons would rise above the stigma of being in trade and apprenticed him to Henry Johnston, a surgeon who maintained premises on Princes Street; such an apprenticeship was a necessary first step to becoming a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. According to his brother George, Andrew showed no enthusiasm for this arrangement and on his first day had to be manhandled at least part of the way to Johnston's shop. Thereafter, however, he appears to have pursued his medical studies with diligence and some success. After attending the requisite courses of lectures given by teachers in both the extramural and the university schools of medicine, he was admitted to the College of Surgeons in 1817. Later in that year he went to Paris for further professional studies, taking the opportunity also to visit Switzerland and Lombardy. Combe was obliged to spend two winters in Italy and the south of France, owing to the first onset of the symptoms of pulmonary disease. On his return to Edinburgh, Combe began in 1823 to cultivate a practice; in 1825 he enhanced his standing by taking the degree of MD at the university and he attracted a large number of patients. He obtained a number of honorary appointments, including in 1838 that of physician-extraordinary to the queen in Scotland.<br>
<br>Together with his brother George, Andrew Combe became one of the foremost proponents of phrenology in nineteenth-century Britain. Initially both brothers, guided by the scornful rebuttals of phrenology that appeared in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, were dismissive of the new system. George's conversion occurred when Johann Caspar Spurzheim, one of the founders of phrenology, visited Edinburgh in 1815. Andrew's scepticism took longer to dispel. By his own account, &#145;it was only after witnessing the examination of many brains in the extensive hospitals of Paris, that I became convinced that the skull really represents the configuration of its enclosed brain&#146;  (A. Combe, <span class="italic">Phrenology&#151;its Nature and Uses</span>, 1846, 20). In 1820 George and Andrew Combe were among the founders of the Edinburgh Phrenological Society; and in 1823 Andrew helped to establish the <span class="italic">Phrenological Journal</span>, of which he remained a proprietor until 1837. Combe's first published article appeared in this periodical and many others were to follow. In addition, he produced a number of longer pieces expounding phrenological doctrines. Combe made ambitious claims regarding phrenology's potential for achieving social amelioration, and also maintained that it had enabled him to achieve greater self-understanding and mastery, and had helped him in his clinical practice. Moreover, according to Combe, patients themselves had come to appreciate the value of such knowledge in a physician: Combe maintained that he was much in demand as a practitioner precisely because of his phrenological expertise. Although in some quarters phrenology was associated with materialism and infidelity, Combe strenuously maintained that its precepts were altogether compatible with Christian doctrine; indeed, a phrenological understanding of human nature would enable society and the individual to practise religion more effectively.<br>
<br>From early in his career Combe showed a particular interest in mental diseases. During his time in Paris he attended the lectures of the noted alienist Jean-&Eacute;tienne-Dominique Esquirol as well as observing patients in the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re. In Edinburgh he was often consulted in cases of insanity or &#145;nervousness&#146;. Combe maintained that mental disease was the medical field in which the applications of phrenology were most obvious. He was especially concerned about the disregard that judges and juries in Britain paid to medical evidence when deciding questions of mental competence in civil and criminal cases. In <span class="italic">Observations on Mental Derangement</span> (1831) Combe maintained that mental disorder was in fact a &#145;symptom of cerebral disease&#146;, and therefore to be regarded in the same way as the diseases of any other organ.<br>
<br>In 1834 Combe published <span class="italic">The principles of physiology applied to the preservation of health, and to the improvement of physical and mental education</span>. Several portions of the work had previously appeared in the <span class="italic">Phrenological Journal</span>; its underlying philosophy was in many ways an extension of phrenological precepts and it aimed to provide a more general understanding of health and illness. Combe emphasized the individual's responsibility for his or her own well-being and the importance of attention to corporeal needs. He dismissed the notion that Christian piety demanded a disdain for the body and an exclusive concern for spiritual edification. Instead he believed that God had created &#145;organic laws&#146;, which it was the duty of each person to obey; disease was the inevitable result of a neglect of these wise regulations and the great majority of human ills could be remedied if rational measures for the preservation of health were adopted both by the individual and by society. According to one contemporary, the promulgation of these ideas represented Combe's &#145;peculiar distinction among medical writers. He burns &hellip; to bring back the bodily economy of man to its allegiance to the Supreme Guide&#146;  (Brown, 134). <span class="italic">Principles</span> was immensely popular both in Great Britain and in the United States, and went through numerous editions.<br>
<br>Combe published two health texts for a popular audience: <span class="italic">The Physiology of Digestion Considered with Relation to the Principles of Dietetics</span> (1836) and <span class="italic">The Management of Infancy, Physiological and Moral</span> (1840). This was to be his last book. His chronic pulmonary complaint grew worse, and voyages to Madeira and the United States provided only temporary relief. Combe died at Gorgie, near Edinburgh, on 9 August 1847. He did not marry and had no known progeny.<br>
