<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Strickland,  Hugh Edwin</span>  (1811&#150;1853), <span class="occ">natural historian and geologist</span>, was born on 2 March 1811 at Reighton in the East Riding of Yorkshire, the second son of Henry Eustatius Strickland (1777&#150;1865) and his wife, Mary, daughter of the inventor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4813/', "Edmund Cartwright")</script>. He was the grandson of Sir George Strickland, baronet, of Boynton, Yorkshire. At the time of his birth his father held a large farm in the neighbourhood of Reighton, but the family later moved south, to the Cotswold region. Strickland was educated at home until 1827, when he was sent to Thomas Arnold's school at Laleham, south-west of London. There he was so advanced in mathematics that a special tutor was engaged for him. He matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, in the spring of 1828, and began his studies early in 1829, taking a third-class degree in classics in 1832.<br>
<br>While an undergraduate, Strickland attended William Buckland's lectures on geology and John Kidd's lectures on anatomy. He also developed his skills as a naturalist, scrutinizing the geological features of the Vale of Evesham, where his family then lived, and of the Isle of Wight and the region around Paris, which he visited during university vacations. After he left Oxford, natural history became his main pursuit. He began to publish articles in the general areas that would continue to preoccupy him throughout his career: geological description, ornithology, and problems of classification and nomenclature.<br>
<br>Strickland was encouraged in his geological work, and introduced into the national network of &eacute;lite amateur naturalists, by Sir Roderick Murchison, with whom he became friendly at this period. Freed by his family's wealth from financial concerns, he expanded his practical experience of the natural world through travel. In 1835&#150;6 he accompanied William John Hamilton on a tour through southern Europe to Asia Minor. Back in Britain, he continued his researches both at home and on a summer journey through Scotland and Orkney in 1837. He travelled with his father, who shared his scientific and intellectual interests.<br>
<br>As Strickland was emerging as an active and prolific contributor to the community of naturalists, he made his first serious attempt to marry. But when, in 1839, he asked Sir Thomas Phillipps for permission to court his daughter, he was first asked to pay Sir Thomas's debts, as well as a large amount of cash. His father's more conventional offer of a marriage settlement of &pound;40,000 was rejected with anger and threats. It took the family and their solicitor half a year to extricate themselves. In the end, Strickland found his wife, as most of his other satisfactions, through natural history. He met Sir William Jardine, bt, at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting at Glasgow in 1840, having previously corresponded with him on ornithological topics. On 23 July 1845 he married Jardine's second daughter, Catherine Dorcas Maule, and they set out on a wedding tour to Sweden, stopping on the way to visit museums and scientists in the Netherlands and Germany.<br>
<br>The stream of articles that began in the mid-1830s continued into the 1840s. It consisted mostly of solid work in ornithology and geology: descriptions of formations or species. Strickland's most substantial work of this type was a monographic study of <span class="italic">The Dodo and its Kindred</span>, published in 1848, in which he provided the history and external description, while his co-author, A. G. Melville, analysed the anatomy. In addition, he revised and expanded the Ray Society's edition of Louis Agassiz's <span class="italic">Bibliographia zoologiae et geologiae</span>, in four volumes (1848&#150;54). At the time of his death he was working on <span class="italic">Ornithological Synonyms</span>, a compendium of scientific names for bird species. The first volume, on the Accipitres, was posthumously published in 1855, under the editorship of his widow and her father.<br>
<br>Strickland was a member of a committee appointed at the British Association meeting at Plymouth in 1841 to draft rules that would govern zoological nomenclature. He was largely responsible for its report, which, after a little acrimonious discussion, was adopted at the British Association meeting at Manchester in 1842. The proposed rules were widely praised, but had little immediate effect, either at home or abroad.<br>
<br>During the 1840s Strickland kept up his scientific ties with Oxford, and in 1850 he became deputy reader in geology at the university, filling the gap left by Buckland's deteriorating mental condition. He offered three courses of twelve to fifteen lectures: one in 1850, one in 1851, and one in 1853. His classes were small, but he took his responsibilities seriously, leading his students on field trips. In 1852 he published a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">On Geology in Relation to the Studies of the University of Oxford</span>, a contribution to the then ongoing debate over the role of natural science in the university curriculum. Apparently conceding that physical science was ultimately inferior to moral science, he felt that it nevertheless merited a prominent place in the university curriculum, because of its religious, material, and cultural benefits to students. His educational commitments also extended beyond the scholarly community. He was active in the Natural History Society of Worcester and the Tewkesbury Mechanics' Institute, and he helped to found the Cotteswold Naturalists' Field Club. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1852.<br>
<br>Strickland's death made him a martyr both to science and to progress, and attracted more attention than any of his quieter accomplishments. He had often examined the geological strata exposed by railway cuttings. On 14 September 1853, after that year's meeting of the British Association at Hull, he went to inspect a new section on the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway at Clarborough, near Retford. Because he had not waited to get a pass from the stationmaster, no one knew that he was on the line. He was working on a rock face near a sharp curve, and when he stepped backwards to avoid a coal train, he was instantly killed by a passenger train coming in the other direction. His death was widely reported and much lamented. He was buried at the priory church of St Mary, Deerhurst, Gloucestershire. His widow donated his osteological collection to the Hastings Museum at Worcester, but finding a satisfactory home for his most important collection, the approximately six thousand bird skins that he had accumulated, posed a problem. They were initially given to Oxford, to be stored safely until the new University Museum was completed. But when Mrs Strickland viewed the collection on display in 1861, she was extremely displeased, and after protracted negotiations, the collection was redonated to the University of Cambridge in 1867.<br>
