<span class="headword">Baldick,  Robert Andr&eacute; &Eacute;douard</span>  (1927&#150;1972), <span class="occ">French scholar and translator</span>, was born on 9 November 1927 at 69 Heaton Road, Paddock, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, the only son of George Sidney Baldick, schoolmaster, and his French wife, Marie Octavie Ang&eacute;la, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marielle. He was educated at Royds Hall Grammar School, Huddersfield, and Queen's College, Oxford, where he read French and German, graduating with a first in 1948. In 1952 he was awarded his DPhil for a groundbreaking thesis on the French novelist Joris-Karl Huysmans. After a brief stint as assistant lecturer at the University of Glasgow he returned to Oxford in 1953 as lecturer in French at Pembroke and University colleges. He was appointed fellow and tutor in French at Pembroke in 1958. On 29 July 1949 he married Grace Evelyn Adlam (1928&#150;2000), only child of Percy W. Adlam, municipal accountant. They had three children, (Robert) Julian, Christopher, and Hilary (Julian and Christopher became university teachers, of Islamic studies and English respectively, while Hilary worked for the BBC). They were divorced in 1967, and on 21 October the same year he married Jacqueline Anne (Jackie) Harrison, a native of Baltimore and graduate of Cornell University, with whom he had a son, Nicholas, later a political campaign strategist in the USA, and a daughter, Oriel, who became a clinical psychiatrist in Texas.<br>
<br>Known to his colleagues as Bob, Baldick specialized in vivid recreations of nineteenth-century Parisian literary and cultural life. In addition to biographies of Huysmans (1955), Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rick Lema&icirc;tre (1959), and Henry Murger (<span class="italic">The First Bohemian</span>, 1961), and anthologies of extracts from the autobiographical writings of Chateaubriand and the Goncourt brothers, he published an introduction to the Goncourts (1960) and a narrative of the siege of Paris (1964), which, like the biographies of Huysmans and Lema&icirc;tre, was translated into French. He also wrote a history of duelling (1965). His last book, <span class="italic">Dinner at Magny's</span> (1971), the French translation of which he wrote himself, is an authentic reconstruction of racy conversations between members of the celebrated 1860s dining club. Its dustwrapper depicts the bearded author plausibly seated at table in the company of Flaubert, George Sand, and others. (Joanna Richardson alleged he resembled in appearance the poet Jos&eacute;-Maria de Heredia.) The photograph was taken against the nineteenth-century French wallpaper of the senior common room of Keble College, with the portraits of Keble and Newman suitably obscured. Various colleagues, together with Jacqueline Baldick, posed for the majority of the figures, their heads subsequently replaced by the writers' own. At the time of his death, he had completed much of the research for a biography of Zola.<br>
<br>Baldick's life of Huysmans, based partly on unpublished material belonging to his friend the scholar and bookseller Pierre Lambert, was his major scholarly achievement, and fundamentally changed perceptions of a much misunderstood figure. Taken together, his books reveal his commitment to rescuing minor figures from comparative oblivion, his eye for a story, and his stylish writing. They attest furthermore to his prominence in an Oxford tradition of nineteenth-century French studies that, in the wake of Enid Starkie, not only accorded a privileged role to biography, but also encouraged a crossing of the divide between the academy and the wider world of letters. His literary judgements were those of a connoisseur, his finely judged distribution of criticism and praise resembling his assessment of the Pembroke wine cellar, of which he was the appreciative steward.<br>
<br>Bilingual from infancy, and having spent his national service translating for the RAF, Baldick produced English versions of two of Huysmans's early works before making his mark, in 1959, with an influential translation of the same author's <span class="italic">A rebours</span> (<span class="italic">Against Nature</span>). There followed accomplished renderings of works by Flaubert, Sartre, Jules Verne, and a host of other writers and scholars, both classical and contemporary. As befitted his own phenomenal productivity, he translated a number of novels by Simenon, dictating his version directly into a machine. The majority appeared under pseudonyms. Male and female pseudonyms, among them a lewd Flaubertian pun, were employed for further translations, including a streamlined version of the fifteenth-century <span class="italic">Cent nouvelles nouvelles</span>, a widely read selection of short stories, and an additional range of nineteenth-century masterpieces. As editor of the <span class="roman">Oxford Library of French Classics</span> and joint editor of <span class="roman">Penguin Classics</span> he did much to raise standards of translation and improve the status of the literary translator.<br>
<br>In addition to presenting radio talks on various nineteenth-century French subjects Baldick translated a number of plays for the BBC, several of which were later staged. Other plays translated by him, including work by new dramatists such as Georges Schehad&eacute; and Eduardo Manet, also led to stage productions. His translation of Jean-Louis Barrault's <span class="italic">Rabelais</span> was performed at the Roundhouse and in New York, and his adaptation of Camus's <span class="italic">Les justes</span> at the Mermaid. Plans for a dramatized version of <span class="italic">Dinner at Magny's</span> in collaboration with Vivian Cox were interrupted by his death, which also prevented him from seeing the television drama his close friend Terry Nation had written under the title <span class="italic">The Incredible Dr Baldick</span>; it featured an eccentric Victorian aristocrat given to investigating mysteries. He wrote regular reviews of new novels for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>. One such was devoted to <span class="italic">Last Exit to Brooklyn</span>, and he appeared as a defence witness at the obscenity trial.<br>
<br>A convivial companion and storyteller, Baldick was a flamboyant figure who skilfully adapted the mores of a nineteenth-century Frenchman to the age in which he lived. He counted among his friends Maurice Druon, the French academician, and Brian Aldiss, the science fiction writer. He was a member of the Savile Club and the Winegrowers of Ch&acirc;teauneuf du Pape, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1957. He died of a cerebral tumour at the Acland Nursing Home, Oxford, on 24 April 1972, and was survived by his wife, Jackie, and his five children.<br>
