<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Richman,  Stella</span>  (1922&#150;2002), <span class="occ">actress and television producer and executive</span>, was born at 7 Tredegar Square, Mile End, London, on 9 November 1922, the daughter of Jacob Richman, leather merchant, and his wife, Leoni, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jgelnik, both of eastern European Jewish descent. After attending Clapton County Secondary School for Girls, she went on the stage. On 2 August 1949 she married the actor&#150;manager <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32456/', "Alexander de Moro Sherriff (Alec) Clunes (1912&#150;1970)")</script>, who had started and was running the Arts Theatre Club in London's West End. There were no children of the marriage, which was dissolved in 1954.<br>
<br>Richman began her career in television by playing small parts, including three lines in the BBC series <span class="italic">The Quatermass Experiment</span>. The coming of commercial television gave her the opportunity for a new career, first as a story editor with the nascent ATV, from 1960. She immediately revealed a sure instinct for finding and nurturing young writers, many of whom were to make significant contributions to the evolving medium: among them were Alun Owen, Clive Exton, Julian Bond, Frederic Raphael, Ken Taylor, and Trevor Griffiths. Richman's need to find scripts for a weekly slot allowed her, and she her stable, a rare freedom to invent. Since they often wrote a play one week and were &#145;on the floor&#146; with it the next, her novices learned their trade with unprecedented urgency. Under the demanding but indulgent aegis of Lew Grade, Richman's &#145;boys&#146; (few females wrote television drama in the early days, though Richman was soon to be sponsoring work by Edna O'Brien and Marguerite Duras) were in at the creation of a range of material&#151;from &#145;kitchen sink&#146; to social comedy&#151;which would later be seen by some as contributing to a &#145;golden age&#146; of British television. Her progress was clinched, in 1963, by an anthology series, <span class="italic">Love Story</span>, which she produced just before joining Rediffusion Television as head of series.<br>
<br>In 1953 Richman had met Victor Brusa, who came of a family of restaurateurs and with whom she founded and ran the White Elephant Club in Curzon Street, Mayfair. As her contacts in the world of show business expanded, the White Elephant became renowned as the rendezvous of choice for emblematic figures of &#145;the swinging sixties&#146;. Richman (who was on first-name terms with many of her guests) contrived an apparent ubiquity which enabled her to combine show business with the restaurant trade and take pleasure, it seemed, in both, as well as in her daughter, Cookie, and son, Paul, with Brusa, whose name she took by deed poll. Victor Brusa's death in 1965, as the result of falling down stairs at the White Elephant, was a blow which she survived, in public, by working even harder. On 20 September 1967 she married Alec Hyams, an import company director seven years her junior, and son of Hyman Hyams, fruiterer; they divorced in 1976.<br>
<br>In the 1960s and 1970s Richman's career continued and prospered. In 1968 she initiated a new televisual form with <span class="italic">A Man of our Times</span> by Julian Bond, a series which anatomized the private and professional life of, in this case, a middle manager at a critical moment in his marriage and career. It was an elastic format which Richman used on several notable occasions, culminating in 1976 with <span class="italic">Bill Brand</span>, in which Trevor Griffiths traced the virtually <i>&agrave; clef</i> story of a left-wing Labour politician wrestling with party and conscience. In 1970 Richman had moved to London Weekend Television where she became programme controller and was the first woman to be given a seat on the board of a television company. She was, however, not happy in a largely administrative role and, in 1972, she resigned to set up an independent production company, Stella Richman Productions, with David Frost. The company (which claimed to be the first independent television production company in Britain) produced important series, of which the most memorable was <span class="italic">Jennie</span>, Julian Mitchell's account of the life of Winston Churchill's mother, Lady Randolph Churchill.<br>
<br>Throughout this time Richman continued to be a vivid and vigilant presence at the White Elephant and at the White Elephant on the River, opposite Dolphin Square, Pimlico, where Sunday brunches were spread with the generosity which was a mark of her style. After Victor Brusa's death she set up a charity in his name which provided holidays for disadvantaged children. She edited a series of cookbooks, with recipes from famous hands, as part of her fund-raising. The White Elephant Club was sold in 1988, but the charity continued to function, and more than 20,000 children had benefited from it by the time of her death.<br>
<br>Stella Richman was a small, neat woman, always feminine but never coy. Her word was her bond. She sustained remarkable success in television without making enemies or forgetting the friends who could always rely on her for clear and disinterested counsel. She was elected a fellow of the Royal Television Society in 1982. Having been an eclectic pioneer, she came to regret what she saw as the formulaic rigidity and witless content which commercial considerations later imposed on the &#145;independent&#146; network. Her Jewish origins may somewhat explain her respect for the written word. If she knew the limits of the medium and the business, and played adroitly within them, she always disdained to pander to the lowest common denominator. She remained at once modest and authoritative, spirited and feminine, until her sudden death, from emphysema and heart failure, at Hammersmith Hospital, London, on 24 May 2002. She was survived by her daughter, Cookie, and son, Paul.<br>
