<span class="headword">Hicks,  James Joseph</span>  (1837&#150;1916), <span class="occ">manufacturer of scientific instruments</span>, was born on 4 November 1837 at Ross Carbery, co. Cork, one of three children of George Hicks and Gillian Coakley. His father worked in the Coakleys' flax mill and may have held a little land, but the family was poor and James was sent to London to live with another branch of the Coakley family. In 1852 he was apprenticed to L. P. Casella of Hatton Garden, London, a philosophical glass-blower, where by 1860 he had risen to the status of foreman. This date marks also the first of many patents filed by Hicks, principally relating to meteorological and clinical thermometers, but covering other items such as barometers, hydrometers and radiometers, aneroid barometers, and various medical appliances utilizing aneroid pressure capsules. In 1862 he established his own wholesale business at 8 Hatton Garden and on 19 June married Emma Sarah Robertson, a milliner, with whom he had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>It seems likely that in 1861, in Casella's shop, Hicks had made the first clinical thermometer. In 1878, as an independent manufacturer, he acquired partial rights in Luigi Peroni's lens-front tube patent, after which his workforce swelled from about a dozen men to fifty-four employed on clinical thermometers alone, and annual sales rose to about 500 gross, of which a quarter went to the United States. In 1882, to stop infringement of his patent, Hicks went to New York to prosecute what turned out to be the biggest patent lawsuit yet contested between British and American parties. Hicks won this case, and, subsequently, others of a similar nature. By the end of his working life, he claimed to have manufactured 13 million clinical thermometers, which he supplied throughout the empire.<br>
<br>Hicks also became well known for his aneroid barometers, aimed at the large market which opened to British manufacturers when Vidi's original patent expired in 1861. He produced these in all sorts and sizes, from the popular pocket aneroids to accurate instruments which could register over a wide pressure range, for use as surveying barometers. The mountaineer Edward Whymper and Henry Watkin of the Royal Artillery collaborated with him on the improvement of high-altitude aneroids, while his reputation for precision led to his being approached by various medical men, who saw the aneroid as a means of measuring blood pressure. Under their guidance various sphygmomanometers were patented and sold on the specialist market. The firm catered to the developing science of meteorology, the growing use of industrial control instruments, and to military needs, by the provision of scientific, industrial, and domestic thermometers, barometers, and pressure gauges, and many other types of apparatus. Some, like the Crookes radiometers, were the joint product of scientific knowledge and the glass-blowing skills available in Hicks's workshops; others were aimed at new markets, for which he sometimes lacked understanding; his forays into the manufacture of aeronautical instruments, for example, were unsuccessful.<br>
<br>In 1892 Hicks expanded his manufacturing capacity by building a large factory a short distance from Hatton Garden, eventually employing some 350 men. A benevolent paternalism ruled; his men fielded cricket and football teams, and enjoyed winter social events and summer outings, joined by Hicks and his son, George, who served as his manager. To market his huge and varied output, which was always aimed at wholesale and government buyers, Hicks travelled the world, visiting the United States, South Africa, China, and Australia. He was represented at many of the international and domestic trade fairs, for example, at the annual brewery trades fairs, at Meteorological Society and Royal Geographical Society exhibitions, and at Royal Society conversaziones. He wrote, or had written on his behalf, articles in the popular and scientific press describing his new products. He was admitted a member of the Spectaclemakers' Company in 1898 and sat on its trades council, which was endeavouring to regulate the practice of ophthalmic opticians.<br>
<br>Hicks was a staunch Roman Catholic, a prominent and generous member of the church of St John the Evangelist at Islington, which served the local Irish community. In 1898 he joined other London Catholics on a pilgrimage to Rome, where he presented Pope Leo XIII with medical instruments and a gilt aneroid. In December that year the pope created him a knight of St Gregory. In 1901 he travelled again to Rome to install meteorological apparatus at the Vatican observatory, and in 1906 he presented and fitted up a similar set of apparatus at the patriarchal seminary in Venice. He gave more than &pound;1000 towards the building of Westminster Cathedral and built and endowed a church and presbytery in north London.<br>
<br>In 1911 Hicks sold his business to W. and F. Stanley of Great Turnstile, Holborn, and although he remained nominally a director until his death, his son severed all connections with the trade. Hicks's wife died in 1899; he himself died at Margate, Kent, on 24 October 1916 and was buried at St Augustine's Abbey in Ramsgate.<br>
