<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boucicault,  Dion</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Dionysius  Lardner Boursiquot]</span>  (1820&#150;1890), <span class="occ">playwright and actor</span>, was born on 27 December 1820 at 28 Middle Gardiner Street, Dublin. He was the fifth and final child of Samuel Boursiquot (1769&#150;1853) and his wife, Anne Maria (1795&#150;1879), the daughter of Arthur Darley and sister of the poet George Darley. Boucicault's natural father was probably the encyclopaedist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16068/', "Dionysius Lardner")</script>, who was lodging with the Boursiquots at the time of Dion's birth and whose relationship with Anne had alienated his own wife. Lardner certainly took charge of the boy's education after 1827, when Samuel's business failed, and evidently encouraged him to adapt his surname to Bourcicault (Boucicault dropped the &#145;r&#146; in 1845, when he found an authentic French spelling). When Lardner moved to London in 1827, prior to taking up his appointment as professor of natural philosophy and astronomy at the newly established University College, Anne Boursiquot followed him with her four youngest children. Boucicault attended a number of the small, semi-private boarding-schools that flourished during and after the Regency, but his interest was only selectively engaged. Sharing his nominal father's fanciful belief in a noble line of Boursiquots, he was a diligent student of French, and he read plentifully, but his unsystematic approach to learning survived periods at University College School (1834&#150;5), Brentford collegiate school (1836), and a final year, after the ending of Anne's liaison with Lardner, at Dr Geoghegan's academy in Dublin (1837). He was already set on a career in the theatre.<br>
<br>In April 1838, unknown to his family, Boucicault made his acting d&eacute;but at the Theatre Royal, Cheltenham, under the protective pseudonym of Lee Moreton. His meagre income, augmented until March 1840 by a quarterly allowance from Lardner, did not prevent him from dressing like a dandy, posturing like a star, and spending beyond his means. He was small and agile, with a high forehead that would become domed as his hair thinned to early baldness. Had he been less pushily self-assured, he would have made fewer enemies through his life, but he would have achieved less. Before he was twenty, Lee Moreton had cajoled provincial managers in Brighton, Bristol, and Hull into staging his apprentice work, and it was persistence that led to his first major triumph. Initially thwarted, he eventually persuaded the harassed managers of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, Madame Vestris and Charles Mathews, to buy his five-act comedy <span class="italic">London Assurance</span>. Finely staged, in something approaching an innovatory box-set, it opened to popular acclaim on 4 March 1841. The play is a necessarily bowdlerized imitation of a Restoration comedy, with flirtation replacing seduction, and, though dressed in contemporary clothes, it was, even in 1841, an adroitly crafted period piece. Boucicault now abandoned his pen-name, was elected to the Dramatic Authors' Society, and was welcomed in moderately fashionable society. Immediately, he displayed his lifelong habit of spending more than he had. Sued for debt in September 1841 and February 1842, he escaped only because he was under age when the debts were incurred.<br>
<br>Success had made Boucicault unproductive. Almost a year elapsed between <span class="italic">London Assurance</span> and the opening, on 7 February 1842, again at Covent Garden, of his next play, <span class="italic">The Irish Heiress</span>. Such inactivity was rare in a writing life of fifty years and more than 150 dramatic pieces. His long association with the actor&#150;manager Benjamin Webster, which began in April 1842, was a matter of business rather than art, a necessary reining in of poetic aspiration endorsed much later in a comment recorded by the actor J. H. Barnes: &#145;Ah! when young men get tired of writing clever plays they may write successful ones!&#146;  (Barnes, 47). Most of the pieces with which Boucicault fed Webster and himself were avowedly potboilers, though they included the skilfully turned two-act curtain-raiser <span class="italic">Used up</span> (Haymarket, 6 February 1844), which was a custom-made vehicle for the gentlemanly acting of Charles Mathews as Sir Charles Coldstream, and a competent five-act comedy, <span class="italic">Old Heads and Young Hearts</span> (Haymarket, 18 November 1844). When Boucicault bemoaned the small remuneration for playwrights, Webster pointed out that it was cheaper for him to pay people to steal plots from the Parisian stage. Needing the money, and drawn by the romance of his own purported French connections, Boucicault sailed for France in December 1844.<br>
<br>There is confusion and some deliberate obfuscation over the events of the next years. It was certainly in Paris that Boucicault met P. T. Barnum, whose eye for publicity, good or bad, he admired and would emulate. He certainly visited theatres, stole plots for shipping back to Webster, and tried to convince himself of his aristocratic descent (he briefly styled himself the Vicomte de Boucicault). It was possibly in Paris that he met the widowed Anne Guiot, whom he married in Lambeth on 9 July 1845. The daughter of Etienne St Pierre, with connections in the lesser nobility, she was older than Boucicault. Since she owned property in France, it was, unsurprisingly, rumoured that he married for her money, and, more far-fetchedly, that he soon pushed her off a glacial peak in the Alps. It is only known that she was dead by the late summer of 1848. Whatever benefits accrued to Boucicault from the marriage were soon squandered. In November 1848 he petitioned for bankruptcy. He had written nothing of note since <span class="italic">Old Heads and Young Hearts</span>. His career had to be refashioned.<br>
<br>The intervention of Charles Kean, eminent as manager of the Princess's Theatre, was decisive. Kean was conscious of the need to spice his classical repertory with modern work, and Boucicault had an appropriate pedigree. The association began in late 1850 and produced, most significantly, a five-act comedy called <span class="italic">Love in a Maze</span> (6 March 1851), a clever adaptation of <span class="italic">The Corsican Brothers</span> (24 February 1852), and a sensational rehandling of <span class="italic">The Vampire</span> (14 June 1852). The first was approved by Queen Victoria; the second established Kean's credentials in &#145;gentlemanly melodrama&#146;; the third marked Boucicault's return to acting in the sinister role of the Phantom. The title role in his last play for the Princess's, <span class="italic">The Prima Donna</span> (18 September 1852), was taken by Agnes Kelly Robertson (1833&#150;1916), who was already his lover and became his wife in New York in September 1853. The relationship caused a rupture between Boucicault and Kean, who had assumed wardship over Agnes, and the young couple resolved to try their luck in America. Boucicault divided the rest of his theatrical life between the New World and the old. Agnes's popularity in America, where she was billed as &#145;The Pocket Venus&#146;, was the foundation of their success there, but Boucicault fashioned the plays that featured her. The first of their six children, baptized Dion, was born on 10 May 1855. Agnes was acting again within a month. Boucicault had made his American d&eacute;but in November 1854, unsuitably as Coldstream in <span class="italic">Used up</span>. He was at his best only in eccentric character roles, supremely as the roguish Irishman who would be his finest creation both as actor and writer. That was a rich vein he had yet to strike when, after a failed venture into theatre management in New Orleans in 1855&#150;6, he and Agnes became members of the company at Wallack's Theatre, New York.<br>
<br>It was his part in the collaborative composition of <span class="italic">The Poor of New York</span>, which opened at Wallack's to ecstatic notices on 8 December 1857, that alerted Boucicault, not only to the capital to be made out of vividly staged sensation scenes in melodrama, but also to the marketability of contemporary events. A few months after the relief of Lucknow, <span class="italic">Jessie Brown</span> opened at Wallack's (22 February 1858), with Boucicault as the evil Nana Sahib and Agnes as Jessie. <span class="italic">Brigham Young</span> followed on 25 May 1858 and, four days after the execution of John Brown, the famous &#145;slavery&#146; play <span class="italic">The Octoroon</span> (6 December 1859). <span class="italic">The Octoroon</span> marked the end of Boucicault's third American venture into management. After quarrelling with their joint managers over salaries, the Boucicaults stormed out of the Winter Garden, where they had opened in September 1859, to join a rival New York company at Laura Keene's Theatre. It was there, on 29 March 1860, that they opened in <span class="italic">The Colleen Bawn</span>, with Boucicault outstanding as the lovable wastrel Myles-na-Coppaleen. The play is a model of melodramatic plotting; its splicing of humour and tension captivated audiences. The Boucicaults decided to test it in London, where they opened a run of 230 performances at the Adelphi on 10 September 1860. They remained in England for twelve years.<br>
<br>Boucicault's contract with Webster paved the way for the future prosperity of English playwrights, a cause to which he had been wedded since 1848. The Boucicaults jointly earned &pound;23,000 during their first London year. As always, it was spent. Boucicault bought Hereford House in the Brompton Road, hired whole companies to tour Britain with copycat productions of <span class="italic">The Colleen Bawn</span>, and, in late 1862, completed the conversion of Astley's Amphitheatre into the New Theatre Royal, Westminster. This ill-starred venture, damaged by the sudden notoriety of his liaison with the actress Emily Jordan, brought Boucicault back to bankruptcy in July 1863. A provincial tour of <span class="italic">The Poor of New York</span>, adapted and retitled for each city visited, recouped the family finances, and, in July 1864, they settled at 326 Regent Street. <span class="italic">Arrah-na-Pogue</span>, the second of Boucicault's major Irish melodramas, was warmly received in Dublin in November 1864 and again at the Princess's, where it opened on 22 March 1865. By then, all too characteristically, Boucicault had quarrelled with Webster over money, but his name was a guarantee of audience interest throughout the decade. There were London successes in 1866 (<span class="italic">The Long Strike</span> and <span class="italic">The Flying Scud</span>), 1868 (<span class="italic">After Dark</span>), and 1869 (<span class="italic">Presumptive Evidence</span>). Rumours of scandal, fanned by Boucicault, attracted audiences to <span class="italic">Formosa</span> at Drury Lane on 5 August 1869. Was its heroine based on the courtesan Mabel Gray? The secret scandal of the production was Boucicault's affair with its leading lady, Katherine Rogers. She accompanied the Boucicaults on their return to the New York stage in September 1872. The marriage survived only in name. In March 1873 Agnes returned to England, while Boucicault toured his new plays with Katherine. During the prolonged divorce proceedings, concluded in 1889, Agnes named him as the father of Katherine's child.<br>
<br>With one notable exception, Boucicault's later plays are undistinguished. <span class="italic">The Shaughraun</span>, his masterpiece, began its triumphant history at Wallack's on 14 November 1874. He bought a steam yacht on the American profits, and even persuaded Agnes to play in its London opening at Drury Lane on 4 September 1875. This last attempt at a reconciliation foundered when their eldest son, Dion, was killed in a train crash in January 1876, and there were quarrels over custody of the remaining children. In the event, four of them worked in the theatre, two, Darley George (1859&#150;1929) and Nina (1867&#150;1950), with distinction. Familiarly known as Dot, Darley adopted his father's and dead brother's name on stage [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31983/', "Boucicault, Dion, the younger")</script>]. Separated from Agnes, Boucicault continued his American tours, on which his appearance as Conn the shaughraun was almost obligatory. He was still playing the part in 1885&#150;6, when he took a small company to New Zealand and Australia. One of the group was the 21-year-old Louise Thorndyke, whom Boucicault married in Sydney on 9 September 1885. He countered charges of bigamy by denying the legality of his marriage to Agnes, thus burdening his children with the stigma of rumoured illegitimacy. Not until May 1888 did Boucicault discontinue his acting tours with Louise. Out of patience with audiences who found his new work old-fashioned, he accepted an invitation to direct an acting academy at the Madison Square Theatre, New York. But he was determined to write another successful play. During rehearsals for <span class="italic">A Tale of a Coat</span> in July 1890 he suffered a heart attack. Depressed by the play's failure in New York, he contracted pneumonia, from which, on 18 September 1890, he died. After making and losing several fortunes, the man who had once written of playwriting, &#145;It's a degrading occupation, but more money has been made out of guano than out of poetry&#146;, died poor. He was buried in Woodlawn cemetery, New York, but, on 19 November 1890, Louise had the body moved to the Mount Hope cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson. When she died in 1956 she was buried under the same stone.<br>
