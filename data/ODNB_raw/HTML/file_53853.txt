<span class="headword">Watkins,  Geoffrey Maurice</span>  (1896&#150;1981), <span class="occ">bookseller and publisher</span>, was born on 7 June 1896 at 26 Trefoil Road, Wandsworth, London, the only child of John Maurice Watkins, founder of Watkins' Bookshop, and his wife, Bertha Maude, formerly Bullock. Watkins attended Emanuel School, Wandsworth, and completed his education at Heidelberg from 1909 to 1913. The emphasis of his schooling was so European that when he was invited to tea at Max Gate, while he was stationed at Dorchester during the First World War, he had no idea who Thomas Hardy was.<br>
<br>Watkins' Bookshop had been founded in 1893 as an adjunct of the publishing house of the Theosophical Society, but by 1896 it had become independent and was settled in Cecil Court, off Charing Cross Road. In 1919 Geoffrey Watkins left the army and officially joined the firm, which was now engaged in publishing as well as bookselling, in order to provide essential support for his father, who by 1922 was totally blind. Between the wars father and son catered for readers, with books, and for the writers of the books, with tea, at the almost daily sessions of &#145;tea, talk and theosophy&#146; in the office at the back of the shop. Those who might be expected to appear included Yeats and AE (George Russell) to discuss fairies and Neoplatonism with G. R. S. Mead, A. E. Waite, and Stephen McKenna (the translator of Plotinus), and also the storytellers Algernon Blackwood, James Stephens, and Standish O'Grady, the oddities Edith Sitwell and Lady Ottoline Morrell, and the infamous Aleister Crowley; all were regular visitors.<br>
<br>Watkins was of necessity in charge of the day-to-day running of the business and oversaw both the shop and the publishing house, whose list ranged from Mead's remarkable journal <span class="italic">The Quest</span>, to Evelyn Underhill's editions of the English mystics and the first printing of C. G. Jung's <span class="italic">Septem sermones ad mortuos</span>. The shop survived the blitz and after the Second World War the breadth of vision in the firm's output was expanded to take in new works of the Gurdjieff&#150;Ouspensky school, alchemy, and the tarot, and to issue reprints of classics within its specialist field. In 1947 John Watkins died and the business came completely into Watkins's hands. Under his sole direction it continued to be a haven for seekers after &#145;rejected knowledge&#146;, although the visitors were changing; now they included Aldous Huxley, Alan Watts, and Kathleen Raine. There were also innovations. In 1953 Geoffrey issued <span class="italic">The Hermetic Museum</span>, the first of a series of important reprints of alchemical texts and studies by A. E. Waite and others which have proved to be as valuable to historians of science as to would-be alchemists.<br>
<br>But for all his publishing genius Watkins wrote very little. He contributed anonymously to Christmas Humphreys's <span class="italic">Concentration and Meditation</span> (1935) and wrote a few other slight pieces. Beyond these and his enlightened publishing programme, his real contribution to scholarship came through the guidance, encouragement, and kindness he showed to all those who struggled to bring academic acceptance to &#145;rejected knowledge&#146;. He always ensured that important books went to the right home&#151;thus Yeats's copy of Mead's <span class="italic">Orpheus</span> came to rest in the National Library of Ireland via Kathleen Raine&#151;and that students should avoid any book unsuited to their needs.<br>
<br>Watkins achieved all this without loss to his private life. Neither his wife, Flora Kate Phelps (1900&#150;1975), whom he had married in 1933, nor their son Christopher, born in 1938, was sacrificed to the business. Nor did Watkins compromise his friendships. To avoid accusations of partisanship he never allied himself to any of the movements or personalities that came and went during his lifetime; the meetings of such societies as he did join (the Buddhist Society, and the Guild of Pastoral Psychology, for example), he attended discreetly, and he continued to observe the Anglican form of his Christian faith. He could not, however, continue the business indefinitely; his son did not wish to take it up and in 1974, shortly before his wife's death, he sold both shop and publishing house.<br>
<br>In his own words Geoffrey Watkins had &#145;put forward books to do with mysticism, meditation and self-training in its very best sense&#146;  (private information). However, to others the shop was something more than a stock, at once comprehensive and carefully selected, of books on &#145;Theosophy, Christian and Oriental mystical philosophy, astrology, alchemy, and other esoteric subjects&#146;  (Watkins, &#145;Yeats&#146;, 308). It was, in the eyes of the poet Kathleen Raine, a &#145;University of Lost Knowledge&#146;  (private information), a centre in which not only the books but also the people who read and wrote them were gathered, jointly aiding the gradual academic acceptance that the study of these subjects constitutes a legitimate facet of the history of ideas. During his retirement Watkins continued to offer his advice and support to all who sought it. When he died at Kings Ride Nursing Home, Richmond, Surrey, on 15 August 1981, Watkins' Bookshop died with him: it might exist in name, but without his presence it could not live.<br>
