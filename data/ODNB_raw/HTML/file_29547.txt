<span class="headword">Williams,  Edward</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Iolo Morganwg]</span>  (1747&#150;1826), <span class="occ">Welsh-language poet and literary forger</span>, was born on 10 March 1747, at Pennon, Llancarfan, Glamorgan, the eldest of four sons of a stonemason, Edward William(s) (1715&#150;1795), and his wife, Ann Matthew(s) (1713&#150;1770). They moved, probably in 1754, to nearby Flemingston, which became Iolo Morganwg's home until his death in 1826. He received no formal education, but the family were all literate, the mother possessing a certain genteel culture, having been brought up as a poor relation of the neighbouring Seys family of Boverton. English was his mother tongue, but Welsh was the language of his literary awakening. This came from being taught Welsh verse by a local farmer, and from several key friendships, that of two neighbouring clergymen and Welsh lexicographers, Thomas Richards of Coychurch and John Walters of Llandough near Cowbridge, and of poets such as Lewis Hopkin and John Bradford. Williams followed his father's profession as monumental mason and builder, and was a wandering craftsman, in London and Kent from 1773, returning home in 1777. In London he came across a lively circle of literary figures, mostly from north Wales, especially the society of Gwyneddigion, who fired his imagination with the manuscript poems of Dafydd ap Gwilym, but also mocked him for his Glamorgan Welsh.<br>
<br>Williams had always had a great facility for Welsh versifying. He read widely, especially historical and antiquarian works, compiling lists of obsolete Welsh words, and published a long elegy for his bardic teacher Lewis Hopkin in 1772. After his return to Flemingston in 1779 he fell in love with Margaret Roberts (<i>b</i>. 1749), daughter of Rees and Eleanor Roberts of the nearby village of St Mary Church, apostrophizing her as Euron in love poems imitating those of Dafydd ap Gwilym. They were married on 18 July 1781. She was long-suffering as Williams tried farming her patrimony in Monmouthshire, or set up as a builder in Llandaff, or traded along the Bristol Channel in his own ship. Determined to escape his &#145;drudgeries&#146;, he spent his time copying ancient manuscripts and composing bogus Welsh medieval poetry. He sank deep into debt, fleeing to Cheltenham and Wells to escape his creditors, fleeing home to Wales to escape his creditors in England, and in 1786&#150;7 was in Cardiff gaol. He and his wife had in all four children, two surviving into adulthood, Margaret, born 7 July 1782, and <a href="#cosubject_29547">Taliesin [<i>see below</i>]</a>, born 9 July 1787.<br>
<br>While in prison, Williams composed a treatise on Welsh metrics (not published until 1829) to show that Glamorgan bards had never accepted the classical rules of Welsh poetry agreed in 1453. He also composed verse in English and fabricated poems so close to the style of Dafydd ap Gwilym that, when sent to the editors in London of the 1789 edition of Dafydd's works, they were inserted as an appendix and for over a century accepted as the poet's genuine poems. During the 1780s Williams became deeply interested in the ancient druids, anxious to prove to the world that not only were the Welsh bards their true successors, but that the Glamorgan bards (of which he was one of the two last survivors) alone had kept up their primeval traditions. He revealed his neo-druidic fantasy to the world in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (November 1789, 976) and then in his prefatory sketch to W. O. Pughe's <span class="italic">Heroic Elegies &hellip; of Llywarch Hen</span> (1792).<br>
<br>Williams tired of his work as a mason in 1791 and went to Bath, hoping to become an Anglo-Welsh poet, but soon moved to London, where he appears mostly to have remained until 1795, surviving on the charity of English patrons and the London Welsh, having a wide circle of friends, such as Robert Southey, the generous London Welsh currier Owen Jones (Owain Myfyr), father of the designer Owen Jones, and several political radicals favouring the French Revolution. He claimed to have taken laudanum since 1773, but during 1791 he started to take it in large quantities, moderating his cravings somewhat by the end of 1792. One aspect of his activities at this time was his pamphleteering, publicizing the myth that America had been discovered by the twelfth-century Welsh prince Madoc, with the aim of mounting expeditions to contact his followers' descendants, perhaps surviving in the American mid-west.<br>
<br>More remarkable was Williams's invention of the Gorsedd of Bards of the Isle of Britain, of which the first meeting was held under his aegis on 21 June 1792 at Primrose Hill, London. The place was suggested by meetings of the Ancient Druid Order, founded early in that century, but the gorsedd was an entirely separate association for supporters of all things Welsh, its rites and rituals, however, invented by Williams, who now became universally known by his bardic name of Iolo Morganwg (Edward of Glamorgan). Several druidic meetings were organized, but the gorsedd was not connected to the revived eisteddfod until the latter's meetings at Carmarthen in 1819.<br>
<br>In 1794 Williams published a two-volume collection of his English verse, which appeared as <span class="italic">Poems Lyrical and Pastoral</span> and which airs a number of his myths and inventions, such as neo-druidism. The plight and near starvation of his young family, however, called him home to Flemingston in 1795, where he again tried his hand at masonry, though for some years in the later 1790s he moved into the nearby market town of Cowbridge to keep a shop, supplementing his income by copying out Welsh manuscripts for Owen Jones (Owain Myfyr) and writing reports on south Wales agriculture for government surveyors. He joined Owen Jones and William Owen Pughe as editors of the first printed corpus of Welsh medieval literature, <span class="italic">The Myvyrian Archaiology</span> (3 vols., 1801&#150;7), but the third volume contains much that is fabricated by Williams.<br>
<br>About 1797 Williams became interested in Unitarianism, becoming one of the founders of the South Wales Unitarian Society in 1802 and the author of its book of regulations in 1803 and of large numbers of hymns published in 1812. From 1807 to 1813 Williams ran his business at the neighbouring village of Gileston, working into the mid-1820s, spending his last years in his cottage at Flemingston, surrounded by a vast collection of genuine and fabricated Welsh manuscripts, concocting materials on Glamorgan history and texts of lore and rites and rituals for his druid bards. He died at Flemingston on 18 December 1826 and was buried in the churchyard. A monument was erected to him inside the church in 1858, while in 1926 another was placed in the main street of Cowbridge on the wall of his former shop. His son edited some of his father's manuscripts: <span class="italic">Cyfrinach y beirdd</span> (1829), <span class="italic">Coelbren y beirdd</span> (1840), and the <span class="italic">Iolo Manuscripts</span> (1848), while his follower John Williams (pseudonym Ab Ithel) later published two further volumes of bardic lore from the manuscripts removed from Flemingston to Llanover Court.<br>
<br>Although several contemporary Welsh scholars expressed doubts about Edward Williams's neo-druidism, for the most part he was admired for publicizing the Gorsedd of Bards and for staunchly radical and dissenting beliefs. At the end of the century a new generation of University of Wales academics began to analyse all aspects of his work, his manuscripts being donated to the National Library of Wales in 1916. Soon after this Griffith John Williams began his lifetime study of Williams, coming to the conclusion that, although a pioneering Romantic poet in Welsh, and the most talented writer of the eighteenth-century Welsh cultural renaissance, he had forged a vast quantity of Welsh historical material, that the poems of the appendix to the 1789 edition of Dafydd ap Gwilym were forgeries, and that the Gorsedd of Bards was his invention. His mind was affected by a lifelong addiction to laudanum, but he strove to show that Glamorgan had had a more brilliant historical and literary past than was justified by genuine evidence, that Wales itself was the most interesting part of Britain, and that bards were the true guardians of national tradition.<br>
<br>Iolo's son <a name="cosubject_29547"></a><span class="headword">Taliesin Williams</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Taliesin ab Iolo]</span>  (1787&#150;1847)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 7 July 1787 at Cardiff (according to one tradition in Cardiff gaol), and baptized at Flemingston church on 16 September of that year. He was educated at Cowbridge, and became a partner in his father's business. He left in 1813 to train as a schoolmaster with the Unitarian David Davis at Neath, and in 1816 set up a successful school in Merthyr Tudful. He married Mary Petherick, and they had at least one son, Edward Williams (1826&#150;1888). Taliesin Williams shared his father's radical politics, and druidic beliefs, apparently unaware of his father's forgeries and inventions, and edited a quantity of his father's manuscripts. He died at Merthyr on 16 February 1847 but was buried at Flemingston.<br>
