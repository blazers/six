<span class="headword">Harris,  Emanuel Vincent</span>  (1876&#150;1971), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 26 June 1876 at 3 Lambert Street, Devonport, Devon, the son of Major Emanuel Harris and Mary Vincent. He was educated at Kingsbridge grammar school and in 1893 was articled to James Harvey, architect, of Plymouth. Harris then moved to London to study at the Royal Academy Schools while working in several offices. He was first with E. Keynes Purchase, then with Leonard Stokes, and finally with Sir William Emerson for three years before joining the architect's department of the London county council, which was then erecting the buildings connected with its electric tram system. Harris was assistant architect for the generating station at Greenwich and designed several transformer stations which were also characterized by the use of an austere and monumental neo-classical style in yellow brick. The station in Upper Street, Islington, was evidently inspired by Newgate prison, the masterpiece of George Dance junior, which was demolished in 1902.<br>
<br>Harris was awarded the gold medal and travelling studentship at the Royal Academy Schools in 1903 and the following year set up in practice. He was placed sixth in the competition for the Wesleyan Methodist hall in London and second in that for Torquay town hall before winning the competition for the Glamorgan county hall in Cardiff in 1908 in partnership with Thomas Anderson Moodie (1875&#150;1948), who had spent the preceding five years as architect to the Central South African Railway. The executed design &#145;achieved the Roman scale he was to maintain in his work throughout his life&#146;  (Stuart Gray), and this success launched Harris on his uniquely successful and prolific career as an architect of public buildings reflecting the contemporary taste for the grand manner as an expression of civic pride and expansion. It was a career described by C. H. Reilly as &#145;a series of raids all over England, and mostly carried out single handed. No one of his age &hellip; has tackled so many competitions, and at the same time been placed in so many&#146;  (Reilly, 393). In 1914 Harris won that for the new offices of the Board of Trade in London, although two world wars were to pass before his much simplified version of &#145;the Whitehall Monster&#146;  (Summerson, 424) was completed on the site in 1959 for the Ministry of Defence.<br>
<br>After the First World War, E. Vincent Harris (as he was known) won a series of open competitions for public buildings owing to his firm grasp of planning combined with his assured handling of a monumental classical language. These included Sheffield city hall (1920&#150;34), Braintree town hall (1926&#150;8), Leeds civic hall (1930&#150;33), Somerset county hall at Taunton (1936), and Nottingham county hall (1937&#150;46). In 1927 Harris won two separate competitions for two important adjacent buildings in Manchester, and while the circular central library is classical, the town hall extension is in a subtle hybrid style which respects the vigorous Gothic of Alfred Waterhouse's Victorian pile. Other departures from the pure classic included Messrs Atkinson's premises in Bond Street, London, and some of the buildings in an abstracted Tudor manner (designed with Sidney K. Greenslade) for the University College of the South West (later Exeter University), for which he had prepared a master plan in 1931.<br>
<br>For Sheffield, Harris looked to H. L. Elmes's St George's Hall in Liverpool for inspiration, while in Leeds there are echoes of Wren, but his later civic buildings were designed in a simpler Georgian manner in brick, influenced by the work of Sir Edwin Lutyens. The long, curved council house at Bristol was designed in 1935 but not completed until after the Second World War. The Kensington Central Library (1955&#150;60) was designed when the architect was almost eighty years of age and was the object of one of several public demonstrations against such conservative traditional architecture, organized by a pressure group calling themselves the Anti-Uglies.<br>
<br>Harris did not only handle public buildings; he designed a church at Stewartby, Bedfordshire, and his versatility was demonstrated by the screen wall and racquets court in Carlos Place, London (1924), shielding the courtyard of 47 Grosvenor Place for Stephen Courtauld. Harris considered his best building to be 2&#150;3 Duke Street, St James's (1910&#150;12). His own house in Fitzroy Park, Highgate, of 1932&#150;4 (which he gave to the London borough of Camden when he retired to Chard, Somerset) was largely designed by Donald McMorran, one of several talented architects who assisted him in his busiest years. Others included E. Berry Webber, who went on to design Southampton civic centre and Hammersmith and Dagenham town halls, and Arthur Bailey.<br>
<br>Short in stature and taciturn, Harris was respected rather than liked. He wrote to McMorran in 1942 that &#145;we both know there is only one thing that really matters and that is &#147;the work&#148;. All the rest is vanity though it does sweeten labour&#146;  (private information). Arthur Bailey recalled that<blockquote>This man was completely dedicated to classical architecture to the exclusion of all other interests and he expected and received the same approach from his staff, not only quality of work, but an austerity which would not be acceptable today; no smoking, no tea or extended public holidays, the whole office closing for the summer recess &hellip; He had no time for letters, meetings or officialdom. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 Aug 1971)</blockquote>Harris was very conscientious; in 1929 Reilly noted that, &#145;as an indication of the pains he takes with his actual buildings when he has won them, there is the fact that he has been three times to America, each time to study some particular type he was about to build&#146;  (Reilly, 393).<br>
<br>Harris was awarded the royal gold medal for architecture in 1951. He was elected FRIBA in 1914 and RA in 1942, and later served as treasurer of the Royal Academy; he was appointed OBE in 1950 and was awarded an honorary DLitt. by the University of Exeter. In 1913 he married Edith Maule, the daughter of William Maule MD of Southport; she died in 1965 and there were no children. Harris died at the Cranhill Nursing Home, Weston Road, Weston, Bath on 1 August 1971 and was buried in the churchyard of St Michael and All Angels at Chaffcombe, near Chard, under a stone designed by Arthur Bailey. The RIBA holds some of Harris's drawings, presented to them in 1967.<br>
