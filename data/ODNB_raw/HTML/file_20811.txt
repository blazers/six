<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Powlett,  Thomas  Orde-</span>, first Baron Bolton  (1746&#150;1807), <span class="occ">politician</span>, the elder son of John Orde (<i>d</i>. 1784), a landowner, of East Orde and Morpeth, Northumberland, and his second wife, Anne Marr (<i>d</i>. 1788) of Morpeth, was born on 30 August 1746 at Morpeth, where he was baptized Thomas Orde on 2 October. He was descended from a prominent Northumbrian family&#151;his great-uncle William represented Berwick upon Tweed between 1713 and 1715&#151;and he had a half-brother, William, from his father's first marriage, to Mary Ward, and a younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20810/', "John Orde")</script>, who became first baronet. He was educated at Eton College from 1755 until he went up in 1765 to King's College, Cambridge, where he was made a fellow in 1768 and graduated BA in 1770 and MA in 1773. A competent artist, he became known for his etched caricatures of local celebrities in Cambridge; these were published by his drawing-master, James Bretherton. Having been admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1769, he was called to the bar in 1775. In the intervening years he travelled in France, Switzerland, and Italy (1772&#150;3) and Flanders, the Netherlands, and Germany (1774). On 7 April 1778 he married Jean Mary Browne Powlett (<i>d</i>. 1814), the natural daughter of Charles Powlett, fifth duke of Bolton, and Mary Browne Banks, on whom the greater part of the Bolton estates was entailed.<br>
<br>The holder of a succession of offices in the duchy of Lancaster from 1772, which he owed to the patronage of Lord Hyde, later earl of Clarendon, who was a personal friend, Orde also owed his entry to parliament to the influence of powerful patrons. He was elected to represent the borough of Aylesbury in 1780 on the nomination of the earl of Chesterfield, to whom he had been recommended by John Robinson. Robinson allocated a substantial sum of secret service money to defray the cost of his election to this &#145;venal and expensive borough&#146;  (Namier, 232). Though a reluctant parliamentary performer, Orde was a loyal and not inactive supporter of Lord North's ministry in its final years. He seconded the address on 27 November 1781 defending the government's American policy, but his major contribution was made in the secret committee established on 2 May 1781 to investigate the causes of the war in the Carnatic. Although this was chaired by Henry Dundas and included Charles Jenkinson among its membership, Orde &#145;took over the detailed work of the committee&#146;  (ibid., 233). It was a task for which he was eminently suited, as Nathaniel Wraxall noted when he observed of the fifth report of the committee, which was attributed to Orde, that it was &#145;one of the most able, well-digested, and important documents ever laid upon the table of the House of Commons&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical and Posthumous Memoirs</span>, 2.108). Publicly complimented for his efforts by Dundas, Orde was made under-secretary to Lord Shelburne at the Home Office on the creation of the short-lived Rockingham ministry, and on the formation of a new ministry under Shelburne in July 1782 he was promoted to the position of secretary to the Treasury. Orde and Shelburne established a close attachment arising out of their period in office together, so much so that, when William Pitt came to form a new ministry on the dismissal of the Fox&#150;North coalition in December 1783, Orde declined Pitt's request that he should resume his place at the Treasury. A number of other offers and requests for help at this time merely underlines the point that he was identified in the corridors of power as a man of ability. In spite of his expectation that he would soon be without a seat in the House of Commons should a general election be called&#151;he could not sustain an expensive election contest at Aylesbury out of his own resources without government backing&#151;he declined every invitation until the newly appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland, the duke of Rutland, approached him through Shelburne with the request that he should become his chief secretary. This assured him of the support he required, and he was returned for the Treasury borough of Harwich in the general election of 1784.<br>
<br>Orde accompanied Rutland to Ireland in February 1784. On the face of it, they were an unlikely combination. Rutland was better known for his prodigal lifestyle than for his political skill, but his style, convivial disposition, and lack of interest in the daily grind of administration well complemented Orde's strengths. As Irish chief secretary Orde was particularly attentive to the detail of business, and though he demonstrated a perturbing readiness to indulge in self-pity when things got difficult it never eclipsed his strong commitment to duty. Where hard work and application were sufficient, he ensured that the work of government was conducted efficiently. His judgement of men and measures was less secure; he was prone to lose perspective when the matter at issue was complex and contested, and his lack of social grace ensured that he was never very good at the task of man management, which was an essential part of the work of an Irish chief secretary. These limitations became apparent only with time. In the short term Orde worked well with the conservative men of business that Rutland's predecessor, Lord Northington, had introduced into the Irish executive.<br>
<br>The greatest challenge the new administration faced in 1784 was to deflect the demand for a reform of the representative system that was promoted by a loose coalition of patriot parliamentarians and middle-class radicals. In common with his colleagues on the Irish administration, Orde believed that any liberalization of the representative system must exacerbate the task of maintaining English control in Ireland, so when the rejection by the Irish parliament in the late spring of popular measures for the reform of parliament and for protecting duties prompted a prolonged bout of public disorder, he was easily convinced that its purpose was &#145;to weaken the government and to sever the bonds of union between the two countries&#146;  (Bolton MS 16355, fols. 1&#150;4). Indeed, Orde was so persuaded by evidence gleaned from intercepted correspondence and spy reports that there was a conspiracy afoot involving &#145;connections and confederacies&#146;  (ibid., fols. 10&#150;12) of Roman Catholics, Presbyterians, and the French crown that, when Pitt contemplated responding with a plan of reform that would provide for the increased admission of protestants to the political process, he categorically condemned the suggestion as inappropriate and counter-productive. &#145;The measure could not succeed here without the most extreme hazard, not the administration merely, but the British government in the kingdom&#146;, he pronounced at the outset of an exhaustive 27-page rebuttal  (Chatham MS 30/8/329, fols. 145&#150;59). Orde's disposition to indulge in self-pity under pressure was first manifested at this point. Distressed by the death of his father and harassed by his inability to get to the root of the disorder that continued to disturb the streets of Dublin, he confided to Henry Dundas that &#145;never was a man placed in a situation which he more cordially detested, or where he makes a more complete sacrifice of his feelings, his habits and comforts&#146;  (Melville MS 54, fol. 25). However, he vowed &#145;to endure all rather than to risk my character &hellip; or &hellip; the success of the King's government&#146;  (ibid.), and before the year was out he had the satisfaction of witnessing the return of order to the city streets and the virtual disintegration of the parliamentary reform movement.<br>
<br>Because, as chief secretary, he was the key link in the chain that bound the British and Irish executives, Orde enjoyed little respite from the pressures of high office. Arising out of his conviction that the Anglo-Irish relationship had been left dangerously undefined as a result of the concession of legislative independence in 1782, William Pitt's determination to bind Britain and Ireland in a commercial union demanded the total engagement of the Irish chief secretary in its elaboration and presentation. It was Orde who provided the prime minister with &#145;a short state of the case&#146; upon the commercial points around which Pitt devised his initial outline of a settlement. Subsequently he unsuccessfully advised the prime minister against including a provision for an annual financial payment from the Irish to the British exchequer. As Orde forecast, this proved the sticking point with the Irish parliament when on 7 February 1785 he presented the scheme in the form of ten propositions &#145;in a most correct and masterly manner&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 3.175). Determined that it should not fail at the first hurdle, Orde agreed to the inclusion of an additional proposition to ease Irish anxieties, but the perception in Britain that this put an Irish financial contribution at risk was a serious complication. It little impressed ministers that the modified propositions were warmly endorsed by the Irish parliament. Pitt insisted that a formula was devised that secured a contribution from Ireland. Orde was so deflated by this and by criticism of the amended propositions that he contemplated resignation. There was no question of his resignation being sought or accepted, but the resulting tortuous efforts to devise an acceptable strategy to ensure a secure financial contribution from Ireland, which necessitated his departure for London in March, in an &#145;unpleasant hurry&#146;  (Bolton MS 16352, fol. 9), proved difficult and distressing.<br>
<br>Obliged to represent the English case in Ireland and the Irish case in England, Orde felt he was engaged, he explained to Pitt, &#145;in a perpetual scene of warfare both on the one side and on the other&#146;  (Bolton MS 16358, fols. 93&#150;6). Matters became even more difficult following Pitt's decision to respond to pressure at home by recasting and expanding the propositions to take account of wider imperial and domestic vested interests. Orde attended to the myriad issues that arose out of this with scrupulous care, but he continued to find this task and that of endeavouring to keep political interests in Ireland on side extremely trying: &#145;My brain is almost unsettled by the endless conversations and explanations which I am obliged to endure&#146;  (ibid., fols. 119&#150;20), he conceded to George Rose on 3 June. Despite this, and occasional bouts of debilitating illness that necessitated recourse to an amanuensis, a broadly acceptable bill for a commercial settlement was finally drafted in the late summer, and Orde was ready to present it to the Irish parliament on 12 August. The task that faced him that day would have tested even the most expert of parliamentarians, and Orde failed to rise to the occasion. According to &#145;Memory&#146; Woodfall, who was present to record the debate, the chief secretary was &#145;so far unintelligible that, had I not known the business practically before, I could not have conceived its true tendency&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal and Correspondence of &hellip; Auckland</span>, 1.79). Irish dislike of the proposal rather than Orde's poor performance ensured that the measure did not advance beyond first reading stage. None the less, the chief secretary's limitations in the Commons and inattention to man management reinforced the perception that he was not possessed of the qualities necessary in an Irish chief secretary. Arising out of this, Pitt suggested to the duke of Rutland late in 1785 that he might wish to replace Orde, but the lord lieutenant's stout defence of his beleaguered chief secretary ensured his survival, and Pitt signalled his support by nominating him to the British privy council shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>Encouraged by their experiences in 1785, the Irish administration &#145;attempted nothing out of the common course&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 3.264) during the 1786 parliamentary session. The commercial arrangement was quietly shelved, and Orde overcame his increasing susceptibility to illness to oversee the ratification of a measure that provided for the introduction of a government-controlled police force for Dublin city. He had become convinced of the necessity for such a body by the disorder that gripped the city in 1784, and his identification and implementation of this pioneering experiment in policing, in the teeth of strong opposition, emphasized his skills and capabilities as an administrator. He demonstrated this further by developing a suggestion made to him by the earl of Shelburne that he should reform Irish education. Persuaded by his own observations, as well as by reports of the serious failings of existing institutions, that an enhanced educational system would serve both to dispel &#145;the mists of ignorance&#146;  (Giffard, 29) and to attach Catholics to the state, he presented the Irish parliament on 12 April 1787 with a plan for a five-tier educational system encompassing parish, provincial, diocesan, and collegiate schools and two universities. Orde conceded that it was not possible &#145;to accomplish the whole system at once&#146;  (Bolton MS 16360, fol. 1). Considerable efforts were made to overcome the opposition of vested interests during the summer of 1787 and to secure funding, but Orde's own capacity to engage with the subject was restricted by illness. His departure from Ireland was assured even before the death of the duke of Rutland in October brought down the curtain on the Rutland administration and on Orde's eventful and significant chief secretaryship.<br>
<br>Orde left Ireland with a pension of &pound;1200. Ill health and his own political limitations ensured he never again held major office; while he continued to act as MP for Harwich in the government interest until 1796, he rarely contributed to debates. He was appointed governor of the Isle of Wight in succession to his father-in-law in 1791, and the Bolton estates passed to him in right of his wife on the death of the sixth duke of Bolton on 24 December 1794. On 7 January 1795 he took the additional name of Powlett, and on 20 October 1797 he was created Baron Bolton of Bolton Castle, Yorkshire. His last appointment was to the lord lieutenancy of Hampshire in 1800. He died on 30 July 1807 at his home, Hackwood Park, near Basingstoke, some seven years before his wife (who died on 14 December 1814) and was buried on 8 August 1807 at Old Basing, Hampshire. He was succeeded by William Powlett Orde (1782&#150;1850), the elder of his two sons.<br>
