<span class="headword">Moshoeshoe II</span>  (1938&#150;1996), <span class="occ">king of Lesotho</span>, was born on 2 May 1938 at Thabang, Mokhotlong district, Basutoland, the son of Sebueng, a commoner who was the second wife of Simon Seeiso Griffith (1905&#150;1940), briefly paramount chief of Basutoland from 1939 to 1940. At his birth he was given the name Bereng Constantine Seeiso. His father's death at an early age was unexpected. According to the Basotho rule of royal succession Bereng should have eventually succeeded his father as paramount chief because he was the first-born son of Seeiso's highest ranking wife. This was complicated, however, by the fact that Seeiso's first wife, 'Mantsebo Amelia 'Matsaba Sempe (1902&#150;1964), who served as queen regent and acting paramount chief until Bereng came of age in 1959, was extremely hostile to Sebueng because she was a commoner and came from another ethnic group, the Batlokoa, rather than the Basotho. The regent favoured Leshoboro, who was three years older than Bereng, and the son of Seeiso's third wife, maLeshoboro.<br>
<br>Because Sebueng believed that members of the royal family, including 'Mantsebo, might try to kill Bereng or prevent him from taking the throne, she went to great lengths to protect him. She sent him away from Matsieng, the royal capital, to be raised in the homes of sympathetic chiefs: Chief Kethisa Tau in Pitseng, Chief Gabashane Masopha in Berea, and Chief Matlere Lerotholi in Mokhotlong. As a boy he was first taught by private tutors, but when the decision was made to send him to school, the regent 'Mantsebo ignored the wishes of his mother that he be sent to a protestant school and instead placed him in Catholic schools: first a primary school at Mokhotlong and then a higher primary and secondary school at Roma, south-east of Maseru.<br>
<br>Bereng's first visit to England was in 1953, when he travelled with one of his uncles to attend the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The following year his mother, still fearing the regent might try to poison him, sent him to England for further schooling. He attended the Benedictine school at Ampleforth from 1954 to 1956 and then read philosophy, politics, and economics at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, from 1956 to 1959, when he was called home to become paramount chief. Despite the opposition of the regent and one of her principal advisers, Chief Leabua Jonathan, senior chiefs deliberated and overwhelmingly supported Bereng's claim to the throne.<br>
<br>Basutoland was still under British rule, so Bereng was installed on 12 March 1960 as paramount chief rather than as king. The date had significance because the British had placed Basutoland under its protection on 12 March 1868. Bereng took the name Moshoeshoe after his great-grandfather, who was largely responsible for creating the Basotho kingdom in the early nineteenth century. He was made king when Lesotho became an independent nation in October 1966. Meanwhile, on 23 August 1962 he married Tabitha 'Masentle (1941&#150;2003), daughter of Chief Thabo Lerotholi Mojela. She was popularly known as Queen 'Mamohato after their marriage. They had two sons, David Mohato Bereng Seeiso (<i>b</i>. 1963) and Seeiso Bereng Seeiso (<i>b</i>. 1966), and a daughter, Constance Christina 'Maseeiso (1969&#150;1994).<br>
<br>During the colonial period Moshoeshoe had limited authority because the 1959 constitution ceded power to other chiefs and civilians in a national council. Most civilian politicians were not prepared to grant the paramount chief any more than ceremonial functions. After independence Lesotho's constitution provided for a constitutional monarch who was expected to refrain from direct involvement in politics. Frustrated by his limited role, Moshoeshoe publicly criticized his status and advocated holding a national referendum for the citizens of Lesotho to vote on his powers. His monarchy was also defined by the continuing rivalry between the Letsies and the Molapos, two royal houses descended from Moshoeshoe I. In the post-independence period Moshoeshoe II, who headed the senior house, the Letsies, had a poor relationship with Lesotho's first prime minister, Leabua Jonathan, a low-ranking chief who represented one of the junior houses, the Molapos.<br>
<br>Moshoeshoe and Jonathan clashed just a few months after independence when the king called for a prayer meeting of his followers on 27 December 1966 at Thaba Bosiu, the mountain that had been Moshoeshoe I's royal capital. Jonathan, believing that the monarch was going to use the occasion to make a political statement and mobilize his supporters, sent a police force that fired shots at the gathering, killing about ten people. Moshoeshoe was not hurt, but the government placed him under detention at his palace. In early 1967 the government pressed him into signing an agreement that he would strictly adhere to the constitution. His next major confrontation with Jonathan came after Lesotho's first post-independence elections in January 1970. As votes were being counted and it became apparent that Jonathan's Basotho National Party was losing the election to the main opposition party, the Basotholand Congress Party, Jonathan declared the result null and void and jailed many of his opponents. In April 1970 he banished Moshoeshoe to the Netherlands, where he was looked after by the Dutch royal family. He was only allowed to return to Lesotho in December 1970 after agreeing not to engage directly in politics either as an individual or in co-operation with any political party. He held little more than ceremonial functions for the rest of Jonathan's rule.<br>
<br>Moshoeshoe's status significantly changed when Jonathan was toppled by a military coup in January 1986. <span class="roman">Lesotho order no. 2</span> (1986) delegated executive and legislative powers to the king in consultation with a six-person military council headed by Major-General Justin Lekhanya. Moshoeshoe was comfortable with this relationship because he opposed a return to civilian rule. Although the monarch and military worked well initially, however, the relationship eventually soured because of the competition between royal and commoner military officers. After several royal officers were implicated in the killing of several former cabinet ministers, Lekhanya directed the king to replace four colonels, including two of his close relatives, on the military council. When Moshoeshoe refused, the military council stripped him of his executive powers and forced him into exile in Britain, on 10 March 1990. Faced with the dilemma of replacing a sitting monarch, senior chiefs prevailed on his elder son, David Mohato, to replace him. Taking the name Letsie III, he took the oath of office as king on 12 November 1990. From exile Moshoeshoe continued to criticize the military council and political developments in Lesotho.<br>
<br>The removal of Moshoeshoe did not ease the tensions within the military. In April 1991 Lekhanya was himself overthrown by junior military officers who began preparing the country for a return to civilian rule with a constitutional monarch in elections in March 1993. Although the Basotho Congress Party won a sweeping victory and its leader Ntsu Mokhehle was chosen as prime minister, Letsie and military officers overthrew him in a coup in August 1994. After mediation by the Southern African Development Community and in particular Nelson Mandela, the newly elected president of South Africa, and with Letsie's agreement, Moshoeshoe returned to Lesotho and resumed his throne in early 1995, and Mokhehle's government was restored.<br>
<br>On 15 January 1996 Moshoeshoe died in an accident when his driver fell asleep at the wheel and their car crashed down a mountain ravine. His grave is in the royal cemetery on top of Thaba Bosiu, where all the other kings of Lesotho, including Moshoeshoe I, are buried. His funeral was attended by Frederick Chiluba, Quett Masire, Robert Mugabe, and Nelson Mandela, the presidents of Zambia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa, respectively. He was survived by his wife and two sons, the elder, Letsie, again becoming king.<br>
