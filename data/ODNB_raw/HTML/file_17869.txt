<span class="headword">Malcome,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1656&#150;1729), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian General Synod of Ulster</span>, matriculated from Glasgow University in 1672 as &#145;Joannes Malcolmus, Hybernus&#146; and so was probably born in Ireland; he graduated MA in 1674. In December 1686 the Presbyterian congregation of Killead, co. Antrim, was divided into upper and lower; Malcome was called to Lower Killead in June 1687 and ordained there on 5 December. In 1699 he was transferred to Dunmurry, in the same county, where an old malt kiln was used as a meeting-house.<br>
<br>In 1703 the Presbyterian clergy was divided on the question of the oath of abjuration. Malcome strongly favoured taking the oath and attacked a neighbouring minister, Alexander McCracken (<i>d</i>. 1730), who, though a staunch Hanoverian, had preached against the oath as sinful and had retreated to Scotland to avoid it. The affair came before the General Synod of Ulster in June 1704, when Malcome was rebuked and McCracken admonished.<br>
<br>In 1720 the nonsubscription controversy broke out in Belfast in connection with the installation of Samuel Haliday. Malcome was a staunch subscriber and was the first to launch into print with an attack on the nonsubscribers. His <span class="italic">Personal Persuasion No Foundation for Religious Obedience</span> (1720) was an answer to John Abernethy's published sermon <span class="italic">Religious Obedience</span> (1720). Although Malcome was not the originator of the phrase he was the first to use in print the term &#145;new light&#146; about the nonsubscribers. His opposition to them was based on a belief that they were undermining the authority of the church courts rather than on any theological grounds. His argument was that &#145;a set of men, by preaching and printing, pretend to give new light to the world, by putting personal persuasion in the room of church government and discipline&#146;  (Witherow, 218&#150;19).<br>
<br>An anonymous pamphlet, <span class="italic">More Light, being some Remarks on the Late Vindication</span> (1722), an answer to a work by James Kirkpatrick published in 1721, is often ascribed to Malcome. His final published pamphlet was <span class="italic">The dangerous principles of the sectarians of the last age, revived again by our modern new lights</span> (1726), which brought forth a response from Abernethy in the same year. Malcome died at Dunmurry on 17 May 1729 and was buried there, in the graveyard of the meeting-house, on 20 May. The location of his grave is now lost.<br>
