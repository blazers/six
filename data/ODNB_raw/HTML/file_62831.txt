<span class="headword">Maw,  John Hornby</span>  (1800&#150;1885), <span class="occ">entrepreneur and artist</span>, was born on 12 April 1800 at Ferry, in Lincolnshire, the eldest of four children of George Maw (1770&#150;1834), a local farmer, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hornby (1769&#150;1828). His parents married in 1799. In 1807 they and their (then) three children moved from Lincolnshire to London, and George Maw established a wholesale druggist business with his wife's cousin named Hornby. In 1814 he parted from Hornby and set up a pharmaceutical manufacturing business by purchasing a surgical plaster factory. Other sundries were soon added, including surgeons' instruments.<br>
<br>John Maw received schooling at Aspley Guise, Bedfordshire, and at Merchant Taylors' School, London. His father placed him, at fifteen, with a chemist at Croydon for two years and afterwards entered him at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, in order to gain first-hand knowledge that might benefit the family business. In 1826 he was taken into partnership with the family firm. In the same year he married Mary Anne Johnson (1795&#150;1853). He and his younger brother Solomon married sisters, the only daughters of John Johnson of Maiden Lane, assayer to the Royal Mint and to the Bank of England. His brother-in-law Percival N. Johnson founded the famous firm of Johnson Matthey, in Hatton Garden, London.<br>
<br>The family business prospered and in the early 1830s provided a secure financial basis for Maw to begin to indulge in the collection of paintings. His three children were born at this time: Anne Mary (1830), George (1832), and Arthur (1835). In 1835 he retired from the business for health reasons but its considerable commercial success continued throughout the nineteenth century under his brother Solomon and nephew Charles.<br>
<br>In 1839 Maw and his family moved to Hastings, Sussex, where they lived at West Hill House. There his friends included many well-known artists, such as William Hunt, David Cox, and J. M. W. Turner. He took lessons from Peter DeWint and fitted up a studio at his home. He was a member of the Society of Painters in Water Colours and exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1840 and 1848. His <span class="italic">Interior of West Hill House</span> (<i>c</i>.1842) is in the collection of Hastings Museum and Art Gallery. While at Hastings he served as mayor of the town and was involved with good works, including the provision of a water fountain for fishermen to wash their nets.<br>
<br>In 1849 the family left Hastings for the west country, living at Tavistock, west Devon, for a few months and then at Bideford, north Devon. It was there that Maw's interest in decorative tile-making was aroused. His daughter's journal (written <i>c</i>.1890) records visits with her father to a local potter who still used inlaid clays in the medieval fashion. &#145;It struck my father that it would not be difficult to imitate ancient encaustic tiles&#146;  (Wood). Designs were traced in local churches and the prototypes were fired by a local potter. Maw saw &#145;the germ of the business for his boys for which he had been searching and praying&#146;  (ibid., 53).<br>
<br>In 1850 Maw purchased a disused tile works at Worcester, and for two years floor tiles were made there. In 1852 the family, their workforce, and equipment moved (by special train) to Benthall, in Ironbridge Gorge, Shropshire, to be closer to sources of coal and suitable clay. The family firm grew rapidly over the next decade, the demand for decorative floor tiles being fuelled by the building and restoration of churches and grand civic buildings. Wall-tiling and glazed architectural faience were added to the product range, and designs were commissioned from leading architects. Meanwhile, the Maw family was locally involved with establishing the Coalbrookdale School of Art, lending pictures from their private collection for an exhibition at the opening of the new building in 1859. The firm achieved considerable success at the 1862 International Exhibition in London in connection with its majolica fireplace tiles in the Moorish style. Maw's sons, George and Arthur, became more prominent in running the tile works, but all members of the family travelled widely in Europe and north Africa, using the opportunity to draw and trace tile designs from other cultures. A great many tiles were exported to the British empire and the United States. By the 1880s the Maws manufacturing site at Benthall had become too restricted, and land was purchased at Jackfield, a mile downstream on the River Severn, where a new Benthall works was erected and opened on 1 May 1883. Maw's wife died on 20 August 1853, after a long illness. During the latter part of his life Maw was a devout member of the Plymouth Brethren. This led to friction within the family when his daughter fell in love with Richard Wilton, curate of Broseley. Somewhat unusually, both sides of this tragic relationship are recorded by its participants (see Wood, 59; Young, 111&#150;27).<br>
<br>Maw's achievements fall into three distinct phases. His entrepreneurial flair was first demonstrated during his early years in London in the family manufacturing chemists' business. His time in Hastings was one of personal artistic development and achievement. The last thirty-three years of his life, in Shropshire, saw his business flair linked to successful artistic manufacture&#151;the epitome of a Victorian art industry. He saw decorative tile-making develop from a few crude, handmade prototypes in 1849 to the opening of the largest decorative tile works in the world in 1883.<br>
<br>Maw died at his home, Barratt's Hill House, Broseley, on 28 June 1885 and was buried, with his wife, in the graveyard of the Baptist Chapel at Broseley. The largest and most representative collection of Maws tiles is held in the Jackfield Tile Museum, part of the Ironbridge Gorge Museum, Shropshire; tile designs (on paper) are held at the museum's library in Coalbrookdale. Important examples of Maws tiles <i>in situ</i> are at Shrub Hill railway station, Worcester, where majolica tiles fill panels (<i>c</i>.1865) in the cast-iron waiting room; a geometric tiled floor (1857&#150;60) at Osgoode Hall, Toronto, Canada; and extensive and varied floor tiles (1861&#150;2) in Battlefield church, Shrewsbury.<br>
