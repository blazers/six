<span class="headword">Powell,  Edward</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Anderson of the Fens]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1608, <em>d.</em> in or after 1642), <span class="occ">protester</span>, was baptized on 8 May 1608 in the parish of Holy Trinity, Ely, Cambridgeshire, the illegitimate son of Mary Powell (<i>d</i>. 1645?), who later, in 1613, married John Anderson. As Anderson of the Fens he was prominent in protest against the drainage and enclosure of the fens around the Isle of Ely.<br>
<br>Powell spent his life in Ely, where he married Margery Marshall on 19 May 1633 and raised a family. A labourer, he was described in 1637 as a poor man when he received relief from an Ely charity. Like others in the city he had cattle which he was able to common on the surrounding fens but, again like others, he was threatened by the implementation of a major drainage and enclosure scheme in the Great Level, of which the Cambridgeshire fens formed part, led by Francis Russell, first earl of Bedford. A legal ruling in spring 1638 that Bedford had failed to perfect the drainage scheme seems to have encouraged the commoners to renew their destruction of the works and provides the background to Powell's involvement. At the beginning of June 1638 a crowd of over 200, drawn from Ely and surrounding villages and taking the name Anderson's Camp, destroyed drainage ditches on Whelpmore Fen. They did so under the guise of a game of football, a violent form of sport that often supplied a pretext for organized protest, and following rumours that Anderson was to bring the football and a hundred men.<br>
<br>Powell was arrested by the authorities at Ely in a pre-emptive move and was not present at the attack but his subsequent examination revealed why the event was popularly nicknamed Anderson's Camp. Earlier, in Lent that year, Powell had paid the town crier to summon the town's inhabitants to go to petition the king, then at Newmarket, that the losing of their fens would be the losing of their livelihoods. The next day in Ely market place Powell, cudgel in hand and at the head of a crowd of some sixty men similarly armed, defied the call of a local JP to disperse, claiming that the king had personally instructed him to report any who hindered his petition. Among his fellow commoners, it was reported, Powell claimed to have had &#145;ordinary access and speech&#146; with the king and that Charles I, on learning of the fenland commoners' plight, had wept on his shoulder  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/409/50). Powell had managed to forestall further legal action then by going to London and entering a recognizance for his good behaviour. Examined following his later arrest in June, he refused to give up his claim to common in the fens unless he could be shown the king's signet to the grant to the undertakers of the drainage work. The declaration of loyalty to the king he then made carried with it a hint of social levelling: &#145;I will obey God and the King, but no man els, for we are all but subjects&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/409/50). Powell certainly showed a defiant attitude in his dealings with the authorities at Ely; as he told the JPs, they were but the bishop's justices and not the king's, a reference to the bishop of Ely's right to appoint justices in the isle. Powell spent three weeks in gaol before being bailed, a local clergyman acting as surety for him, to appear in court at Ely in late July 1638. Perhaps because of the threat posed by popular actions to the drainage scheme over which the king had assumed control, Powell was tried on the direct advice of the attorney-general and the solicitor-general. He was fined the heavy sum of &pound;200 and sentenced to imprisonment.<br>
<br>Partly because of a fear that he might be the subject of a rescue attempt, Powell was transferred to the Newgate prison in London, from where he twice sent letters to his local minister asking him to read an appeal to his fellow inhabitants to raise a collection to secure his release or to provide him, his aged mother, wife, and children with a weekly pension. He was finally released in June 1639 and returned to Ely, where he last appears as putting his mark to a petition in 1642 from some of the inhabitants of Ely against the dean and chapter of the cathedral. Powell has been described by the historian of opposition to the drainage as &#145;evidently an educated, literate man who was reasonably articulate and had some familiarity with the law&#146;  (Lindley, 103). Although it is now known that Powell was unable to sign his name, his brief career demonstrated that he knew what it took to become a charismatic leader. As he asked of his interrogators at examination, &#145;may not a man be inspired? Then, why not I to do the poore good about their Commons?&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/409/50).<br>
