<span class="headword">Cockayne,  Thomas Oswald</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1809, <em>d.</em> 1873), <span class="occ">philologist and teacher</span>, was baptized on 20 January 1809 in Keynsham, Somerset, the eldest of nine children born to John Cockin, curate of Keynsham parish, and his wife, Louise. He was admitted into St John's College, Cambridge, as a sizar in 1824. Following a distinguished undergraduate career, Cockayne was awarded his BA degree as thirtieth wrangler in 1828, and proceeded MA in 1835. On 7 April 1833 Cockayne was ordained a deacon, and was immediately appointed as curate of Keynsham parish. Ordination to the priesthood followed on 10 October the following year. Four days later he married Janetta Edwards (1809&#150;1894), daughter of a Keynsham Baptist surgeon. In 1835 their first daughter, Florence Louisa, was born.<br>
<br>By the time his other child, Alice Eden, was baptized on 25 March 1837, Cockayne had left his position as curate and schoolteacher, and had moved to London to take up the post of assistant master at King's College School. Among his future pupils were Walter Skeat (1835&#150;1912) and Henry Sweet (1845&#150;1912), leaders of the next generation of philologists. Cockayne and his wife supplemented the assistant master's modest salary by taking in as many as nine student boarders at their home at 17 Montague Street, Bloomsbury, and, later, at 13 Manor Park, Lee. He remained at this post until his abrupt dismissal, on 20 November 1869, amid charges of using unsuitable language in his classes and speaking on improper topics to his students. Cockayne vigorously denied the use of unsuitable language, but readily admitted to discussing matters usually avoided by the other masters when they appeared in Greek and Latin passages. Although the investigating committee acknowledged a complete absence of intent to corrupt the boys, it recommended the dismissal of Cockayne for acting &#145;in direct opposition to the feeling of the age &hellip; which will tolerate no such teaching in an English School&#146;  (&#145;Report of a committee&#146;). Cockayne promptly published a pamphlet in his own defence entitled <span class="italic">Mr. Cockayne's Narrative</span>.<br>
<br>It was during his long tenure at King's College School that Cockayne distinguished himself as one of the leading philologists of his day. He was an early and active member of the London Philological Society, where he presented several papers and served as a member of the society's council. During the course of his career he published more than twenty-five books and articles. While Cockayne's early philological works dealt primarily with Greek and Latin sources, he is principally noted for his work in Anglo-Saxon. Prominent among his contributions is a three-volume work published between 1864 and 1866, in English and Anglo-Saxon, entitled <span class="italic">Leechdoms, Wortcunning, and Starcraft of Early England</span>. Cockayne also edited several books for the Early English Text Society, including <span class="italic">Hali Meidenhad</span> (1866) and <span class="italic">The Liflade of St. Juliana</span> (1872). He wrote an account of the Jews, histories of Ireland and of France, and a biography of Marshall Turenne. Between 1864 and 1870 Cockayne also published a wide-ranging series of critical and scholarly essays called <span class="italic">The Shrine: a Collection of Occasional Papers on Dry Subjects</span> (nos. 1&#150;13). A number of Cockayne's unpublished philological manuscripts survive in the Houghton Library at Harvard University.<br>
<br>Although Cockayne was a gifted and productive philologist, his pugnacious personality and abrasive <i>ad hominem</i> attacks on influential critics closed the doors to higher academic positions. He was a well-intentioned but impolitic man whose life was driven by a love of language but whose life was ultimately ruined by the unbridled use of language.<br>
<br>In June 1873, at St Ives, Cornwall, Cockayne, unemployed and unemployable, and suffering increasingly from &#145;melancholia&#146;, died as the result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He was buried in St Ives parish cemetery on 18 June 1873.<br>
