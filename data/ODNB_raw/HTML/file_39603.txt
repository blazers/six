<span class="headword">Willows,  Ernest Thompson</span>  (1886&#150;1926), <span class="occ">airship designer</span>, was born on 11 July 1886 at 11 Newport Road, St John's, Cardiff, to Joseph Thompson Willows, dental surgeon, and his wife, Evaline Louise (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Garrett). He had two younger sisters, Daisy (<i>b</i>. 1888) and Doris May (<i>b</i>. 1895). He was educated at Clifton preparatory school and then began studies as a dentist, as a pupil of his father and at Merchant Venturers Technical College in Bristol. At the age of nineteen, despite having received no formal engineering training, he designed the first practical British airship, <i>Willows I</i>. His first flight, at the beginning of June 1905, was followed by another in July with <i>Willows Ia</i>, which had a lengthened framework. In May 1908 he married Irene Rose Davies. <i>Willows II</i> appeared in November 1909 and on 4 June 1910 he flew from his workshop at East Moors, Cardiff, which lay adjacent to the later airport industrial site, and landed by way of demonstration in the city centre at 6.52 a.m., departing thirty minutes later. The triumph was clouded by the death of his infant daughter, Evelyn May, six weeks before.<br>
<br>Willows's most spectacular flight was that carried out on 6 August 1910, which took him to Crystal Palace, 150 miles from East Moors, guided <i>en route</i> by the lights of his father's car. He reached his destination at 5.40 a.m. Other successful flights included one to Paris, departing from Wormwood Scrubs on 4 November 1910 with Frank Gooden as passenger. This was conducted in <i>Willows III</i>, later known as the <i>City of Cardiff</i>, and commenced at 3.25 p.m.; they crossed the English coast near Bexhill and 3 hours and 10 minutes later arrived at Douai, landing near the Breguet factory. This achievement attracted much attention; in 1911 Willows was the only civilian to receive a pilot's certificate among the four awarded by the Royal Aero Club.<br>
<br>In all, Willows was responsible for the design of six non-rigid airships; the fifth was intended for training and was a product of Willows's collaboration with Gilbert Dennison of Birmingham, although, as previously, much financial support came from his father, who was by then living at Penarth and was south Wales representative of the Royal Automobile Club. All the Willows vessels between 1905 and 1909 were designed so close to their lifting limits that coal gas as a lifting agent was unsuitable. Willows was unable to purchase bottled, compressed hydrogen and was obliged to manufacture the gas himself, using his own, inevitably crude, facilities to dissolve zinc in dilute sulphuric acid.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of the First World War, Willows embarked on the training of officers in airship management from his own flying ground at Hendon, before being commissioned into the Royal Flying Corps as an equipment officer; he was later attached to the balloon wing at Chingford. However, perhaps his most significant contribution to the war took the form of his SS2 dirigible, constructed to Admiralty order by the Holt Thomas Airship Company Ltd. This craft was the forerunner of such anti-submarine patrol airships as the SS (Sea Scout) type, his original <i>Willows IV</i>, built partly in France and Spain, having been earlier purchased by the Royal Navy and designated Naval Airship No. 2, although later its envelope was transferred to the SS1 airship.<br>
<br>After the armistice of 1918, Willows designed no more airships and became a free balloon exhibition pilot, a new career which cost him his life on Tuesday 3 August 1926. At 3.30 p.m. balloon <i>Marana</i>, with several passengers aboard, was descending after a demonstration at Kempston's flower festival in Hoo Park, Bedford, when a gust of wind caught the aerostat in such a way that the trailing rope became entangled in a tree. Upwards of one hundred male spectators ran to assist in answer to Willows's instructions to &#145;pull it down, work hand-over-hand&#146;, but being unskilled in balloon handling, their efforts broke the trapped rope, although that to the winch held. The result was that the net containing the envelope tore, allowing gas to escape, so that the basket crashed to the ground, killing both Willows and a Mr Harbage, one of the passengers, almost immediately. The balloon envelope was later discovered at Lidlington, 6 miles away. Willows was survived by his wife and three of his four children, Clifford Reginald (<i>b</i>. 1910), Dorothy Phyllis (<i>b</i>. 1912), and Ernest Joseph Denman (<i>b</i>. 1914). He was buried at Cathays cemetery, Cardiff.<br>
