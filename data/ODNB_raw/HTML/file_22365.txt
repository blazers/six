<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Playfair, Sir  Hugh Lyon</span>  (1786&#150;1861), <span class="occ">army officer and provost of St Andrews</span>, was born at the manse, Meigle, Perthshire, on 17 November 1786, the third of four surviving sons and four daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22366/', "Dr James Playfair (1738&#150;1819)")</script>, principal of the United College, St Andrews, and his wife, Margaret Lyon (<i>d</i>. 1831). He was educated at the grammar school of Dundee before attending classes at St Andrews. In June 1804 he gained a commission in the artillery branch of the East India Company's Bengal army, following his two elder brothers, George Playfair (1782&#150;1846) of the Army Medical Service, who became chief inspector-general of hospitals in Bengal, and William Davidson Playfair (1783&#150;1852), who became a colonel in the Indian army. Hugh Lyon Playfair studied mathematics for three months in Edinburgh before gaining technical instruction at Woolwich, passing out in January 1805. He arrived in Calcutta in August 1805, having been gazetted lieutenant.<br>
<br>The military records indicate that Playfair was a man of great moral and physical courage but perhaps some obstinacy, and that he was an inspirational leader. Commanding a detachment of artillery sent to the upper provinces in November 1806, he led his troops the whole distance of 800 miles to Cawnpore without having a single man invalided or sentenced to punishment. In March 1807 General Sir John Horsford appointed him to command the artillery at Bareilly, where he both improved the discipline of the force stationed there and suppressed the forces of a robber chief, Tumon Singh. In November 1807 he was appointed to the horse artillery and sent to Agra, and in January 1809 joined the army at Saharanpur, under generals St Leger and Robert Gillespie, engaging in skirmishes with the Sikhs. Regarded as the most efficient officer in his regiment, he was appointed adjutant and quartermaster to the horse artillery in November 1809, based at Meerut from 1811. In November 1814 he took part in the assault on the Gurkha fortress of Kalunga in the Himalayas; after the death of General Gillespie in the first attack, Playfair's artillery corps was brought into action and the garrison surrendered on 30 November 1814. Playfair was wounded twice during the fighting. In October 1815 he was promoted to be captain of horse artillery.<br>
<br>Playfair's health suffered in India, and he obtained leave in 1817, sailing for Europe. On the way he touched at St Helena where he met Napoleon in exile. After spending three years travelling widely in Scotland, Ireland, and western Europe, he revisited St Andrews in 1820, receiving the freedom of the city. Having gone to India penniless, he now had a sufficient fortune to buy a large house, St Leonard's West, part of the old St Leonard's College, St Andrews. This was surely a remarkable achievement for a serving artillery officer, and indicated marked financial abilities, from which St Andrews, both town and university, would later benefit. On 7 March 1820 he married Jane, daughter of William Dalgleish of Scotscraig, Fife; they had six sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>Playfair returned to India in the summer of 1820. At his request he was appointed superintendent of the great military road between Calcutta and Benares, a post previously held by his brother William Playfair. During over six years in charge of the road he made major improvements including a system of staging bungalows. In June 1827 he was promoted to be major, commanding the fourth battalion of artillery at Dum-Dum until July 1831. He resigned from the service in February 1834. His campaigning and managerial abilities were recognized by his senior officers. For his men he set up a library and a theatre, and instituted an informal court where minor offenders were tried (and fined) by their peers &#145;with the happiest results&#146;  (Louden, 12n).<br>
<br>These were the abilities Playfair brought to St Andrews, where he settled permanently on his return to Scotland in 1832. Universally nicknamed &#145;the Major&#146; (although actually gazetted lieutenant-colonel), he was elected provost of St Andrews in 1842, and held the office until his death. At the time of his election the city was in decay, and many of the buildings were in a state of dilapidation, while the town council was helpless, being divided into bitterly antagonistic factions. As provost, Playfair immediately instituted a programme of radical urban reform. Pavements and streets were drained and surfaced, and street frontages were straightened, controversially, by pulling down forestairs, porches, and other &#145;excrescences&#146;. Several new streets were driven through, the foundation stone of Queen Street being laid in 1858. Playfair organized an appeal in 1846 to fund drainage, public baths, a town hall, and a public library. The largest work of his regime was the new town hall, which still survives. So extensive were the construction works that it was claimed during the 1840s, a period of trade depression and hunger in the rest of the country, that there were no unemployed men in St Andrews. Playfair also sought to improve facilities for leisure, including a plan to encircle the town with a network of footpaths. Opportunities were provided for tossing the caber, and a bowling green was laid out. Playfair was a keen actor and laid on amateur theatricals in the private theatre erected in the grounds of his house.<br>
<br>Playfair's negotiating skills helped to ensure the success of deputations to the Treasury and Home Office on behalf of the University of St Andrews, which secured nearly &pound;9000 in government grants enabling the present United College quadrangle to be built. It was also through his efforts that the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, of which he became captain, was put on a firm footing, and the golf links were saved from erosion. He was the prime mover in the foundation of the Union Club (1835) which later merged with the Royal and Ancient, and was responsible for building the present clubhouse. He was a ruthlessly efficient golfer, winning the first gold medal at the autumn meeting of the St Andrews club in September 1818. His proficiency was commemorated in the golfing verse (&#145;Golfiana&#146;, 1833) of George Fullerton Carnegie. Through his friendship with Antoine Claudet he also pioneered photography in St Andrews.<br>
<br>Some of Playfair's schemes ran into local opposition, and he endured much personal criticism. But he had a dry sense of humour which he used to goad people into carrying out his plans. He liked to &#145;shock old women of both sexes and to put cant out of countenance&#146;. He was at ease in all levels of society. A contemporary painting (<span class="italic">A Grand Match of Golf</span>, 1844) shows him playing golf with the earl of Crawford and Sir Ralph Anstruther, while he is also described as walking down South Street &#145;with a veritable fish-wife on each arm, sharing their somewhat noisy confidences with an admirable affectation of interest&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 335). Although himself an ultra-tory in politics (he regretted the passing of the 1832 <span class="roman">Reform Act</span>), he was able by his force of personality to reconcile individuals of strongly contending views. He had a remarkable aptitude as a fund-raiser: although he was wealthy enough to buy property at will when obdurate owners stood in the way of his plans, most of his town improvements were paid for by public subscription. His nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22368/', "Lyon Playfair (1818&#150;1898)")</script> wrote that:<blockquote>he laboured with the will and authority of an autocrat, and forced money by subscription with the audacity of a highwayman. Naturally he constantly gave offence, but as his reforms were always justified by their good results, the Major's tyrannies were condoned.</blockquote>He was knighted (KCB) on 12 March 1856, and received the degree of LLD from St Andrews in the same year.<br>
<br>Playfair was a thickset man with a florid, heavy featured face, shaggy grey side-whiskers, and penetrating eyes. Deeply religious, he published <span class="italic">First Catechism of the Principles of Religion</span> (1853). He died at his home, St Leonard's West, St Andrews, on 21 January 1861, and was buried in St Andrews Cathedral ground on 27 January.<br>
