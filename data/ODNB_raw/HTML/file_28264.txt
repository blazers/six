<span class="headword">Vicars,  John</span>  (1580&#150;1652), <span class="occ">chronicler and poet</span>, was probably born in London. Orphaned when young, he was brought up and educated on the charity of Christ's Hospital, London. As a penniless young man he was enabled by a stroke of providence (a lucky find, as he recalls in his will) to study for some time at Queen's College, Oxford, but not for long enough to graduate: he lamented that he was &#145;(ah too soone) wained from the brests of my Sacred <i>Mother</i> the most famous University of Oxford&#146;. He returned to Christ's Hospital as usher and remained there until old age, referring to himself as &#145;schoolmaster&#146; in his will. He started writing translations, and his works show knowledge of Greek and Hebrew as well as of Latin. He published a translation of Virgil's <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> (1632). In his sixties when the civil war broke out, Vicars, a devout Calvinist and presbyterian, threw himself into the cause, heart and soul. His series of four chronicles, <span class="italic">Jehovah-Jireh, or, God in the Mount</span> (parts 1 and 2, 1644), <span class="italic">Gods Arke over-Topping the Waves</span> (1646), and <span class="italic">The Burning-Bush not Consumed</span> (1646), is an important source for historians. Although reluctant to concede any victories to the royalists, they provide many valuable details, being based on fresh eyewitness accounts; for example, he names his main informant for his account of the battle of Edgehill as Captain Nathaniel Fiennes, who fought in it. Vicars presents the parliamentarian commanders, particularly Sir Thomas Fairfax and the New Model Army, in a heroic light and stresses the role played by the tradesmen and apprentices of London. He compares Fairfax to Julius Caesar and praises his mercy after the battle of Marston Moor. He is scathing in his presentation of the royalists, and emphatic in asserting divine providence on the parliamentarian side. His description of the confusion caused by the wearing of a variety of colours on both sides belies popular anachronistic stereotypes. In <span class="italic">England's Worthies</span> (1647) Vicars wrote eulogies of Cromwell and the other parliamentary leaders.<br>
<br>Vicars's poems often comment on politics, for example, the Spanish match for Prince Charles and public jubilation when it failed. Despite believing, as Hill notes, that England was an elect nation  (Vicars, <span class="italic">England's Hallelu-jah</span>, 1631), Vicars was essentially a militant protestant who wanted a confessional foreign policy. In <span class="italic">England's Remembrancer</span> (1641) he expressed solidarity with the Huguenots of La Rochelle, and advised Charles I to intervene on behalf of the protestants in the Thirty Years' War (&#145;Thy royall Sisters poore Palatinate&#146;). Apocalyptic beliefs, especially the papal Antichrist, abound in his works. His early translation in 1617 of Francis Herring's work as <span class="italic">Mischeefe's Mysterie</span>, recast in heroic couplets in 1641 as <span class="italic">The Quintessence of Cruelty</span>, is related to the apocalyptic comedies of Foxe and Dekker in its theology and its use of extended dialogue. Its allegory of the Whore of Rome spawning, with Pluto, a son, Treason, resembles Milton's allegory of Satan, Sin, and Death in book I of <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>. <span class="italic">The Quintessence of Cruelty</span> has a commendatory quatrain contributed by William Prynne, who addresses Vicars as &#145;his most affectionate, kind Friend&#146;. It may have been Prynne's friendship which furthered Vicars's work as parliamentary propagandist.<br>
<br>Vicars married Jane, probably either Brackley or Stevens (his will refers to his &#145;most dearely beloved friend and brother Mr Thomas Birackley [<i>sic</i>]&#146; and also to &#145;my most dearely beloved brother Mr Paul Stevens&#146;). He had a son, John, who was ordained, and two daughters, Frances and Hester. He died at Christ's Hospital on 12 April 1652, leaving bequests to it and to the poor of London and Witney in gratitude for the benevolence he felt he had received. He asked to be buried as near as possible to the school which had taken him in &#145;when my Father and mother forsooke me&#146; and this was done. His gravestone in Christ Church Greyfriars was destroyed in the great fire of London.<br>
