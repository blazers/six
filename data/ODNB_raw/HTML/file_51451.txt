<span class="headword">Barnes,  John Henry</span>  (1850&#150;1925), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born at Watlington, Oxfordshire, on 26 February 1850, the son of John Barnes, a miller and farmer, and his wife, Mildred (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith). His interest in acting was awakened by the sermons of J. C. M. Bellew, whom he considered to be &#145;the very best reader and elocutionist that I have ever heard&#146;  (Barnes, 5). Barnes's father would not hear of him going into the theatre, but after his father's death in 1868 Barnes made his first public appearance as a reader at the Westbourne Hall, Bayswater, on 22 October 1870. His stage d&eacute;but took place on the auspicious first night of Henry Irving's production of <span class="italic">The Bells</span> at the Lyceum Theatre, on 25 November 1871, when he appeared as Irving's double. Although he began his career with the rising star of the London theatre, Barnes later gained wide experience in the provinces, where he worked with several notable managers: Edward Saker in Liverpool, Mrs Wyndham in Edinburgh, and Charles Calvert in Manchester. While at the Theatre Royal in Manchester he played alongside the veteran Samuel Phelps&#151;thus began &#145;my worship of Samuel Phelps&#146;  (Barnes, 67).<br>
<br>Generally known as Handsome Jack Barnes, throughout his career Barnes partnered a succession of celebrated leading ladies, who were glad to avail themselves of his attractive stage presence but were reassured that their own performances would not be eclipsed. He accompanied Adelaide Neilson to America in 1874; supported Genevi&egrave;ve Ward at the Lyceum in 1879; and partnered Madame Ristori at Drury Lane in 1882 (including Macbeth to her Lady Macbeth) and Mary Anderson at the Lyceum in 1883 and thereafter on the ill-fated American tour which ended with her retirement from the stage. His association with Ellen Terry stretched from Bassanio to her Portia in Irving's revival of <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> (Lyceum, 1 November 1879) to Sir Howard Hallam to her Lady Cicely Waynflete in Shaw's <span class="italic">Captain Brassbound's Conversion</span> for the Vedrenne&#150;Barker management (Court Theatre, 20 March 1906).<br>
<br>Barnes belonged to a generation of actors whose careers bridged the Atlantic Ocean. As early as 1875 he took his own company to Canada, and scarcely had he disembarked in England on 3 June 1891 than he set sail again for New York on 16 September and remained in America for several years. In 1905 he worked there for Charles Frohman.<br>
<br>During Barnes's lengthy career his chosen profession changed beyond recognition. Like Johnston Forbes-Robertson, also an admirer of Phelps, Barnes provided continuity with the past. He appeared as Polonius to Forbes-Robertson's Hamlet at the Lyceum Theatre (11 September 1897), when his performance was not admired by Shaw. Barnes and Forbes-Robertson were reunited in their <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> roles for the latter's farewell season at Drury Lane (22 March 1913), shortly after which the two veterans shared the &#145;curious experience of being filmed for moving pictures in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>&#146;, produced by Cecil Hepworth, at Walton-on-Thames  (Barnes, 307). Appropriately, Barnes's last West End performance, at the Shaftesbury Theatre (17 April 1923), was as Lester Montague in <span class="italic">Merton of the Movies</span> by George S. Kaufman and Marc Connelly.<br>
<br>Though never a star in his own right, Barnes was a highly respected member of his profession: he was a founder member of the Green Room Club; worshipful master of the Drury Lane freemasons' lodge (1901); an advocate of and later instructor at the (Royal) Academy of Dramatic Art; and the recipient of a complimentary benefit matin&eacute;e at the Palace Theatre (17 March 1922). Apart from his memoirs, <span class="italic">Forty Years on the Stage</span> (originally published serially in <span class="italic">The Stage</span> from October 1913), he wrote what he termed &#145;serious verse&#146; and articles in the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>. He died at his home, Wyndham House, Shoot-up Hill, Cricklewood, on 10 November 1925, leaving a widow, Mary L. Barnes.<br>
