<span class="headword">Bailey,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1791, <em>d.</em> 1870), <span class="occ">economist and philosopher</span>, was baptized on 8 July 1791 at St Peter's Church (later the cathedral), Sheffield, the second son and fifth of the eleven children of Joseph Bailey, of Burngreave, and Mary Eaden. His father, originally an artisan, had become wealthy in the cutlery business (he was master cutler in 1801) and as a merchant. Samuel was educated in the free school at Sheffield, where his maternal grandfather was a master, and later at the Moravian school in Fulneck. A reserved boy, his only known recreation was that of riding on a schoolfellow's back.<br>
<br>Having left school, Samuel joined his father in the family firm, and he was one of the first Sheffield merchants to visit the United States, so as to establish business connections there. However, his real interest lay in writing and in public affairs. In 1821 he published <span class="italic">Essays on the Formation and Publication of Opinions and other Subjects</span>; a third edition appeared in 1831, the year in which he helped to found the Sheffield Banking Company, of which he was the first chairman. In his <span class="italic">Essays</span> Bailey argued that people were not responsible for their opinions because those are independent of the will; hence opinions should not be met with censure or punishment.<br>
<br>In his work on economics Bailey's main achievement was to take on the Ricardian establishment, in the years when David Ricardo's theories were at their most influential. In <span class="italic">A Critical Dissertation on the Nature, Measure and Causes of Value</span>, published in 1825, he challenged the basic assumption of Ricardo that value was determined by labour. To him, value was a relative concept, springing from subjective causes; the degree of &#145;esteem&#146; or &#145;mental affection&#146;, much like the later utility, governed the intensity of demand. Supply conditions, such as output under constant or variable cost, could also affect relative values. Thus value could vary, especially from one period to another.<br>
<br>Bailey also exposed what he saw as the weaknesses of Ricardo's subsistence theory of wages, for example by means of applying the analysis of rent to wage differentials so as to reflect labour scarcity or variations in skill. Despite these perceptive insights, however, he did not go on to create an alternative and less rigid model of the economic system. Having immersed himself in too broad a range of intellectual interests, he had limited knowledge of the economic literature, and his work bore all the hallmarks of a self-taught and reclusive thinker. Not surprisingly, his writings provoked a range of conflicting reactions from economists. James Mill in 1826 (in an anonymous article in the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>, rebuffed that same year by Bailey), Malthus in 1827, and McCulloch in 1845 all claimed that he was playing with definitions rather than undermining the Ricardian edifice. He tended to receive more sympathetic treatment in the twentieth century. J. A. Schumpeter, in his idiosyncratic <span class="italic">History of Economic Analysis</span>, judged that Bailey's work of 1825 &#145;must rank among the masterpieces of criticism in our field&#146; and should &#145;suffice to secure to its author a place in or near front rank in the history of scientific economics&#146;  (Schumpeter, 486).<br>
<br>Bailey's other writings were mainly noted for their terseness and vigour of style. They included an extension of his work on opinions in 1829, and pamphlets on political representation and on the fluctuating value of money in the 1830s. The politics displayed in these works are those of a moderate utilitarian radical with a strong objection to state interference. His forays into philosophy clearly showed up his imperfect grasp of the subject. Thus his <span class="italic">Review of Berkeley's Theory of Vision</span> (1842) sought to demonstrate that Berkeley missed the point by assuming that space in a direct line from the eye was not directly visible. When taken to task by John Stuart Mill, Bailey's riposte was that people have a direct perception of external objects, which cannot be analysed into a complex operation. His <span class="italic">Theory of Reasoning</span> (1851) and three series of <span class="italic">Letters on the Philosophy of the Human Mind</span> (1855&#150;63) caused less stir among fellow philosophers, being more fragmentary and discursive but with occasional flashes of insight. The latter sustains Bailey's criticism of Berkeley but also enlists Berkeley's nominalism in an attack on the theory of &#145;abstract ideas&#146;. He criticizes German philosophers, especially Kant, and makes a defence of utilitarianism and determinism. His poetic works and two unscholarly volumes of textual amendments to Shakespeare's plays (1861&#150;2) were soon forgotten, and his many manuscripts were not preserved.<br>
<br>In 1828 Bailey was elected one of the town trustees of Sheffield, and he later retired from his firm to embark on a political career. That was a total failure, as the voters of Sheffield had no time for his radical schemes of triennial parliaments, the secret ballot, and the abolition of tithes and taxes on knowledge; he came bottom of the poll in the general elections of 1831 and 1834 and never again entered the fray. He was several times president of the Sheffield Literary and Philosophical Society. Being unmarried, he adopted a lifestyle of quiet seclusion, admitting no intimate friends and few acquaintances, and of clockwork regularity. He attended board meetings of his bank with absolute punctuality to the last. His only break from routine was an annual visit to his sister-in-law at Cheltenham for a change of air. He died suddenly as he left his bath on 18 January 1870, at his home at Norbury, Sheffield. Of his &pound;120,000 fortune, he left over &pound;80,000 to the town trust.<br>
