<span class="headword">Monks <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Green]</span>,  Constance Mary <span class="st"> [Connie]</span></span>  (1911&#150;1989), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at 66 Preston Road, Chorley, Lancashire, on 20 May 1911, the daughter of Ellis Green, an education clerk, and his wife, Bessie Anderton, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Burwell, daughter of W. W. Burwell JP, first chairman of Chorley rural district council. From Wheelton county school she won a scholarship to Chorley grammar school, where she excelled at sports and became head girl, after which she trained as a schoolteacher at Leeds City Training College, specializing in geography. In 1931 she became an assistant teacher at Coppull Moor Church of England school in Lancashire. On 11 May 1937 she married Jack Monks (<i>b</i>. 1911/12), a grocer from Chorley; he was the son of John William Monks, spinner. Their only child, a son, died in youth. During the Second World War her husband joined the RAF and she taught at Coppull Moor School before transferring to Chorley parochial girls' school in 1943. In 1945, after his demobilization, they opened a newsagent and tobacconist shop.<br>
<br>In 1945 Connie Monks, who had become involved in Conservative politics in her teenage years, co-founded a branch of the Young Conservatives in Chorley and became secretary of the North-West Conservative Association. In November 1947 she was elected to Chorley borough council, and went on to serve on every council committee and almost every public organization in Chorley. She was a governor of ten local schools, and from 1954 was a magistrate. In 1959 she was mayor of Chorley, and from 1961 to 1964 served for one term on Lancashire county council. She chaired the Conservative Women's Advisory Committee for Lancashire, Cheshire, and Westmorland.<br>
<br>In 1965, at her second attempt, Monks was selected as Conservative Party candidate for the Chorley parliamentary seat. She failed to dislodge her Labour opponent in the general election of 1966 but in 1970 won the seat to become Chorley's first Conservative MP since 1945. She was among fifteen women Conservative MPs to be elected. Her deep constituency roots were unusual for a Conservative MP at that time, and she hoped that her local activities would demonstrate democracy at its best and combat public cynicism about politics. Her visits home every weekend were successfully combined with excellent parliamentary attendance, though her shyness kept her from speaking very often. As a campaigner she preferred door-to-door canvassing to addressing meetings. Among the issues which she did discuss in parliament were the new town in Lancashire (about which she was sceptical), local government reform, and education: she took a cautious view of the move to create comprehensive schools and abolish the eleven-plus examination.<br>
<br>At the general election held in March 1974, Chorley was a marginal seat and leading figures of both parties campaigned there. Monks was narrowly defeated and, wishing to spend more time with her husband, she declined to contest the election of October 1974, despite the continued support of her party. In the local-government reforms of 1974 Chorley borough council was replaced by a new body, and she stood down after twenty-seven years' membership (seven of which were spent as an alderman). Her husband died not long afterwards and this, combined with the earlier loss of her son, drained much of her spark. As one who felt that changing attitudes was more important than legislation, she made little impact during her brief stint in parliament but she was extremely devoted to her community. Even there, though, her contributions eventually faded from public memory as the market town which she had known was transformed through expansion. After a long illness she died of kidney failure and senile dementia in Chorley and District Hospital, Preston Road, Chorley, on 4 February 1989 and was buried in Chorley cemetery.<br>
