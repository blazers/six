<span class="headword">Moore,  (Charles) Garrett Ponsonby</span>, eleventh earl of Drogheda  (1910&#150;1989), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and opera manager</span>, was born at 40 Wilton Crescent, London, on 23 April 1910, the elder child and only son of Henry Charles Ponsonby Moore, tenth earl of Drogheda, diplomatist, and his wife, Kathleen, daughter of Charles Maitland Pelham Burn, of Grange Park, Edinburgh. He was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, which he left early, without a degree. After two years' bookkeeping at the Mining Trust, the first turning-point of his career came in 1932 when, at Brooks's Club in London, he met Brendan Bracken, and went to work for him at the <span class="italic">Financial News</span>, selling advertising space. He worked hard at mastering the detail of the newspaper business, made a considerable impression on Bracken, and developed a long, close relationship with him. In 1935 he married Joan Eleanor (1903&#150;1989), daughter of William Henry Carr, who left her mother when she was born. She was an excellent pianist, whose immaculate musical taste stood him often in good stead. They had one child, a son.<br>
<br>In the Second World War he served briefly in France, as a captain with the 53rd battalion of the heavy anti-aircraft regiment, Royal Artillery, and was then appointed to the staff of the war cabinet secretariat (1941) and later the Ministry of Production (1942&#150;5). By the end of the war he was back at the <span class="italic">Financial News</span>, as managing director.<br>
<br>In 1945, at Bracken's instruction, he went out and bought the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>. The two newspapers merged under the one title. For twenty-five years, as managing director of the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> (1945&#150;70), Drogheda (who succeeded his father in 1957) devoted himself to its commercial expansion and editorial improvement, taking particular pleasure in stimulating its coverage of the arts, the other great passion and interest of his life. He allowed the editor, Sir L. Gordon Newton, to edit, but pursued him daily with a string of memoranda, demanding answers to pertinent questions. If none was received Drogheda persisted.<br>
<br>Drogheda used the same tactic at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, where, after serving as secretary to the board from 1951, he was its chairman from 1958 to 1974. He bombarded the general administrators, Sir David Webster and later Sir John Tooley, with similar missives, which were known as Droghedagrams. At Covent Garden Drogheda attempted to insist that the board was entitled to approve executive artistic decisions, such as the choice of designer for a particular opera. Webster resisted and Georg Solti, engaged by Drogheda as musical director from 1961, never tolerated such interference. Solti's appointment, the decision to give opera in the original language rather than in English, and the high standards that resulted were the principal achievements of Drogheda's chairmanship, which also saw the birth and growth of the Friends of Covent Garden. The Droghedagrams were addressed also to those critics on the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>'s pages and elsewhere whose views did not, in the author's opinion, do the opera house justice. These would arrive by messenger on a motorcycle early in the morning the review appeared. It was not unknown for them to be brought round, should the victim live close enough to his house in Lord North Street, by Drogheda himself, in slippers, pyjamas, and dressing-gown.<br>
<br>Drogheda's handsome looks and languid appearance concealed an iron determination to secure his ends. Charming, but obdurate; a dandy, but determined; debonair, but persistent, he would stop at nothing on the newspaper's or the opera house's commercial behalf, pursuing advertisers or possible benefactors without compunction. He struck up friendships with employees of every rank, and treated very many with great personal kindness. He had an acute mind, which expressed itself fluently and clearly on paper, but was guided, he himself thought, always by instinct.<br>
<br>Drogheda was chairman of Financial Times Ltd (1971&#150;5) and of the Newspaper Publishers' Association (1968&#150;70). He chaired the London celebrations committee for the queen's silver jubilee in 1977. From 1941 he served as a director of <span class="italic">The Economist</span>, to which he was much attached. He was a commander of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur (1960) and of the order of merit of Italy (1968) and was grand officer of the order of Leopold II of Belgium (1974). He was appointed OBE in 1946, KBE in 1964, and knight of the Garter in 1972.<br>
<br>Drogheda died on 24 December 1989 (eight days after his wife), at Englefield Green, Surrey. He was succeeded in the earldom by his son, Henry Dermot Ponsonby Moore (<i>b</i>. 1937).<br>
