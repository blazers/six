<span class="headword">Starkey,  James Sullivan</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Seumas O'Sullivan]</span>  (1879&#150;1958), <span class="occ">writer and editor</span>, was born on 17 July 1879 at 80 Rathmines Road, Dublin, the third son of the five children of William Starkey (1836&#150;1918), pharmacist, and his wife, Annie Sullivan (<i>d</i>. 1922), daughter of the Revd James Starkey (<i>d</i>. 1851) of Ballinasloe. The family was strictly Methodist and politically unionist. Starkey was educated by governesses before going to Wesley College, Dublin, aged twelve. His first real interest in books came from his father, and as a child he was obsessed with the advertising cards for books. During his life he accumulated a vast library of about 20,000 items, many of them rare editions. James Starkey studied medicine at University College, Dublin, but dropped out after a year owing to problems with mathematics. He then entered his father's pharmacy as an apprentice, but his main interest was in &#145;poetry and life&#146;.<br>
<br>Through his friend Tom Keohler, Starkey was introduced to George Russell (A. E.), and soon became known in the circles of the Irish literary revival. Starkey's poetry was firstly published in the <span class="italic">Irish Homestead</span> in 1902, and in the same year reprinted in the <span class="italic">Southern Cross</span> under the pseudonym Ogma. In 1903 he published four poems in Griffith's <span class="italic">United Irishman</span>, which were reprinted in A. E.'s book <span class="italic">New Songs</span> in 1904. By this time he was using the pseudonym Seumas O'Sullivan, which he took from his maternal grandfather who had published books in Irish. O'Sullivan became known as one of the &#145;Celtic twilight&#146; poets, since his poetry at that time was essentially lyrical and melancholy, dealing with Irish folklore, and moods expressed through the Irish landscape. It was characterized by simplicity of language, and a good sense of rhythm, language, and syntax. His poetry was original, but he was often compared to A. E., who had influenced him; they shared an interest in visions, fairies, and Celtic gods.<br>
<br>O'Sullivan also had a keen interest in Irish theatre. He was one of the founding members of the Irish National Dramatic Society (also referred to as the Irish National Theatre Society) in 1901, and was involved in its management committee, but also did some acting. He performed the role of the Blind Man in Yeats's <span class="italic">On Baile Strand</span> at the opening night of the Abbey Theatre on 27 December 1904, but admitted that he was not a good actor. Edward Martyn, O'Sullivan, and others split from the Irish National Theatre Society in 1906, claiming it had become too commercial, and less nationalist. The dissidents formed the Theatre of Ireland.<br>
<br>In 1904 O'Sullivan and the actor and poet George Roberts re-established the publishing firm of Whaley &amp; Co. In 1905 his first book <span class="italic">The Twilight People</span>, the title alluding to the airy immaterial fairies of his incorporeal world, was published by Whaley &amp; Co. in Dublin and A. H. Bullen in London. In the same year O'Sullivan began to edit, with James Connolly, the <span class="roman">Tower Press Booklets</span> (printed at 28 Cornmarket, Dublin), which were intended to encourage some established and lesser known poets, such as Thomas Keohler, George Moore, and Susan Mitchell. One of the booklets, <span class="italic">Verses: Sacred and Profane</span>, contained some of his own works, which emphasized the beauty of decay. <span class="italic">The Earth Lover and other Verses</span> (1909) was more vivacious than his previous works. This was followed by <span class="italic">Impressions: a Selection from the Notebooks of the Late J. H. Orwell</span> (1910). Some of his verse also appeared in <span class="italic">Sinn F&eacute;in</span>, and his writings became known in America.<br>
<br>At this time O'Sullivan met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59823/', "Estella Frances Solomons (1882&#150;1968)")</script>, daughter of Maurice Solomons, a Dublin optician, and Rosa Jane Jacobs of Hull, who were practising Jews, and active in the Dublin Jewish community. O'Sullivan and Solomons moved in the same artistic and literary circles, and both were intensely nationalist. She was a painter who hid rebels in her studio in Great Brunswick Street, Dublin, during the War of Independence. Since her father objected to any of his children marrying outside Judaism, the couple did not marry until 5 August 1926, after Solomons's parents had died. They had no children. It was a happy marriage, and many writers met at their house on Sundays.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Requiem and other Poems</span> (1917) emphasized O'Sullivan's nationalist beliefs, which become even more pronounced in <span class="italic">The Rosses and other Poems</span> (1918). A collection of essays, <span class="italic">Mud and Purple</span> (1917), dedicated to Oliver Gogarty, showed his delight in character portrayal and his ability to describe Dublin's many moods. In 1913 he supported A. E. in his campaign against the employers during the Dublin strike.<br>
<br>O'Sullivan was also close friends with the Irish nationalist leader Arthur Griffith and worked with him on the <span class="italic">Irish Year Book</span>, learning much from him as an editor. Together with Gogarty, they stayed frequently at the Martello tower at Sandycove. In 1918 O'Sullivan produced <span class="italic">Secret Springs of Dublin Song</span> with Gogarty and others. Seumas O'Kelly, with whom he had founded the Theatre of Ireland, was another close friend, and the two shared a house together for some time. O'Sullivan was one of the seven founding members of the Irish Academy of Letters, a member of its council for years, and its vice-president. However, he had frequent disagreements with Yeats in the council: their personalities were perhaps too similar for comfort. In 1923 O'Sullivan founded the <span class="italic">Dublin Magazine</span> which nobody expected to survive since Ireland was torn apart by the civil war. His optimism was justified, however, because for over thirty years the <span class="italic">Dublin Magazine</span> attracted the work of virtually all the established writers, such as Austin Clarke and Liam O'Flaherty, and encouraged younger writers like Samuel Beckett, Patrick Kavanagh, and Mary Lavin. It ceased publication as a monthly in August 1925 because it was difficult to get original material, very demanding for the editor to publish monthly, and there was little advertising revenue. It reappeared in January 1926 as a quarterly. O'Sullivan was a dedicated, courteous, fastidious, and eclectic editor. At the same time he was president of Dublin PEN for several years, and a member of the Old Dublin Society. The <span class="italic">Dublin Magazine</span> ceased publication after O'Sullivan died. It was revived in the 1960s, but could not obtain the same readership and standing as before.<br>
<br>O'Sullivan continued to publish his own work including <span class="italic">Common Adventures: a Book of Prose and Verse</span> (1926) and <span class="italic">The Lamplighter and other Poems</span> (1929). The latter dealt with the physical and spiritual reconstruction of the Irish after the civil war. O'Sullivan often published his poetry in private and limited editions, such as <span class="italic">Twenty-Five Lyrics</span> (1933), <span class="italic">Personal Talk: a Book of Verses</span> (1936), and <span class="italic">Facetae et curiosa</span> (1937). His celebration of the power of love is evident throughout his poems. O'Sullivan's <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> were published in 1940 but only in 1943 did he produce some new verse in <span class="italic">This is the House and other Verses</span>. <span class="italic">Essays and Recollections</span> (1944) contained detailed reminiscences about characters and friends of his Dublin childhood and youth; there were more literary recollections in <span class="italic">The Rose and Bottle</span> (1946). His final book of poems, <span class="italic">Translations and transcriptions</span>, appeared in 1950; it contained no new material.<br>
<br>O'Sullivan received an honorary degree (DLitt) from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1939 and in 1957 he was presented with the Gregory medal by the Irish Academy of Letters. O'Sullivan was a shy, retiring, moderate, and kind person. However, he could also be very witty and satirical, since he possessed a sharp tongue. He and his wife were sticklers for order. He became a vegetarian in 1901. Seumas O'Sullivan died on 24 March 1958 at Mercer's Hospital, Dublin.<br>
