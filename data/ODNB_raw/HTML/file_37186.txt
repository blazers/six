<span class="headword">Bernard,  Oliver Percy</span>  (1881&#150;1939), <span class="occ">architect and designer</span>, was born on 8 April 1881 at 2 Box Villas, Danby Street, Camberwell, London, the younger son (there were no daughters) of Charles Bernard 
    (formerly Charles West; <i>d</i>. 1894)
  , theatrical manager of Scottish descent, and his wife, Annie Allen, actress, of Glasgow. There was also another son from a previous marriage. Bernard was married first on 23 October 1911 to Muriel Theresa Lightfoot (<i>b</i>. 1884/5), singer, daughter of Jabez Lightfoot, manager of the Bengal and North Western Railway. This marriage, of which there were no children, was dissolved in 1924 and in the same year he married (Edith) Dora Hodges (1896&#150;1950), an opera singer with the stage name Fedora Roselli, daughter of Joseph Hodges, butcher, of Tooting; they had three sons and two daughters, one of whom died in infancy. Oliver Bernard, poet and translator, was his eldest son; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73850/', "Bruce Bonus Bernard (1928&#150;2000)")</script>, photographer, picture editor, and art critic, was his second; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68104/', "Jeffrey Joseph Bernard (1932&#150;1997)")</script>, journalist, was the youngest.<br>
<br>Bernard grew up at 8 Waterloo Road, London, a household kept by his father, containing, in Bernard's words, &#145;vague and violent people together, to whom parents had consigned a son who would have encumbered their travels&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cock Sparrow</span>, 11&#150;12). On the death of his father in 1894, Bernard went to Manchester and found work as a &#145;property boy and paint-room drudge&#146;, educating himself by reading, among others, John Locke and John Ruskin, and practising drawing  (<span class="italic">Cock Sparrow</span>, 35). He escaped from Manchester as cabin-boy in a tramp steamer, the <i>Manchester Commerce</i>, and, tiring of this, became a seaman in the Norwegian barque <i>Naja</i>, a terrifying experience recounted in his autobiography. He resumed scene painting in London, in the studio of Walter Hann, participating in the sporting scene as a boxer and billiards player. He travelled to New York in the autumn of 1905 and became principal scenic artist for Klaw and Erlanger, and later technical director for the Boston Opera Company. Here, and again in London, as resident scenic artist for the Grand Opera Syndicate at Covent Garden, he became frustrated by the conservatism of management with regard to production and scenery, and returned to America after the outbreak of the First World War, having been rejected for military service because of deafness. Determined to try again, he crossed back in the <i>Lusitania</i>, and survived its sinking on 7 May 1915. Early in 1916 he was commissioned as a camouflage officer in the Royal Engineers and served in France, Italy, and Belgium, reaching the rank of captain. He was awarded the MC and appointed OBE.<br>
<br>In 1919 Bernard returned to the London theatre, designing Wagner's <span class="roman">Ring</span> cycle for Sir Thomas Beecham in the 1921 Covent Garden season. Acting as consultant to the board of overseas trade, he worked on the British Empire Exhibition, Wembley, in 1924, as a designer of friezes, decorations, and displays. He designed a new system of lighting and stage planning for the Admiralty Theatre and staged the <span class="italic">Raid on Zeebrugge</span> and <span class="italic">Air Attack on London</span>. For the Paris 1925 exhibition, Bernard was technical director for the British government, but he achieved his greatest fame as consultant artistic director to the caterers J. Lyons &amp; Co. For the Strand Palace Hotel, he designed in 1929 a spectacular entrance of reflective metal and concealed lighting, and other interiors for the Oxford Street, Coventry Street, and Strand Corner Houses, and in 1932 for the Cumberland Hotel, with many separate restaurants in each building, cleverly exploiting new materials and techniques in a popular decorative manner.<br>
<br>Bernard's knowledge of continental modern design was considerable. He displayed it in journalism, arguing that the future of architecture lay with engineers. In 1931 he was appointed consultant designer to Practical Equipment Ltd, manufacturers of tubular steel furniture. His architectural works date from the late 1930s and were mostly industrial buildings, notably the Supermarine aviation works, Southampton (1937).<br>
<br>Bernard was short in stature with a large head. His former secretary described him as &#145;amusing, utterly impossible, kind, and a bully&#146;. Bernard died unexpectedly of peritonitis on 15 April 1939 at the St Thomas Home, Lambeth Palace Road, London.<br>
