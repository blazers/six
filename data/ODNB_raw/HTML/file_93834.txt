<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cahill,  Joseph <span class="st"> [Joe]</span></span>  (1920&#150;2004), <span class="occ">Irish republican activist</span>, was born on 19 May 1920 at 60 Divis Street, Belfast, the eldest son and first of the eleven children of Joseph Cahill, printer, and his wife, Josephine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mulholland. A Roman Catholic, he attended St Mary's Christian Brothers School in Barrack Street, Belfast. At seventeen he joined the republican boy-scout movement na Fianna &Eacute;ireann before joining the Irish Republican Army (IRA) at eighteen.<br>
<br>On Easter Sunday 1942 Cahill was one of a five-man IRA unit detailed to create an incident to divert Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) attention from an IRA commemoration of the 1916 Easter rising. A police vehicle was fired on in the belief that it would retreat before returning with reinforcements, allowing the IRA unit to escape. However, the RUC officers immediately pursued the IRA unit. One, Patrick Murphy, saw them enter a safe house and followed without waiting for back-up. The incident ended in a gun battle. The leader of the IRA unit, Tom Williams, was hit three times and Murphy was hit five times and fatally wounded. All five members of the IRA unit, and a sixth IRA man and two women who were present in the safe house as part of the IRA support team, were charged with murder. The six men were subsequently sentenced to death. Following a large reprieve campaign (including a plea from Pope Pius XII) all but Williams had their death sentences commuted. Cahill and the four others were eventually released in October 1949.<br>
<br>Cahill, rather unusually for a Catholic and especially for a republican, worked as a joiner in the loyalist-dominated Harland and Wolff shipyard in east Belfast for a time in 1950&#150;51. Otherwise he worked in the building industry but also resumed his IRA activities. On 2 April 1956 at St John's Church, Falls Road, Belfast, he married the 20-year-old Annie Magee, of Whiterock Road, Belfast, a stitcher, and twin and joint second youngest of nine children of Edward (Ned) Magee, labourer. They had seven children. Following the initiation of the IRA's border campaign of 1956&#150;62 Cahill and other Belfast republicans were interned in Belfast's Crumlin Road gaol in January 1957. (His first child and only son, Thomas, was born two months later.) Cahill was eventually released in April 1961. The republican leadership that emerged in Dublin after the disastrous border campaign turned increasingly from armed struggle to a political approach, much to the disillusionment of Cahill, who remained a traditional physical-force republican. He resigned from the IRA in 1965, limiting his republican involvement to membership of the National Graves Association.<br>
<br>As the civil rights crisis deepened in the later 1960s Cahill claimed that anti-Catholic pogroms were inevitable but that the Dublin IRA leadership was taking no precautions to deal with such an eventuality. He and other IRA veterans attempted to organize &#145;auxiliaries&#146; for the defence of Catholic areas. When violence broke out in August 1969 and Catholic areas of Belfast came under attack, there was deep anger with the IRA among the Catholic community, who had traditionally looked to the IRA as their defenders of last resort. Cahill was among a group of veterans who demanded that the Belfast IRA leadership break with the Dublin leadership and form a separate &#145;northern command&#146;. A compromise was reached but eventually broke down. As steps were taken by Cahill and other republican dissidents in mid-December 1969 to form a separate northern command, they were contacted by Sean MacStiof&aacute;in, IRA director of intelligence, who had just left an IRA convention at which a motion had been passed ending the traditional republican policy of abstentionism (the policy of, if elected, abstaining from taking seats in the British parliaments or the two Irish parliaments, which republicans considered illegitimate and refused to recognize). MacStiof&aacute;in and other traditionalist southern republicans had vehemently opposed dropping abstentionism, and having broken with the official Dublin leadership were now organizing an alternative &#145;provisional&#146; IRA. It was on this alliance between Belfast &#145;defenders&#146; and southern traditionalists that the Provisional IRA was founded. In January 1970 Cahill attended the first Provisional IRA army convention and was elected to the army council. His first major mission was a trip to the USA with Leo Martin that November. He was well received as his traditional and &#145;defenderist&#146; version of republicanism was more in harmony with conservative Irish-American supporters of the republican movement than that of the left-wing Official IRA. During this trip, the first of many for Cahill but his only legal one until 1994, Noraid, which became the main source of American money for the Provisional IRA, was established.<br>
<br>Cahill rose to public prominence in the wake of the introduction of internment when, on 13 August 1971, as Belfast IRA commander, he appeared at a press conference in Belfast designed to demonstrate that internment had failed to capture the IRA leadership. Cahill hit the headlines again in September when he was detained for a week in New York, having been denied entry to the USA. He, with other leading Provisionals, met Harold Wilson, then in opposition, twice for private talks in Ireland in 1972. He was also part of a republican delegation, including Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, which secretly met William Whitelaw, the Conservative secretary of state for Northern Ireland, in England in July 1972. None of these talks produced tangible results.<br>
<br>Cahill became chief of staff of the Provisional IRA in late 1972, replacing Sean MacStiof&aacute;in. MacStiof&aacute;in had been opposed to an IRA campaign in England, but Cahill was to sanction such operations. In January 1973 he travelled to Libya at the invitation of the Libyan leader, Colonel Gaddafi. Gaddafi gave the IRA an arms shipment that was taken back to Ireland on the <span class="italic">Claudia</span>. However, when it was attempted to unload the vessel off the co. Waterford coast the Irish navy and police were waiting and seized the ship, arresting all on board, including Cahill. For his part in the <span class="italic">Claudia</span> incident Cahill was sentenced to three years' penal servitude in May 1973. In Mountjoy prison he took part with eleven other IRA prisoners in a hunger-strike that resulted in IRA prisoners being granted special category status. He was released on medical grounds in January 1975. He was later to suffer several heart attacks. Despite ill-health he served in various positions on the IRA army council, including quartermaster-general and adjutant-general, and is believed to have been a member of that body until the 1990s. He was elected to Sinn F&eacute;in's ard comhairle (national executive) in the late 1970s and later served as Sinn F&eacute;in national treasurer until 1995 when he was made honorary vice-president for life. In 1988 he was diagnosed as suffering from colon cancer, but recovered. While in hospital he reportedly kept the Sinn F&eacute;in account books under his mattress.<br>
<br>Cahill supported the new Adams&#150;McGuinness leadership's dropping of abstentionism in relation to the D&aacute;il in 1986, and later backed their peace process strategy. His main role in the peace process was immediately before the first IRA ceasefire in August 1994 and consisted of reassuring Irish-American supporters that republicans were not &#145;selling out&#146;. This task was considered so important that the taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, intervened directly with the White House to obtain a visa for him. Cahill's life can be summed up in a comment he made to his biographer: &#145;I was born in a united Ireland and I want to die in a united Ireland&#146;  (Anderson, 15). His wish was not granted. Following a brief illness he died from renal failure and pyelonephritis at his home, 30 Andersonstown Crescent, Belfast, on 23 July 2004. He was survived by his wife, Annie, and their seven children.<br>
