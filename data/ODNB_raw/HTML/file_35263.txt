<span class="headword">Novello,  Clara Anastasia</span> <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Countess Clara Anastasia Gigliucci]</span>  (1818&#150;1908), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 10 June 1818 at 240 Oxford Street, London, the fourth daughter of the music publisher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20377/', "Vincent Novello (1781&#150;1861)")</script> and his wife, Mary Sabilla Hehl (1789&#150;1854). Clara revealed musical talent at an early age. Her first official music lessons were at York with John Robinson, organist of the Catholic chapel in the city, where her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56611/', "(Joseph) Alfred Novello")</script> was already serving as an apprentice. On advice from Fran&ccedil;ois-Joseph F&eacute;tis, she was placed in the prestigious singing class of Alexandre Choron, at the Institution Royale de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris. During this period she also made the acquaintance of Rossini, who was impressed with the talents of the young soprano and frequently requested her to perform his music in later years.<br>
<br>With the political climate in France in upheaval, Clara Novello returned to England in 1830 and made her public d&eacute;but on 22 October 1832 at a benefit concert at the Theatre Royal, Windsor. By 1833 she had regular public engagements, notably at the Three Choirs festival (Worcester, 1833) and at the Philharmonic Society concerts. Other important performances from early in her career included those at Birmingham in 1837, of Mendelssohn's <span class="italic">St Paul</span> for the opening of the town hall, and, again for Mendelssohn, in Leipzig at the Gewandhaus concerts. There followed an extensive and successful tour of European cities, among them Berlin, Vienna, Dresden, and Weimar.<br>
<br>In 1838 Clara went to Milan to study operatic technique with the cavaliere de Micheroux; she made her Italian opera d&eacute;but in Padua on 6 July 1841 in Rossini's <span class="italic">Semiramide</span>. Rossini also selected her to perform in the Italian premi&egrave;re of his <span class="italic">Stabat mater</span>. During her engagement in 1842 to sing in the Italian city of Fermo, she met Count Giovanni Baptista Gigliucci, whom she married in London on 22 November 1843.<br>
<br>Following the custom of the time, after her marriage Clara put aside her career to live with the count in Italy, where she raised a family and assisted her husband in the fight for Italian independence. The couple had four children: Giovanni (1844&#150;1906), Porzia (1845&#150;1938), Mario (1847&#150;1937), and Valeria (1849&#150;1945). During the uprisings of 1848, however, the count lost his property and Clara willingly returned to the stage and resumed her professional life. Although she continued to sing sacred works, in this second half of her career she focused more frequently than before on the opera repertory, especially when singing on the continent, and her performances included <span class="italic">Semiramide</span> and <span class="italic">Robert le diable</span>, as well as <span class="italic">Rigoletto</span> at La Scala.<br>
<br>Clara Novello's career in England, however, was based largely on her performances of oratorio, which continued its general popularity over opera. She appeared at large choral festivals, including, again, the Three Choirs festival and the reopening of the Crystal Palace in 1854. She also sang before Queen Victoria in 1852 and on various other occasions. Writing in her diary on 13 May 1852, Queen Victoria noted, &#145;Madame Clara Novello, a native artist, has a very powerful, fine and clear voice and sings extremely well.&#146; In comparison with other British sopranos of her day, she maintained a strong following and a long-lasting popularity, and was especially loved for her performances of oratorio.<br>
<br>Although still popular, in 1860 Clara felt it time to close her career and withdraw from public performance; her final appearance was on 21 November 1860, at St James's Hall, London. The concert included selections from oratorio as well as opera and boasted an orchestra and choir of 250 performers. Clara and her husband retired to Rome and Fermo; Count Gigliucci died on 29 March 1893 and Clara died on 12 March 1908 at Rome.<br>
<br>Clara Novello's singing was considered agile, and contemporary accounts remarked on its fluidity and perfection. Writing to her brother Joseph Alfred Novello, Mendelssohn noted after the performance of <span class="italic">Messiah</span> in Leipzig in 1837, &#145;she possesses just those two qualities of which the public is particularly fond here, purity of intonation and a thoroughbred musical feeling&#146;  (Mackenzie-Grieve, 52).<br>
