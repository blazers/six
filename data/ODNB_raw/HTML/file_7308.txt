<span class="headword">Davy,  Adam</span>  (<em>fl. </em>early 14th cent.), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was the author of a verse account of five prophetic dreams (in Bodl. Oxf., MS Laud misc. 622, of the fourteenth century), and describes himself as &#145;Adam, the marshal&#146;, &#145;of Stratford-atte-bowe&#146; (London) twice, and once as &#145;Adam Davy&#146;. He claims that he is widely known, but no evidence of this fame has survived, and he is not otherwise known. Perhaps he was the marshal of a household. He says that he dreamt of a great knight, whose name is &#145;sir Edward &thorn;e kyng, Prince of Wales&#146;. It is usually assumed that this is Edward II, the only King Edward of the century to have actually been created prince of Wales (in 1301). If, however, the phrase is not meant as a precise title, the reference could be to Edward I or the young Edward III. In the vision, the king stands in front of the shrine of St Edward, with two knights on either side. They strike him fiercely with their swords, and he suffers the attack in silence, but is not wounded. When they are gone, four beams of light come from his ears, &#145;off diuers colours, red and white als [also?] hij were&#146;  (Davy, 12, l.32), and they spread far and wide in the country. This first dream took place on the Wednesday before the Decollation of John the Baptist (29 August). The second, on the Tuesday before All Saints' day (November 1), promises that the day will come when Edward will be chosen emperor of Christendom. He rides on an ass to Rome as a pilgrim, without hose and shoes; his shanks seem all blood red. In the third dream, on the Wednesday night before St Lucy's day (13 December), the pope crowns Edward emperor in Christendom&#151;May God give him victory over his enemies and the wicked Saracens. In the fourth, on &#145;wor&thorn;ing-ni<i>3</i>th&#146; (probably Sunday night), the dreamer goes into a chapel of Our Lady and sees Christ on the cross &#145;un-nail&#146; his hands and say that he wishes to go with the knight; he asks leave of his mother to accompany their loyal knight:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">in pilerinage he wil gon,<br>
</div>
<div>To bien awreke [avenged] of oure fon [foes].<br>
</div> (ibid., 14, ll.103&#150;4)</blockquote>The Virgin grants her son's request, and a voice urges Adam to make his dream known to the king. He sets off eastwards aided by light from heaven. In the final dream, on the Thursday before the feast of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary (8 September), the king stands before the high altar at Canterbury, all clothed in red, and the king is merry &#145;of &thorn;at blee [colour] red as blood&#146;  (ibid., 15, l.140). Adam is again urged to make the dream known to King Edward, and he says that he is doing this, not for reward but for fear of almighty God. Perhaps the description of Adam as &#145;a fanatical rhymer&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) is a little harsh. His prophetic visions have the combination of vividness and a tantalizingly enigmatic quality that is characteristic of the genre. On the face of it they might be urging the king to go on crusade, but their context and purpose remain mysterious. Adam was previously supposed to be the author of the other poems in the manuscript, but there is no evidence for this whatsoever.<br>
