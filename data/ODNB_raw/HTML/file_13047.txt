<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Herbert,  Sidney</span>, first Baron Herbert of Lea  (1810&#150;1861), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Richmond, Surrey, on 16 September 1810; he was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13026/', "George Augustus Herbert, eleventh earl of Pembroke (1759&#150;1827)")</script>, and his second wife, Catherine (1783&#150;1856), only daughter of Semyon, Count Vorontsov, formerly Russian ambassador at the court of St James, and long resident in England. He was educated at a preparatory school, Hall Place, Beaconsfield, and at Harrow School. He matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, on 17 May 1828. There he proved himself an elegant scholar, and was admired as a speaker at the Union Debating Society even by the side of W. E. Gladstone, Roundell Palmer, and others. In his final schools in November 1831 he went in for a pass degree. He was invited by the examiners after his first papers to seek honours, but declined, and received an honorary fourth class.<h2>
<a name="Earlypoliticalcareer"></a>Early political career</h2>As a youth Herbert was known for a marked grace of character and an elegant appearance which much impressed his contemporaries. His elder half-brother, Lord Pembroke, had married a Sicilian and lived abroad; so Sidney Herbert ran Wilton House, the family seat in Wiltshire, as if he was the earl, but was also able to stand for the Commons. In December 1832 he was elected for South Wiltshire as a tory and held the seat until ennobled in 1861 (he was twice opposed at general elections, in 1852 and 1857, leading the poll on both occasions). He confirmed his party credentials in his maiden speech on 20 June 1834 which opposed the removal of restrictions excluding dissenters from Oxford. He declined Sir Robert Peel's offer of becoming a government whip in December 1834, but accepted a secretaryship at the Board of Control in January 1835, holding the post until April 1835, when the government fell. In opposition between 1835 and 1841 Herbert established himself as an able speaker from the tory point of view, opposing, for example, the new system of penny postage. In 1841 Peel made him secretary to the Admiralty. Lord Haddington, the first lord, was in the Lords and Herbert was thus responsible for naval business in the Commons. He reformed the naval school at Greenwich and was preparing extensive changes&#151;including the retirement of 300 captains&#151;when Gladstone's resignation early in 1845 triggered a reshuffle. Herbert shrewdly declined the poisoned chalice of the Irish secretaryship and on 4 February was made secretary at war with a seat in the cabinet. Herbert was seen as a protectionist and when on 12 March 1845 Richard Cobden was making his motion for a select committee to inquire into the effect of protection upon the landed interest, Peel, who was sitting next to Herbert, said, &#145;You must answer this, for I cannot.&#146; In his reply Herbert expressed dislike of members coming to parliament &#145;whining for protection&#146;. Disraeli afterwards said that Peel had &#145;sent down his valet, a well-behaved person, to make it known that we are to have no whining here&#146;  (Morley, 1.318). When in November 1845 Peel first asked his cabinet to support suspension of the corn laws, Herbert was one of only three to support him. He did so believing that &#145;the fact is, the present law has failed&#146;  (Stanmore, 1.46). He was widely&#151;and inaccurately&#151;believed to have leaked news of the change of policy to the press through his close friend Caroline Norton. The calumny was repeated in George Meredith's <span class="italic">Diana of the Crossways</span> (1884). He defended Peel's policy in the Commons in the early months of 1846 and voted for repeal in June 1846. At the War Office he began the educational reforms which he was able later to continue and instituted an inquiry into reforming the militia. When Peel's government resigned on 29 June 1846, Herbert was marked as the leader of the younger Peelites, more reliable if also less able than his close contemporary, W. E. Gladstone.<h2>
<a name="MarriageandlifeinWiltshire"></a>Marriage and life in Wiltshire</h2>Out of office, on 12 August 1846 Herbert married Mary Elizabeth (1822&#150;1911) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53591/', "Herbert, (Mary) Elizabeth")</script>], daughter of General Charles Ashe &Agrave; Court (later &Agrave; Court Repington) of Amington Hall, Warwickshire, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gibbs. He had known his future wife as a child. When they married she was regarded as one of the most striking of society beauties. They had four sons and three daughters. At Wilton in the opposition years from 1846 to 1852 Herbert was an energetic reformer. He had already rebuilt the parish church (consecrated on 9 October 1845). He played a prominent role in the county, provided charitable assistance to the clergy and their families, and founded the Herbert Cottage Hospital at Charmouth (later moved to Bournemouth) under the care of a German protestant sisterhood. In this he and his wife were helped by Florence Nightingale, whose acquaintance they had made on a visit to Rome. The area of Donnybrook, on the outskirts of Dublin, was left him by Lord Fitzwilliam, and he expanded the estate, modernized the lease structure, and doubled the rent roll. Like Gladstone, with whom his friendship intensified in the 1840s, Herbert was much influenced by the Tractarian movement, and encouraged cathedral reform. He and his wife founded in 1849 the Female Emigration Fund, to promote assisted female emigration (Disraeli wrote of it: &#145;35,000 needle-women to be deported at &pound;5 a-piece&#146;; Stanmore, 1.199).<h2>
<a name="TheAberdeencoalitionandtheCrimeanWar"></a>The Aberdeen coalition and the Crimean War</h2>Herbert and other Peelites attempted to promote their views by purchasing in 1848 the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>; it was expensive to run and was sold to William Glover in 1854. Herbert also played some part in the establishment of the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> in 1855.<br>
<br>After Peel's death in 1850, Herbert and Gladstone, more than other leading Peelites, showed some signs of a <i>rapprochement</i> with the tory party, but this came to nothing. On the formation of the Peelite-led Aberdeen coalition in December 1852, Herbert again became secretary at war. The death of the duke of Wellington that year made army reform easier and Herbert anticipated continuing the moderately reforming pattern of his earlier tenure of the office. France, not Russia, was seen as Britain's most likely enemy. While in 1853 Britain drifted towards war with Russia in defence of the Ottoman empire, Herbert, with the other Peelites, urged caution. His semi-Russian parentage led to accusations of lack of patriotism.<br>
<br>The Crimean War, which began in March 1854, placed Herbert in a very difficult position. The secretary at war was subordinate to the secretary of state for war and the colonies (the duke of Newcastle) and was chiefly responsible for military finance. Herbert and others had enlarged these responsibilities in an <i>ad hoc</i> way to promote reform, and the absorption of the secretary of state in colonial duties meant that in peacetime the secretary at war often stood in for him. Herbert and Newcastle were both in the cabinet. Neither was a dominating politician, but Herbert was more so than Newcastle. The war quickly exposed the falsity of this arrangement. In the prolonged wrangle over the character of a new structure, Herbert defended the usefulness of his secretaryship but, eventually, proposed to the cabinet on 21 January 1855 a board (similar to the Admiralty board) to be presided over by the secretary of state. This was accepted by the cabinet but the government fell before any action was taken. Herbert's post was not filled when he left it and from that time was subsumed into the secretaryship for war, until its abolition in 1863.<br>
<br>Herbert had, therefore, little formal executive responsibility for the military conduct of the war, but, with Newcastle in the Lords, he was <i>de facto</i> spokesman for the army in the Commons and he was to an extent responsible for the supply of food, clothing, and shelter, and of medical services: precisely those areas most notorious for failure. Though Herbert ordered materials, the commissariat which supplied them was controlled by the Treasury, whose priority was the prevention of waste. An important reform achieved in part by Herbert was the transfer of the commissariat to the War Office, but this came too late. Herbert was aware of the defects of the medical support for the army and from the start of the war made strenuous and in part effective efforts to improve it. His boldest move was to send female nurses to assist in what were traditionally all-male hospitals.<br>
<br>On 15 October 1854 Herbert wrote to Florence Nightingale (already preparing an unofficial initiative) to ask her to take charge of a small group of female nurses sent to Scutari. She agreed and a legendary expedition was launched, Herbert exhorting the party in a farewell speech in his dining-room. In December he sent out a second party, led by Mary Stanley. This provoked a furious reaction from Florence Nightingale, and she offered her resignation. Herbert's cool and subtle handling of Miss Nightingale led to a satisfactory agreement, and both parties of nurses worked in the hospitals. Herbert was one of the few people Florence Nightingale respected; she kept his death day annually until her own.<br>
<br>Criticism of the government's handling of the war, and consequently of Herbert, came to a head in J. A. Roebuck's motion for a committee of inquiry into the state of the army before Sevastopol. Newcastle intended resignation and Aberdeen intended to replace him with Herbert, when Lord John Russell's resignation precipitated a crisis only ended by the passing of Roebuck's motion and the resignation of the cabinet on 30 January 1855. In Palmerston's succeeding government, Herbert was briefly, for a few days in February, colonial secretary (in the new arrangements of secretaryships); he resigned with Gladstone and Sir James Graham when Palmerston failed in his assurance that he would prevent the Roebuck inquiry. Herbert gave evidence to the inquiry on 9 May 1855 and favourably impressed it, later being exempted by Roebuck from its severest censures. Herbert's qualities of even-handed fairness and a determination that was quiet rather than dramatic equipped him well for peacetime office, but, as he himself sometimes sensed, equipped him insufficiently for the administrative complexities of the Crimean War.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsinpoliticsandearlydeath"></a>Final years in politics and early death</h2>Herbert now considered himself &#145;a member of the liberal party&#146;  (Stanmore, 2.81) and favoured, much more than Gladstone, accommodation between the Peelites and the whig-Liberals. While in opposition, from 1855 to 1859, he wrote quite frequent public letters, and a signed article on army reform for the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> (January 1859). When Palmerston formed his second government in June 1859, Herbert became secretary of state for war, with the task of consolidating that new office, of transferring the Indian army to the crown, of developing the volunteer movement, and of introducing rifled ordnance. A war with France was thought likely by some and, doubtless mindful of his experience in 1853&#150;4, Herbert planned not merely army reform but military expansion, with increased estimates and a programme of fortifications along the south coast of England and elsewhere. Though supported by Palmerston, he quickly found himself in sharp confrontation with Gladstone, now chancellor of the exchequer and intent on a reduction of government expenditure. The balance in cabinet swung away from Herbert, who offered his resignation in April 1860, and then away from Gladstone, who considered offering his. A compromise was found by financing through a loan. In addition to these disputes, Herbert organized the highly contentious war against China in 1859&#150;60.<br>
<br>By the autumn of 1860 Herbert's health had begun to break down; he was suffering from Bright's disease and diabetes, and perhaps renal disease. On 1 January 1861 he resigned his seat in the Commons (but not his secretaryship) and went to the Lords as Baron Herbert of Lea. Suffering also from pleurisy, he went with his family to Spa, resigning office on 16 July. He returned to Wilton House and died there on 2 August 1861 and was buried at Wilton. He was succeeded by his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13027/', "George Robert Charles Herbert")</script>, who in 1862 also succeeded as earl of Pembroke, the title of Herbert of Lea thus ceasing to be used. Herbert's widow converted to Roman Catholicism, to the consternation of her husband's Peelite friends.<br>
<br>Unusually, the whole of Herbert's official career had been spent in military offices. His policy in them had been that of common sense rather than systematic reform and in the confused politics of his time he had some success. He was sometimes regarded as a possible prime minister but it is unlikely that his gentlemanly nature equipped him for success in that office. Lord Houghton's view of his qualities&#151;&#145;that birth, wealth, grace, tact, and not too much principle&#146; equipped him &#145;to rule England&#146;  (Reid, 2.72)&#151;attributed to Herbert just that tough cunning which he in fact lacked.<br>
