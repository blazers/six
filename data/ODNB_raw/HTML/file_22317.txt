<span class="headword">Pitcairn,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1722, <em>d.</em> 1775), <span class="occ">marine officer</span>, was born in Dysart, Fife, Scotland, the son of the Revd David Pitcairn (1673&#150;1757), Presbyterian minister at Dysart, and Catherine Hamilton, daughter of William Hamilton of Wishaw; he was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22319/', "William Pitcairn")</script>, physician. He was baptized at St Serf's Church, Dysart, on 28 December 1722. He was commissioned lieutenant in Cornwall's 7th marines in 1746, being confirmed in that rank in 1755, and promoted captain on 8 June 1756. He served on the <i>Lancaster</i> in 1757 and on 19 April 1771 was promoted major in the Chatham division, Royal Marines. In 1743 he married Elizabeth (1724&#150;1809), daughter of Robert Dalrymple of Arnsfield, Dumfriesshire, and they had nine children. One of their five sons was <a href="#cosubject_22317">Robert Pitcairn [<i>see below</i>]</a>, another was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22315/', "David Pitcairn")</script>, physician, and one of their four daughters was Anne, mother of Sir John Campbell (1780&#150;1863).<br>
<br>John Pitcairn came to prominence in the American War of Independence and is very widely known in America today, though largely forgotten in Britain. In November 1774 he arrived in Boston with some 600 marines and was put in command of a battalion of 400 marines, part of a large army and navy force sent in response to growing patriot unrest. Pitcairn gained a reputation for piety, being a regular attender at Christ Church (the &#145;Old North Church&#146;) in Boston, and for both demanding strong discipline of, and dealing fairly with, his men.<br>
<br>The incident for which Pitcairn is famous or infamous occurred at Lexington on 19 April 1775. Pitcairn was second in command of a detachment of nearly 800 troops sent to destroy military stores at Concord, 16 miles from Boston. Patriot militiamen soon learned of the deployment of these troops, and Pitcairn was sent with six companies of light infantry to march ahead to secure the two bridges at Concord. Reaching Lexington Common, Pitcairn was confronted by militiamen. Pitcairn attempted to disarm and disperse the militiamen and his own testimony stresses that he ordered his troops not to fire. Despite his efforts, shooting broke out on both sides before Pitcairn rapidly brought it to a halt. Eight patriots had been killed and one Briton wounded and the exchange has passed into history as the first military engagement of the War of Independence. Pitcairn went on to destroy some of the arms held at Concord, but, leading his men back to their quarters, suffered with them at the hands of the now incensed militiamen. He lost his horse, which fled, wounded and allegedly carrying a brace of pistols. These were used by General Israel Putnam against the British in the ensuing war, and were later displayed at Lexington Historical Museum as the pistols which may have started the war. Severe doubt is now cast on the thesis that Pitcairn fired that first shot, and even on whether the pistols were his, since the crest they bear is not his, but the legend persists.<br>
<br>In June 1775 Pitcairn commanded his marines at the battle of Bunker Hill. There he led his troops valiantly but suffered wounds which proved mortal and he died on 17 June or early the next day at Prince Street, Boston. He was buried at Christ Church, Boston. His family later sought to repatriate his body and in 1791 remains described as his were interred at the church of St Bartholomew-the-Less, London, in a vault where his brother William and son David, both physicians, were interred. There have however been suggestions that, whether by design or mistake, the reinterred remains were not Pitcairn's but those of another British officer.<br>
<br>Early American historians vilified Pitcairn as the man who opened fire without justification on patriots. Later historians sought to paint a more balanced picture of the events at Lexington and it seems likely that a bystander may have fired the shot which prompted shooting on both sides. Later historians drew attention to Pitcairn's admirable personal qualities.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22317"></a><span class="headword">Robert Pitcairn</span>  (1752&#150;1770?)<span class="occ"></span>, John's son, was born on 6 May 1752 in the parish of Burntisland, Fife, and baptized there on 12 May that year. He served on the <i>Emerald</i>, after which, on 8 July 1766, he was entered as a midshipman on board the <i>Swallow</i>, a sixth-rate sloop of fourteen guns then fitting out for a voyage of discovery under Captain Philip Carteret. According to the <i>Swallow</i>'s pay book he was then nineteen. This information, which would put his birth date back to 1746/1747, is now thought to be wrong. <i>Swallow</i>'s course in the Pacific Ocean was more southerly than that of any other navigator to date, but a consequence of this was that she passed scarcely any land. This made the discoveries of the voyage few in number and made provisioning difficult. Carteret was reduced to promising a prize to the sailor who should sight land. This went to Pitcairn, who sighted an island, which was the most important discovery of that part of Carteret's voyage. On Thursday 2 July 1767 ship's time (1 July civil time) the <i>Swallow</i> sighted an island, according to their reckoning, in latitude 25&deg;02' S and longitude 133&deg;21' W.<blockquote>The 2<sup>d</sup> of July we made Pitcairn's Island, which I so called, after the name of the first person who discover'd it, Mr Pitcairn, a young gentleman and midshipman on board &hellip; [T]he next day [the sighted land] prouved to be a small high uninhabited island not above 4 or 5 miles round, is scarce better than a large rock in the Ocean. (Carteret, 149&#150;50)</blockquote>The ship was unable to land on the island, which is of volcanic origin and whose high cliffs descend precipitously into the sea so Pitcairn never set foot on the island which bears his name.<br>
<br>The <i>Swallow</i> paid off in May 1769 and Pitcairn appears to have joined the <i>Aurora</i>, a fifth-rate vessel of thirty-two guns, under Captain Thomas Lee, which sailed from England on 30 September. After touching at the Cape of Good Hope she was never heard of again, and it is thought that she went down in a cyclone near Mauritius in January or February 1770. Pitcairn's name does not appear in her pay book, but it is quite possible that he was entered very shortly before she sailed and was not reported to the Admiralty, or that he was supernumerary. Carteret stated that Pitcairn was lost in the <i>Aurora</i> in his published journal of the voyage of the <i>Swallow</i>. The island which Pitcairn discovered could not afterwards be found, the reported latitude and longitude being wrong, but it is generally identified with the island at latitude 25&deg;04' S and 130&deg;16' W, where the mutineers of the <i>Bounty</i> landed in 1789, and where they and their survivors settled.<br>
