<span class="headword">Leake,  Stephen  Martin</span>  (1826&#150;1893), <span class="occ">legal writer</span>, was born in London on 19 March 1826, the eldest son of Stephen Ralph Martin Leake (1782&#150;1865), assistant secretary to the Treasury, and his wife, Georgiana, daughter of Captain George Stevens. The family was seated at Thorpe Hall, near Colchester, Essex, and at Marshalls in High Cross, Ware, Hertfordshire. Leake's grandfather John Leake was a bencher of the Middle Temple, and was said at the time of his death in 1862 to be the senior barrister in England by date of call. John was a grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16241/', "Stephen Martin Leake (1702&#150;1773)")</script>, Garter king of arms.<br>
<br>Stephen Leake attended King's College School, and went on to Cambridge in 1844 as a pensioner at St John's College. He was placed as twentieth wrangler in the mathematical tripos in 1848, when he took his BA degree. On graduation he was admitted to the Middle Temple, and he was called to the bar five years later in 1853, reading as a pupil in the chambers of the eminent special pleader, Edward Bullen. He became a member of the home circuit, and attended the Hertfordshire and Essex sessions. On 24 September 1859 he married Isabella 
    (or Isabel; <i>d</i>. 1924)
  , daughter of William Plunkett, a conveyancing counsel.<br>
<br>Leake (or Martin(-)Leake, as he was sometimes called) practised for about ten years from various sets of chambers in the Temple, but his reputation was chiefly built on his legal writing. His first work, for which he is still best remembered, was <span class="italic">Precedents of Pleadings in Common Law</span>; it was compiled in collaboration with Bullen and published in 1860. Bullen and Leake, whose work reached a twelfth edition by 1975, were household names for all barristers for well over a century.<br>
<br>However, Leake's literary career was to be longer and more distinguished than Bullen's. Belying the image of crabbed pedantry which had traditionally attached to experts on pleading, he was a prominent member of the Juridical Society, founded in the 1850s to promote the scientific study of law. In a paper which he delivered to the society in 1857 he explored the possibility of identifying universal fundamental principles of property law, comparing English and Roman law. Three years later he presented a paper to the Social Science Association on &#145;The formal science of law&#146;. His inclinations were therefore already turning to legal scholarship when in 1863, worried by increasing deafness, he made the decision to leave practice and retire to his father's seat in Hertfordshire. There he became a county magistrate and made use of the comparative leisure of country life to compose lucid and methodical treatises on the law. His <span class="italic">Principles of the Law of Contracts</span> (1867) was the first scientific treatise on what was soon to become a core subject in the legal curriculum; it was also the first treatise to identify and analyse some recently developed doctrines, such as vitiation by mistake. The book was to exercise a beneficial effect on the academic legal literature of the next generation; it was the basis of an American textbook by W. A. Keener, published in 1891, and its influence in English universities was acknowledged by Sir William Anson.<br>
<br>Leake was inspired by the codification movement, and in 1868 he responded to the general invitation from Lord Cranworth's commission of 1866 by producing <span class="italic">A Scheme of a Digest of Law, with a Specimen Digest of the Law of Bills of Exchange</span>. The guiding principle of his scheme was that &#145;the contents might be recognized intuitively as standing in their proper relations, so that the inquirer might be guided to any point by his sense of order only&#146;. He described the construction of a digest as &#145;a translation of the law from an historical to a systematic or scientific form&#146;, though (in contrast with a code) the cases from which it was derived would be cited. The method was essentially that adopted by Pollock and Chalmers in their respective digests of the law of partnership, bills of exchange, and the sale of goods, each of which resulted in codifying legislation.<br>
<br>Leake spent his remaining years preparing digests of the common law according to his scheme, beginning with the land law. His <span class="italic">Elementary Digest of the Law of Property in Land</span> (1874) was followed by <span class="italic">A Digest of the Law of Uses and Profits of Land</span> (1888), which (according to the half-title) was conceived as the third part of his <span class="italic">Digest of the Law of Property</span>. This last part was not concerned with uses and trusts, but with &#145;uses of land&#146; in the lay sense; two further parts were planned but did not materialize. His <span class="italic">Elementary Digest of the Law of Contracts</span>, which appeared in 1878, was a revised edition of <span class="italic">Principles</span> and was designed to fit into the same scheme. The uncompleted works on real property, though revised in a posthumous second edition of 1909, made no particular impact; the solution to the problem of the land law was to be fundamental reform rather than codification. On the other hand, the treatise on contracts reached an eighth edition in 1931 and was still sometimes consulted throughout the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Leake died at Ware, Hertfordshire, on 7 March 1893, and was buried at Thorpe-le-Soken, Essex. He was survived by his wife, six sons, and two daughters. The eldest son, Stephen (1861&#150;1940), was a co-editor of two editions of <span class="italic">Precedents of Pleadings in the Common Law</span>, and a Hertfordshire magistrate. The fifth son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70604/', "Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Martin-Leake (1874&#150;1953)")</script>, was twice awarded the Victoria Cross.<br>
