<span class="headword">Hill,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1817), <span class="occ">actor and singer</span>, was believed to be a native of Kidderminster, Worcestershire. He lost his father when he was four and was adopted and educated by his maternal uncle, John Hale (<i>d</i>. 1782), rector of Albrighton, Shropshire. On the death of that uncle, Hill was taken to another uncle in Wolverhampton, who apprenticed him to a painter when he was sixteen.<br>
<br>After a short visit to London, Hill went to Bristol, where he met William Dimond, the manager of the theatres there and at Bath. Although Dimond had no need for extra performers, Hill persuaded him to allow him to perform for a single night. This first performance was as Belville in the comic opera <span class="italic">Rosina</span>, by Frances Brooke, but the date and place are unclear; according to John Roach's <span class="italic">Authentic Memoirs</span> and Thomas Gilliland's <span class="italic">Dramatic Mirror</span>, it occurred at Bristol in June 1796, but John Genest's <span class="italic">Some Account of the English Stage</span> says 1 October 1796 at Bath. Hill so impressed Dimond on his d&eacute;but that he was awarded a five-year contract. Under the recommendation of Ann Selina Storace, Hill studied under Mr Richards, the leader of the band at the Bath theatre, and also under Xamenes, and finally with Venanzio Rauzzini.<br>
<br>After two years Hill was given permission to go to London and perform at Covent Garden in the 1798&#150;9 season for &pound;5 per week. His first performance in London was as Edwin in Leonard MacNally's comic opera <span class="italic">Robin Hood</span>, and he went on to play more than twenty-five roles at Covent Garden over the next eight years, eventually securing a salary of &pound;12 per week. Perhaps his most successful role was as the original Sir Edward in Thomas Knight's comic opera <span class="italic">The Turnpike Gate</span>, which had twenty-seven performances in the 1799&#150;1800 season. Hill's career in London ended at the end of the 1805&#150;6 season, when he left Covent Garden as a result of some &#145;fancied&#146; injury to his pride and is said to have gone to perform &#145;in the country&#146;  (Gilliland, 2.784).<br>
<br>Although Hill never received huge accolades as a performer, he was described in the <span class="italic">Authentic Memoirs</span> as attractive, &#145;with a pleasing figure&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>), and Gilliland made the following observation: &#145;as a performer little can be said in his favour, but as a singer he is entitled to our praise; and with a due attention to his vocal studies, he might stand very high in the profession&#146;  (Gilliland, 2.784). He was apparently popular with the ladies, though his enjoyment of pleasurable pursuits was probably detrimental to his career.<br>
<br>It is not known when or to whom Hill was married, but a Mr and Mrs Hill performed at Edinburgh in 1810&#150;11 and, according to the <span class="italic">Biographical Dictionary of Actors</span>, James Hill was the same man who, with his wife, joined a company headed by W. Adamson in Jamaica in 1816. According to the same source, Hill was involved with concerts there until his death at Mount Bay, Jamaica, on 27 June 1817, though his death was not registered in the <span class="italic">Royal Gazette</span> in Jamaica for 1817. Administration of his estate was granted to his brother Charles Hill, a bachelor and doctor.<br>
