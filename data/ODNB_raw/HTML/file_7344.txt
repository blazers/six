<span class="headword">Dawson,  Benjamin</span>  (1729&#150;1814), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and philologist</span>, was born in Halifax, the sixth of the seven sons of Eli Dawson (<i>d</i>. 1744), Presbyterian minister of Morley, Yorkshire, and his wife, Alice Taylor. He and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7356/', "Thomas Dawson (c.1725&#150;1782)")</script>, physician, entered the nonconformist academy at Kendal as exhibitioners of the London Presbyterian Board in 1746, and were there taught by Caleb Rotheram. In November 1748 he went to Glasgow University, where he and his brothers Thomas, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7342/', "Abraham Dawson (1713?&#150;1789)")</script>, biblical scholar, and Joseph studied as scholars on Dr Williams's foundation. He graduated MA in 1750, and defended a thesis, <span class="italic">De summo bono</span>, on taking his degree. His thesis, an able disquisition on the relationship between God and human good, was published for the university by the Foulis brothers in 1750.<br>
<br>Dawson was Presbyterian minister at Leek, Staffordshire, in 1754, before moving to Congleton, Cheshire, where he worked as a teacher. He moved from Congleton in 1757 in order to become assistant minister at St Thomas's Presbyterian Church, Southwark. His elder brother Thomas had conformed to the Church of England, and Benjamin followed suit in 1758, the same year that he took the degree of LLD at Glasgow. Their brother Abraham had already conformed and served as rector of Ringsfield, Suffolk, from 1754 until 1789. Obadiah, a merchant in Leeds, was the only brother to remain a dissenter; of the others, Samuel taught at a school, Eli served in the West Indies, and Joseph became rector of Paull, near Hull. Shortly after conforming, Benjamin became rector of Burgh, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, in 1760, a living he held until his death. This did not prevent him from maintaining good relations with dissenters, and in 1763 he accompanied, as his private tutor, Sir Benjamin Ibbetson, a young baronet from Leeds, to Warrington Academy, where Dawson became a member of the active literary society around John Aikin. On 6 June 1776 he married Mary Halsey (1722/3&#150;1803) at Burgh.<br>
<br>All but one of Dawson's works were published after he conformed to the established church. He wrote two essays in defence of Edmund Law's enunciation of the mortalist thesis that the soul slept in the interval between death and the resurrection into eternal life, of which the first appeared in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> in 1758, and the second in the <span class="italic">Grand Magazine</span> in 1758. These were later reprinted as an appendix to <span class="italic">An Illustration of Several Texts of Scripture, Particularly those in which the Logos occurs</span>, which was published by Andrew Millar in 1765. This publication put into print the eight sermons on the Anglican elucidation of trinitarian doctrine which Dawson had preached in 1764 and 1765 on Lady Moyer's foundation. While he was careful not to accuse Arians, Socinians, and Sabellians of being less than Christians, Dawson was determined to demonstrate the flaws in their arguments, thus distancing himself from the Arianism in which he had been reared as a liberal Presbyterian. The lectures were more critical of Arianism than of other anti-trinitarian systems, and he was especially concerned to demonstrate the scriptural and apostolic basis of the Church of England's teaching on the matter. Satisfied though he was of clearing himself from orthodox suspicions, it is notable that a prominent mouthpiece of rational dissent, the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, declared in 1810 that, while successful in his assault on Arianism, Dawson's account was, &#145;in truth, completely Unitarian&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, 1810, 325).<br>
<br>Although the Lady Moyer's sermons were intended to defend the first of the church's <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, Dawson quickly proved himself an ally in the campaign to repeal Anglican subscription to the authority of the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. He proved a particularly astute defender of Francis Blackburne's major contribution to the campaign, <span class="italic">The Confessional</span> (1767); Blackburne thought him &#145;an incomparable writer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, 1810, 325). Most of the several pamphlets he devoted to the issue criticized point by point the writings produced by the defenders of subscription, notably those by Thomas Rutherforth, John Rotherham, Gloucester Ridley, and Thomas Balguy. Dawson began his campaign with <span class="italic">An Examination of an Essay on Establishments in Religion</span> (1767), and brought it to an end in <span class="italic">A Letter to the Clergy of the Archdeaconry of Winchester</span> (1773). The basis of his critique can be found in a pivotal remark in <span class="italic">An Answer to Letters Concerning Established Confessions of Faith</span> (1769), when he protested that churchmen ought not to subject &#145;the Gospel, the blessed Gospel of light and truth, to the institutions of fallible man&#146;  (p. 36). His was an ultra-protestant position; he argued that the doctrine of men such as Balguy would bring the Church of England &#145;<i>directly</i> to <i>Popery</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Letter to the Clergy</span>, 43). Dawson's close association with Blackburne troubled Joseph Priestley, who despised him for having conformed to a church to whose articles he had readily subscribed, paradoxically making of him, as Priestley observed in a letter to Theophilus Lindsey in April 1772, a &#145;man &hellip; living in every contradiction to every principle of the <span class="italic">Confessional</span>&#146;. He cited Dawson's brother Obadiah, a member of Priestley's congregation, as saying, &#145;I do not know what my brother meant by attacking you, but I know he hates the Dissenters&#146;. In the same letter Priestley boldly stated, &#145;I am afraid his case is that of one who hates the light because his deeds are evil&#146;  (Rutt, 1.168). Whatever the level of personal antagonism between Dawson and Priestley, Dawson remained on good terms with many dissenters, who appreciated his help in the campaign to alter the terms of subscription required by the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> in 1779.<br>
<br>Dawson was a firm moralist, as is apparent in his short work <span class="italic">Some Assistance Offered to Parents with Respect to the Religious Education of their Children</span> (1759). This was confirmed in <span class="italic">National Depravity the Cause and Mark of Divine Judgement upon a Land</span> (Ipswich, 1780), a fast sermon which he had preached in February 1780 and which he dedicated to Blackburne, &#145;the Firm, Strenuous, and Consistent Assertor of Religious Freedom&#146;. The sermon espoused an Anglican version of the politics of rational dissent: the country was being judged for sinning against its &#145;superior principles, both in our Religious and Civil Constitution&#146;. The war with America was described as an &#145;unhappy, <i>unnatural</i> contest with our <i>fellow-subjects</i>&#146;, hurtful to trade and commerce and, ultimately, to the British constitution; it was, therefore, the duty of Christians to &#145;throw our <i>Mite</i> of Virtue and Piety, as of Taxes, into the public treasure&#146;  (<span class="italic">National Depravity</span>, 14, 16, 21). The sermon he preached as part of the general thanksgiving for the restoration of George III's health in 1789 voiced his conviction that the political constitution had to be preserved, because &#145;The virtues and vices, the genius, manners, and customs, and also the ease and security of a people, are principally derived hence&#146;  (Dawson, <span class="italic">The Benefits of Civil Government, a Ground of Praise to God</span>, 1789, 7).<br>
<br>In his later years Dawson turned from theology and politico-theology to the fashionable study of language. In 1797 he published at Ipswich <span class="italic">Prolepsis philologiae Anglicanae, or, A Plan of a Philological and Synonymical Dictionary</span>. He saw synonyms as being introduced into languages in order to register the &#145;increase and refinement of ideas&#146;; so it was that the conventional method of dictionaries explaining one word by another was &#145;erroneous&#146;: mathematical exactness in definition would only arise by giving the &#145;<i>general</i>&#146; and &#145;<i>special</i>&#146; import of a word  (pp. 9, 34&#150;5, 42). Philology was to be based on the same footing as entomology, ornithology, and botany. He was interested in the literal rather than the figurative use of a word: this was the proper province of the philologist. The <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span> of 1810 spoke highly of the <span class="italic">Prolepsis</span>, describing it as &#145;a work of great promise, which it is greatly to be wished that the author may live to finish&#146;, and attributing its apparent lack of success to its forbidding Latin title. Dawson published the first instalment of his dictionary at Ipswich in 1806, but his <span class="italic">Philologia Anglicana, or, A Philological and Synonymical Dictionary of the English Language</span> never got beyond &#145;A&#150;Adornment&#146;. Its style owed much to the example of Johnson's <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>, complete with citations from English authorities. The first entry, &#145;A/An&#146;, gave examples from Johnson, Dryden, and Addison, and, significantly for a theologian such as Dawson, from the liberal theologian Richard Watson on Jesus, and Hobbes on the Antichrist. His dictionary plainly served broad educational purposes.<br>
<br>Dawson never produced another volume, and he died at his rectory in Burgh, where he had performed his duties as rector with exemplary care for fifty-four years, on 15 June 1814. He was buried in the chancel of his church on 21 June next to his wife, who had died on 22 June 1803.<br>
