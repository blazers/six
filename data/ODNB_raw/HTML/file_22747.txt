<span class="headword">Price,  David</span>  (1790&#150;1854), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, entered the navy in January 1801 on board the <i>Ardent</i>, with Captain Thomas Bertie, and was present in the battle of Copenhagen on 2 April. He was afterwards in the <i>Blenheim</i>, which, on the renewal of the war in 1803, went out to the West Indies. In 1805 he was in the <i>Centaur</i> with Sir Samuel Hood, and again in 1806, being present in the action off Rochefort on 25 September, and at the capture of the Russian battleship <i>Sevolod</i> on 26 August 1808. In April 1809 he was appointed acting lieutenant of the <i>Ardent</i>, and during the following summer was twice captured by the Danes, once while in command of a watering party, and again in a prize which was wrecked; each time, however, he was soon released. The confirmation of his rank as lieutenant was dated 28 September 1809. He continued in the <i>Ardent</i> until February 1811, when he was appointed to the brig <i>Hawk</i>, with Captain Henry Bourchier, employed on the north coast of France. On 19 August the <i>Hawk</i> drove four armed vessels and a convoy of fifteen merchantships on shore near Barfleur. Price, in command of the boats, was sent in to finish the work, and succeeded in bringing out an armed brig and three store-ships; the others were lying over on their sides, completely bilged.<br>
<br>Two months later, on 21 October, Price was severely wounded in an unsuccessful attempt to cut two brigs out of Barfleur harbour. It was nearly a year before he was able to serve again; in September 1812 he was appointed to the <i>Mulgrave</i> (74 guns) off Cherbourg. In January 1813 he joined his old captain, Bourchier, in the <i>San Josef</i>, carrying the flag of Sir Richard King off Toulon. On 6 December he was promoted to command the bomb-vessel <i>Volcano</i>, which he took out in the summer of 1814 to the coast of North America. In the same year he engaged in the operations in the Potomac, against Baltimore, and at New Orleans, where, on 24 December, he was severely wounded in the thigh. On his return to England Price was advanced to post rank on 13 June 1815. From 1834 to 1838 he commanded the <i>Portland</i> in the Mediterranean, during which time his services to the Greek government won him the order of the Redeemer of Greece, as well as complimentary letters from Sir Edmund Lyons.<br>
<br>For the next six years Price lived in Brecknockshire, for which county he was a JP. In 1846 he married Elizabeth, daughter of John Taylor, and niece of Admiral William Taylor. In 1846 he was made superintendent of Sheerness Dockyard, where he continued until promoted rear-admiral on 6 November 1850. In August 1853 he was appointed commander-in-chief in the Pacific, and arrived on the station shortly before the declaration of war with Russia. Price proved to be a tactful and courteous joint commander-in-chief, but it appears that the responsibilities of wartime command, and the difficulty of working with his French colleague, weighed heavily on him, and he was susceptible to any advice. The allies moved slowly across the Pacific, spending a considerable period in the Marquesas Islands, and at Honolulu, where they worked to reduce the influence of the Americans. In July 1854 the two squadrons, English and French, met at Honolulu, and on 25 July sailed to search for two Russian frigates, which were reported to be at sea. They found the frigates dismantled at Petropavlovsk; but, on the morning of the attack, 30 August 1854, Price shot himself with a pistol, and died a few hours later. Opinion has long been divided as to whether Price deliberately shot himself, or was the victim of a terrible accident. On balance, the evidence of those closest to him, including the chaplain, to whom he confessed his &#145;crime&#146;, favours the suicide verdict. Sir Frederick Nicolson succeeded to the command, but the attack was postponed until 4 September, when it met with a decisive repulse. On 1 September Price was buried on shore, beneath a tree, on which the letters &#145;D. P.&#146; were rudely cut with a knife.<br>
<br>Price, a brave and successful junior officer, had suffered severe wounds. Long years of peacetime service and half pay left him ill prepared for the scale of his task in the Pacific; and, when he was confronted with the problems imposed by an unnecessarily complex command structure, and the prospect of going, once again, under fire while engaging shore batteries, his resolve apparently collapsed. As an isolated incident the suicide of a British admiral on the point of action might seem remarkable; but Price's career had done nothing to prepare him for this situation, while his experience had given him every reason to dread the prospect.<br>
