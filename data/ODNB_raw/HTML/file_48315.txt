<span class="headword">Powderham <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Exeter, Poydras, Tanner]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1318), <span class="occ">impostor</span>, was the son of an Exeter tanner who attained notoriety by treasonably claiming to be the rightful king of England in 1318. Records are meagre: on 20 July William Montagu, the king's steward, was ordered to take him (under the name of John Exeter) from Northampton gaol for trial. All further information comes from chronicle sources, which show a reasonable correspondence of detail.<br>
<br>Powderham, who took his name from a hamlet about 5&frac12; miles south of Exeter, first made his claim in Oxford in June 1318. Variously described as <i>literatus</i> or <i>scriptor</i>, perhaps attracted from Exeter to make his living as a scribe on the fringes of Oxford's university community, he went to the King's Hall there, which had recently been granted to the Carmelites, and ordered them to leave his house, claiming to be the true heir of Edward I. His claim was confused, being reported both as a claim to be Edward II's brother, and as a claim to be the real Edward II, changed in the cradle following injury through the negligence of his nurse. He was first imprisoned in the Bocardo in Oxford, then in Northampton. The king treated him with derision, but the queen and the magnates took him seriously in the tense political situation of 1317&#150;18. A trial was held before Montagu; Powderham's parents were brought from Exeter and swore he was their son; he then allegedly confessed to association with the devil, who he said had persuaded him to make the claim; and he was executed by hanging about 24 July. Franciscan and Dominican writers used the episode as an excuse to preach on the vanity of dreams and on false prophets, but in general chroniclers were sceptical about witchcraft, and the canon of Bridlington considered him weak in the head.<br>
<br>The Lanercost chronicler raised the question of whether Powderham was manipulated by others. His advent certainly came at a delicate political time. England hovered on the edge of civil war in 1317 and early 1318, with relations between Edward and Thomas of Lancaster at their lowest ebb. However, mediation intensified in June and July 1318, largely due to the need to face the Scots, who had retaken Berwick in April. By 23 June the first set of talks had failed, but on 11 and again on 18 July the archbishop of Canterbury expected success. It is exactly in these months that the impostor appeared. Agreement was finally reached on 29 July, just after his execution. If he was, as most chronicle reports seem to suggest, a foolish, half-educated man, who had convinced himself that the devil came to him in dreams, he might easily be manipulated, but if so, by whom? The king's favourites did not particularly want a peace settlement with Lancaster if it included a confirmation of the ordinances, but it is not easy to see how an attack on the king's position would help them, unless they hoped to attribute the attack to Lancaster. It is conceivable that Lancaster or some of his supporters might encourage an attack on the king if they thought it would weaken him, and bring reconciliation on Lancaster's terms. There is in fact no evidence that either side had any connection with Powderham, nor of what effect his appearance had on negotiations. The impostor was an embarrassment to Edward, but it is unlikely that anyone saw the deposition of Edward as a practical possibility at this time, and, whatever Edward's faults, it is highly doubtful that any manipulator would seriously think that a man whose background appears to have been an upbringing in an Exeter craft family, and who believed he was in contact with the devil, would be more suitable. Edward's initial reaction, to see him as a court jester, might well have been the right one in normal times.<br>
