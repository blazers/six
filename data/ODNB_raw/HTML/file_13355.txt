<span class="headword">Hinton, Sir  John</span>  (1603?&#150;1682), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in London. He had at least three brothers, all of whom supported the crown during the civil war. On 10 April 1633, aged thirty, he entered Leiden University, where he probably proceeded MD. He presented himself as a practitioner of midwifery at the censor's board of the College of Physicians, London, on 6 February 1634; but as he had not been engaged in practice for the statutable period of four years, was not examined. On 7 November 1640 Hinton again appeared at the college, and presented letters from the earl of Dorchester, testifying that he had been appointed physician to the queen. After the outbreak of the civil war Hinton busied himself in promoting a petition to the Long Parliament styled &#145;The inns of court peticion for peace&#146;, for which he was repeatedly examined, as he alleges, by the House of Commons, and before long &#145;was forced to fly from my house and family, whereupon they immediatly plundered mee to the losse of above one thousand pound, and my wife and children were left in very bad condition &hellip;&#146;  (Hinton, 7). There is no mention of any such examination in the <span class="italic">Journals</span> of the House of Commons. Hinton joined the king at York, marched with the army to Beverley, Hull, and Nottingham, and was present at the battle of Edgehill (1642). After accompanying the king to Oxford, he was there created MD on 1 November 1642, and was appointed physician-in-ordinary to Prince Charles. By the king's command he attended the queen to Exeter, where she gave birth in 1644 to the Princess Henrietta; afterwards he saw the queen into Cornwall and safely embarked for France.<br>
<br>In 1646 Hinton was living at Fulwood's Rents, London, having been in Exeter when it was taken by Sir Thomas Fairfax. Hinton was examined before the council of state on 27 August 1649. He appears to have lived for some time at The Hague in the suite of Charles II. On his return to London he was arrested and frequently examined. He claimed that he was on one occasion interrogated by Cromwell, who, he said, &#145;swore by the liveing God, hee would wrack every veine in my heart if I did not discover the designes against him&#146;  (Hinton, 27&#150;8). Fortunately for Hinton, &#145;by the means and intercession of some zealous women, my patients&#146;, he was freed. According to his own account, a close watch was, however, kept on him until the Restoration.<br>
<br>Hinton was certainly in London in July 1655, and, although under suspicion, was allowed to remain there on account of his patients. After the Restoration he was appointed physician-in-ordinary to the king and queen, a position he held until 1673, and in December 1664 was admitted an honorary fellow of the College of Physicians. &#145;At the latter end of the plague&#146; (1665) he was knighted, in recognition of his having procured a private advance of money for the duke of Albemarle to pay the army. In 1672 he purchased fee farms from the crown. In 1679 he presented a memorial to the king in which he set out, in the form of an autobiography, the losses he had incurred during the civil war and afterwards, and praying that such might be made good either to him or his children. One hundred copies of these <span class="italic">Memoires</span> were printed from the original manuscript in 1814. Hinton lived in the parish of St Bride, London, but before his death moved to the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields. He must have died in poverty during the autumn of 1682, for on 14 November of that year administration of his estate was granted to Humphrey Weld (1612&#150;1685), a principal creditor.<br>
