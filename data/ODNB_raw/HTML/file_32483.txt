<span class="headword">Cokayne <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Adams]</span>,  George Edward</span>  (1825&#150;1911), <span class="occ">genealogist</span>, born at 64 Russell Square, London, on 29 April 1825, was the fourth son and youngest child (in a family of eight) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/139/', "William Adams (1772&#150;1851), LLD")</script>, of Thorpe, Surrey, advocate in Doctors' Commons, and his wife, the Hon. Mary Anne (<i>d</i>. 1873), daughter of William Cockayne and niece and coheir of Borlase Cockayne, sixth and last Viscount Cullen. His mother belonged to the well-known family of Cokayne&#151;the name was variously spelt Cockayne and Cokayne&#151;of Rushton Hall, Northamptonshire. On 15 August 1873 Adams assumed the name and arms of Cokayne by royal warrant in accordance with his mother's testamentary directions. After private education owing to delicate health, he went to Oxford, matriculating from Exeter College on 6 June 1844. He graduated BA in 1848 and proceeded MA in 1852. He was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn on 16 January 1850, and was called to the bar on 30 April 1853. On 2 December 1856 he married Mary Dorothea, third and youngest daughter of George Henry Gibbs of Aldenham Park, Hertfordshire, and sister of Henry Hucks Gibbs (afterwards Lord Aldenham). She predeceased him on 11 March 1906. They had eight children, of whom two sons and two daughters survived them. Entering the College of Arms in 1859, he held successively the offices of Rouge Dragon pursuivant-of-arms (1859&#150;70) and Lancaster herald (1870&#150;82). In his heraldic capacity Cokayne was attached to the Garter missions to Portugal (1865), Russia (1867), Italy (1868), Spain (1881), and Saxony (1882). Appointed Norroy king of arms in 1882, he succeeded to the post of Clarenceux king of arms in 1894. He was an active member of the Society of Antiquaries, being elected fellow on 22 February 1866. He died of a heart attack at his residence, Exeter House, Roehampton, on 6 August 1911, and was buried at Putney Vale.<br>
<br>Cokayne was modest, industrious, and scholarly, with a great kindness and courtesy of manner. He published much on genealogy and the last part of his life was devoted to his major works, <span class="italic">The Complete Peerage</span> (8 vols., 1887&#150;98; 2nd edn, rev. and enlarged by V. Gibbs and others, 13 vols., 1910&#150;59), and <span class="italic">The Complete Baronetage</span> (5 vols., 1900&#150;06; index vol., 1909). <span class="italic">The Complete Peerage</span> was (and is) unique in that it gave a full historical and genealogical account of all peerages created in the whole of the British Isles (including Ireland) from the conquest to the date of publication. This was unlike earlier peerages, which covered only those titles extant or extinct at the time of writing or dealt only with one country&#151;England or Ireland, for example&#151;or both. And whereas earlier works usually gave full (and often inaccurate) accounts of the whole family, &#145;G.E.C.&#146; described the public life of the holders of the title and their direct heirs only, and, so far as he could, used original sources for his information. <span class="italic">The Complete Peerage</span> therefore quickly won the author general recognition as a genealogist of the first authority, and both it and the <span class="italic">Baronetage</span> (written on similar principles) have taken their place as primary authorities on their subjects.<br>
