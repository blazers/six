<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Christofas <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Goodwin]</span>, Sir  Kenneth Cavendish</span>  (1917&#150;1992), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born at Kismet, Highcroft Gardens, Golders Green, Middlesex, on 18 August 1917, the only son of Edward Julius Goodwin (<i>d</i>. 1917/18), commercial agent and a private in 370 labour company, and his wife, Lillian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Levinson. His father died after being gassed in the trenches during the First World War, and his mother subsequently married Alexander Christofas, a Greek aristocrat and marine lawyer, who took British citizenship; Kenneth took his stepfather's name. On 1 May 1948 he married Jessica Laura Sparshott (<i>b</i>. 1917/18), daughter of Tom Sparshott, marine engineer, of London; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>Christofas was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and University College, London, where he took a degree in classics and economics. On the outbreak of the Second World War he was commissioned into the Queen's Own Royal West Kent regiment and went with the British expeditionary force to France. His later military career was principally on the staff. He was appointed MBE and a member of the order of Polonia Restituta in 1944, and was among the select band who reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel while still in their twenties. After the war he thought about staying on in the army but instead in December 1948 joined the foreign service under the scheme for former officer direct entrants. There Europe became his specialization, with spells in the European departments at home and the Rome embassy, and the first of several assignments in Brussels. In the intervals he broadened his horizons on secondment to the Commonwealth Relations Office as economic counsellor in Lagos and to the Colonial Office as head of the economic department.<br>
<br>In 1969 Christofas was appointed CMG and returned to Brussels as deputy head of the UK delegation to the EC. He had been hand-picked to play a key role in any negotiations for British entry. When the Heath government opened negotiations in 1970 Christofas was the senior man in the Brussels end of the team led by Sir Con O'Neill that prepared the ministerial rounds. His special task was the adoption of the <i>acquis communautaire</i>, the mind-numbing task of reviewing the community's secondary legislation which a new entrant had to enact and apply. The mountain of documents over which he laboured was unfeelingly displayed on the table where Heath signed the Accession treaty in 1972.<br>
<br>Christofas's rare European expertise took him back in 1972 to the Cabinet Office, where he worked with the committees responsible for European affairs. When Britain joined the EC in 1973, he was appointed to the post of director-general of the secretariat of the Council of Ministers, responsible for, notably, the work of the economic and finance council and relations with the European parliament. These charges made full use of his talents but his finer hour came with the inauguration in 1975 of regular meetings of heads of state and government in the European Council. Ministers came to know and appreciate his mastery of his subjects, his skill with his pen, the methodical preparations he undertook, and the masterly records he composed. More than one delegation paid tribute to his &#145;farouche intelligence&#146; and, on tricky occasions, his ability to magic away a difficulty by the smooth adjustment of a phrase in translation. A man of some theatricality (and with more than a passing resemblance to Alfred Hitchcock), he once espied in a corridor Walter Scheel, then German foreign minister, and rushed towards him with open arms&#151;making the security officers reach for their pistols. Parliamentarians, too, appreciated his professionalism in the defence of council interests for which they might have little sympathy. In conferring on him the parliamentary gold medal, of which he was the first recipient not to be an MEP, they little knew how deep this diplomatic professionalism ran. His private advice to colleagues dealing with the European parliament was to &#145;treat them like dirt&#146;.<br>
<br>Christofas was not a man to seek popularity among his staff but he inspired their respect, slightly tempered by the pet name they gave him, M. Bretelle, from the red braces which he sported. His closest collaborator, a tough German, once said that he had never had a difference with him. He had a tight schedule for his weekly flight back to Eastbourne, chiding the cabin crew to get off the ground and enable him to catch his train at Gatwick (to which the airline conveyed him by taxi). On these trips, dressed down and clutching his bag of washing, he was a world away from the dapper British public servant of his working life.<br>
<br>Christofas retired in 1982 and was promoted KCMG. He was briefly able to spend more time on one of his passions, motoring, until left disabled by a stroke a few years later. Long-distance rail travel, meticulously planned, continued to absorb him, and it was while returning from one of his outings that he collapsed and died in Victoria Station, on 3 November 1992; he was cremated at Brighton crematorium. He would have wanted to be remembered for his role in Britain's participation in the ever closer European union. He was the test of Britain's ability to enrich the corps of European public servants who, unseen, enabled their political masters to reach their publicly-proclaimed agreements. Having known war in the European and Far East theatres he was among those devoted to burying &#145;age-old rivalries&#146; and escaping from &#145;bloody conflicts&#146;&#151;to use the language of the treaty of Rome's preamble. He confirmed that a great Englishman could also be a great European.<br>
