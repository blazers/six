<span class="headword">Powell,  Robert Stephenson Smyth  Baden-</span>, first Baron Baden-Powell  (1857&#150;1941), <span class="occ">army officer and founder of the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides</span>, was born at 6 Stanhope Street, Paddington, London, on 22 February 1857, the sixth son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22642/', "Revd Baden Powell (1796&#150;1860)")</script>, Savilian professor of geometry at Oxford, and his third wife, Henrietta Grace (1824&#150;1914), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25961/', "Admiral William Henry Smyth (1788&#150;1865)")</script>, who claimed descent (almost certainly incorrectly) from John Smyth of Virginia (1580&#150;1631), and who also incorrectly claimed she was a great-niece of Nelson. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22648/', "Sir George Smyth Baden-Powell")</script> was his brother. His father, a liberal theologian, died in 1860. Robert was brought up within a large, closely-knit family, dominated by his mother, who governed her children's lives well beyond childhood. Manipulative, and obsessively concerned with social status and family advancement, she moved to London and attempted on limited means&#151;her total income was between &pound;700 and &pound;800 p.a.&#151;to promote the careers of her sons. She wrote, &#145;I am determined not to make any new friends unless very choice people indeed&#146;  (Jeal, 24). In 1869 she changed the family name from Powell to Baden-Powell, partly to set her own children apart from their half-siblings and cousins. She also quartered the Powell arms with those of the duke of Baden, to which she was not entitled: surprisingly, the College of Arms agreed to this. Henrietta was not close to Robert (known as Stephe, pronounced Steevie), and he grew up craving parental affection and esteem. He was to show considerable theatrical talents, combined with a deep emotional reserve.<h2>
<a name="Education"></a>Education</h2>Baden-Powell was educated at home until 1864, at dame-school in Kensington Square, London, and in 1867 briefly at a small private school in Cheshire, before going in 1868 to his father's old preparatory school, Rose Hill, in Tunbridge Wells. In 1870 he was sent to Charterhouse School as a gownboy, on the nomination of the duke of Marlborough, so receiving a free education on the Charterhouse Foundation. He showed little interest in his studies, but was a successful goalkeeper in the school football eleven. He was a keen cadet, and shot for the school at Wimbledon. The school, which moved from London to Godalming, Surrey, in 1872, allowed him to explore local woods, giving him a taste for outdoor adventure, an enthusiasm encouraged by the headmaster, William Haig Brown (1823&#150;1907). At the same time he showed talent for acting and mimicry, as well as sketching and drawing ambidextrously. Baden-Powell acquired a number of nicknames and was seen as &#145;a bit of a card&#146;. He made almost no close friends among his peers, but remained a loyal Old Carthusian and was later president of the Old Carthusian Club.<h2>
<a name="Earlyarmycareer"></a>Early army career</h2>Baden-Powell's mother planned he should attend Oxford University, then enter the army as a university candidate. In 1876 he failed the entrance examinations to Balliol College and Christ Church, Oxford, a fact which he later omitted from his autobiography. However, he succeeded in the army examinations, passing second into the cavalry and fifth into the infantry. Excused Sandhurst, because war with Russia seemed imminent and more officers were wanted, he was gazetted lieutenant in the 13th hussars, then stationed in Lucknow, on 11 September 1876. He left England on 30 October. Baden-Powell did not enjoy his first two years: he failed to make friends, was bullied, and found the regiment's &eacute;litism overbearing. He went home on sick leave in December 1878. Failing to change regiment, he attended a musketry course at Hythe, Kent, before returning to India in the spring of 1880. Stationed at Kandahar in Afghanistan, in the aftermath of the Second Anglo-Afghan War, he was mainly involved in mapping and reconnaissance work, laying the foundations of his later military reputation. Upon moving to Quetta in the summer of 1881 he met another young officer of the regiment, Kenneth McLaren (<i>d</i>. 1924), whom he nicknamed &#145;the Boy&#146; for his youthful looks. Sharing enthusiasm for polo and pigsticking, on which Baden-Powell later wrote an authoritative handbook, <span class="italic">Pig Sticking and Hog Hunting</span> (1889), they lived together and were almost inseparable. The friendship was one of the most important relationships in Baden-Powell's life. He served as an adjutant from 1882 to 1886, and was promoted captain in May 1883. Keen to be noticed, and to supplement his income, he published <span class="italic">Reconnaissance and Scouting</span> (1883) and regularly sent sketches to the <span class="italic">Daily Graphic</span>. In November 1884 Baden-Powell's regiment was ordered to Natal in readiness to support Sir Charles Warren's Bechuanaland expedition. He published <span class="italic">Cavalry Instruction</span> in 1885, which was well received, and returned to England in November.<br>
<br>Baden-Powell had yet to make his mark, and his next nine years were frustrating. His poor academic training led to his failing to secure admission to staff college in November 1886&#151;he blamed an attack of fever&#151;and, lacking a military patron, he was forced in November 1887 to accept the position of aide-de-camp (later he was promoted military secretary) to his uncle, Sir Henry Smyth (1825&#150;1906), the commander-in-chief of Cape Colony. He joined an expedition against the Zulu, and came to admire their discipline, physical beauty, and prowess. He found his official duties irksome, but enjoyed colonial informality. Lacking an alternative, he followed his uncle to Malta in October 1890, with the rank of brevet major. He undertook a number of gentlemanly espionage trips in the eastern Mediterranean between 1890 and 1893, embellished accounts of which appeared in <span class="italic">My Adventures as a Spy</span> (1915). Promoted major in 1892, he was stationed in Ireland from late 1893.<br>
<br>Baden-Powell's fortunes changed in November 1895, when he was picked by the commander-in-chief, Lord Wolseley, to raise and command the native levy for Sir Francis Scott's expedition against King Prempeh of Asante, inland from the Gold Coast. Heavily dependent on Chief Andoh of Elmina, Baden-Powell's thousand-strong pioneer force participated in the successful invasion of Asante. Scott secured the submission of Prempeh who, to Baden-Powell's regret, chose not to fight. His later account, <span class="italic">The Downfall of Prempeh</span> (1896), was dedicated to Chief Andoh. It was on this campaign that he began wearing his distinctive wide-brimmed pointed hat: balding, he preferred to be photographed hatted. Still eager to earn more money, he was the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>'s correspondent on the expedition, and he sold his sketches to <span class="italic">The Graphic</span>. Promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel, he was appointed in April 1896 chief staff officer to Sir Frederick Carrington (1833&#150;1913), who had been charged with the suppression of the Ndebele (Matabele) uprising in Southern Rhodesia. He reached Bulawayo in June and was responsible for the administration of logistics. He undertook reconnaissance in the Matopos and was nicknamed by Ndebele &#145;Impeesa&#146; (&#145;hyena&#146;): in his later accounts he changed it to &#145;the wolf that never sleeps&#146;. He was in battle, and met Rhodes, whom he greatly admired. Commanding a column of the 7th hussars and others in the Somabula Forest, 100 miles north-west of Bulawayo, he ordered in September 1896 the court martial of, and confirmed the death sentence on, the captured rebel chief Unwini, whom he believed largely responsible for the continuation of the uprising in the area. Unwini was shot. Baden-Powell's action may have shortened the uprising but was of doubtful legality since martial law had not been proclaimed, and it might have destroyed his career. He was exonerated by a court of inquiry but criticized by the British radical press, especially Henry Labouchere's <span class="italic">Truth</span>. His military reputation enhanced, Baden-Powell returned to England in January 1897 and quickly wrote <span class="italic">The Matabele Campaign</span> (1897).<br>
<br>In February 1897, on his promotion to lieutenant-colonel, Baden-Powell took command of the 5th dragoon guards. On arrival in India he reduced regimental drill and ceremonial, gave attention to reconnaissance and training (ideas later incorporated into his <span class="italic">Aids to Scouting</span>, 1899), and was unusual in taking a close personal interest in the welfare of his men. He built them a soda water factory and a temperance club, warned them against venereal disease, and tried unsuccessfully to dissuade them from visiting the local brothel. He also continued his amateur dramatics and practical jokes.<h2>
<a name="ThesiegeofMafeking"></a>The siege of Mafeking</h2>In July 1899, as the situation worsened in South Africa, Baden-Powell was selected for special duties. With the title commander-in-chief, north-west frontier forces, he raised 500 irregulars, with the aim of tying down Boer troops, and maintaining the loyalty of the local natives. On arrival Baden-Powell, extremely vulnerable to Boer attack, decided to occupy the border town of Mafeking, with its 1500 white and 5500 black inhabitants. Because the town was not easily defended, Baden-Powell had to improvise defence works, at the same time maintaining civil and native morale and continuing to harry the Boers besieging the town. It is estimated that during October and November 1899 some 6000 to 8000 Boer troops were in the vicinity, deployments which significantly reduced their military strength in other areas. The siege lasted 219 days, and Baden-Powell's reports, with their cheeky and jaunty style, increasingly attracted public interest at home.<br>
<br>As the siege lengthened Baden-Powell's priorities had to be the sustaining of morale as food supplies diminished, while remaining prepared for a Boer attack. This he achieved largely through force of personality, using fully his theatrical, reconnaissance, and organizational abilities. He ordered the attack (26 December) on the Boer outpost, the Game Tree Fort. The operation was bungled, causing unnecessary casualties: the worst blunder of the siege. In early January his difficulties increased on his being told by his military superiors to hold out until May 21, six to eight weeks longer than he had been led to expect. News of Mafeking's final relief reached London on the evening of 18 May, and provoked an outburst of popular patriotism throughout the country, and in many other parts of the English-speaking world. Baden-Powell acquired a heroic status. Later historians have disagreed about the significance of the Mafeking crowds, but the celebrations clearly crossed existing class, religious, and political divides. The <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> concluded:<blockquote>And the story is all the more moving because the defence is an achievement not so much of professional soldiers as, to a great extent, of men and women before the war we should not have been able to distinguish from the average Englishmen in the colonies. (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 19 May 1900, 9b)</blockquote>Baden-Powell's role in the defence of Mafeking gave him a unique status for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Baden-Powell was promoted major-general in August 1900 and ordered by the new commander-in-chief, Lord Roberts, to form a police force to aid pacification once the war was concluded. In setting up the South African constabulary&#151;for which he designed an idiosyncratic uniform with American stetsons and special badges&#151;Baden-Powell, with his views on training and welfare, faced much obstruction from the military and civilian authorities, still engaged in fighting the war. In June 1901 he had to take home leave from exhaustion, and by his return in January 1902 the force was fully established.<h2>
<a name="Inspectorgeneralofcavalry"></a>Inspector-general of cavalry</h2>In late 1902 Baden-Powell was appointed inspector-general of cavalry (from May 1904 redesignated inspector of cavalry), his first War Office posting. He did not enjoy it, disliking a desk-bound routine, and having little talent for military politics. His popular status created jealousies, and senior cavalry officers resisted his attacks on their expenses. His principal concern was with the quality of cavalry training, and as part of his efforts at improvement he founded in 1904 the cavalry training school at Netheravon on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, and in 1906 was one of the founders of the <span class="italic">Cavalry Journal</span>  (see Warren, <span class="italic">EngHR</span>, 1986, 384, n. 1). In the contemporary debates about the future role of the cavalry Baden-Powell expressed his belief that it would have to adopt a more individualistic and reconnaissance role, using the rifle as its main weapon, rather than retain its traditional emphasis on mass formations, <i>esprit de corps</i>, and the use of the lance. His <span class="italic">Cavalry Training</span> (1904), reflecting these views, prompted fierce resistance from the conservatives, led by Lieutenant-General Sir John French (1852&#150;1925) and Major-General Douglas Haig (1861&#150;1928). In subsequent editions the offending sections were removed. Baden-Powell later acknowledged that he had not anticipated the effects of mechanization on the role of the cavalry.<h2>
<a name="ScoutingforBoys"></a>Scouting for Boys</h2>Baden-Powell's popular status also made him an attractive figure to voluntary organizations seeking his endorsement. In particular he became aware that his military manual <span class="italic">Aids to Scouting</span> (1899) was being used by church organizations, such as the Boys' Brigade and the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), and also that the popular press could be useful in promoting his own reputation and ideas. He became a vice-president of the Boys' Brigade in May 1903, and conducted a major inspection at Glasgow in April 1904. Gradually he became convinced that his training methods, with their focus on individual responsibility, fitness, and reconnaissance, could be used in a non-military environment. He also absorbed domestic concerns about physical deterioration, moral degeneracy, juvenile crime, blind-alley employments, &#145;wasters&#146; and &#145;slackers&#146;. R. B. Haldane (1856&#150;1928), secretary of state for war, persuaded him that character training should be at the centre of any scheme of boy instruction. Although pressed by Roberts and the National Service League to back the campaign for compulsory military training, Baden-Powell had already identified the scout's training as the best way to train future citizens. Meetings with the Legion of Frontiersmen and the American naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton (1860&#150;1946)&#151;founder of the American boys' organization the Woodcraft Indians&#151;gave him more ideas and encouraged him to place his training ideas in an outdoor context, something consistent with his upbringing and professional experience. A growing contact with the newspaper magnate Sir C. Arthur Pearson (1866&#150;1921) led him to write a training manual for boys in the summer of 1907, and to hold an experimental camp on Brownsea Island in Poole harbour, Dorset, in July. Twenty-two boys from public schools and the local Boys' Brigade were divided into four patrols with animal and bird names, and did swimming, fieldcraft exercises, scouting games, and survival training, led by Baden-Powell, wearing long shorts and an old trilby, assisted by &#145;Boy&#146; McLaren: six of the Brownsea boys later died on the western front. <span class="italic">Scouting for Boys</span> was published in fortnightly parts in January 1908. Within each of its chapters (or camp fire yarns, as they were called) Baden-Powell brought together all his training ideals, placing them in an attractive camping and frontier-based environment. Linked to this were recommendations on how the individual scout might improve himself in the company of other scouts, so as to become a happier individual and better citizen. Underpinning this approach was a personal pledge to keep the scout promise (that &#145;on his honour&#146; he would be loyal to God and the king, that he would help other people at all times, and keep a series of simply expressed scout laws). Separate sections were included for church and youth leaders on how to use these ideas in their own programmes. The book was an eclectic pot-pourri of advice, stories, and games in the style of the popular boys' journalism of the day, and was an immediate success. Through its many editions and translations it has remained continuously in print, and is estimated to have sold more copies worldwide than almost any other text, excluding the <span class="roman">Bible</span>.<h2>
<a name="Thegrowthofscoutingandguiding"></a>The growth of scouting and guiding</h2>Scout troops sprang up quickly around the country, some independently and others attached to existing organizations such as the Boys' Brigade and the YMCA. Early examples included those in Glasgow, Birkenhead, and Croydon. Possibly to his surprise, Baden-Powell found himself impelled to form his own organization, the Boy Scouts, during 1908. From then on his life was inextricably connected with the movement he had founded. He designed a scout uniform that was practical, attractive, and redolent of frontier adventure: soon it was recognized everywhere, and it was used virtually unchanged until the 1960s. Having been promoted lieutenant-general in June 1907 he was commander of the Northumbrian division of the new Territorial Force from 1908 to 1910. As scout troops were set up around the country he found the small office in London, paid for by Pearson, increasingly inadequate. Rivalries and misunderstandings proliferated, of which the most troublesome was with Sir Francis Vane, bt (1861&#150;1934). Centred on London, and involving clashes of personality as well as principled arguments about militarism and the hierarchical nature of the early headquarters structure, this dispute threatened the existence of the fledgeling organization in the late autumn of 1909. A small breakaway association, the British Boy Scouts, was established with Vane as its president. Impatient with bureaucratic structures, Baden-Powell found himself forced into forming a national committee to support the growing number of local associations. The team was brought together after the first national rally of scouts at the Crystal Palace, London, in September 1909. Sea Scouts were introduced in 1910 with Baden-Powell's brother Warington (1847&#150;1921) writing their training manual. In March 1910 Baden-Powell retired from the army to devote himself fully to the scouts. He secured royal patronage, George V reviewed scouts in Windsor Great Park in July 1911, and a royal charter was granted in January 1912. It is estimated that there were some 100,000 scouts by 1910.<br>
<br>Such was the public interest generated that girls also wanted to become scouts. At first Baden-Powell seems to have anticipated a co-educational movement, but facing criticism that a scout's training would encourage tomboyish attitudes, he agreed to produce a separate training manual for girls, in association with his sister Agnes. Even so, many elements of <span class="italic">Scouting for Boys</span> were included in <span class="italic">How Girls can Help Build up the Empire: a Handbook for Girl Guides</span> (1912).<br>
<br>The Girl Guides Association was formally incorporated in September 1915, and both movements spread widely, at first largely in the English-speaking world, but also in Europe, and later in Africa and Asia. Within the United Kingdom Girl Guides Baden-Powell's wife, Olave (1889&#150;1977) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30779/', "Powell, Olave St Clair Baden-, Lady Baden-Powell")</script>], whom he had married in 1912, became increasingly dominant; with his backing she replaced and excluded Agnes Baden-Powell and became chief commissioner in 1916.<br>
<br>Baden-Powell always insisted that individual character training was at the centre of his scouting method, rejecting accusations of militarism and resisting overtures from Roberts and others. Nevertheless among the early scouting volunteers his ideas were capable of more than one interpretation, and Baden-Powell steered a slightly uneven course on the militarism question between 1908 and 1910. Many of his adult enthusiasts came from among existing church workers with boys. As a result his character-training scheme had to acquire a more explicit religious and moral underpinning than was contained in <span class="italic">Scouting for Boys</span>, yet without losing its non-denominational character. Before and during the First World War Baden-Powell resisted attempts to incorporate the scouts into a national cadet scheme. Rather he argued that a war requiring mobilization of the nation's resources created opportunities for trained civilian war-service by boys and girls. Of the many examples the scouts' national coast-watching scheme was the best known. Under pressure to form a section for younger boys, Baden-Powell in 1916 started the Wolf Cubs, based partly on his friend and admirer Rudyard Kipling's <span class="italic">Jungle Books</span>: Kipling became an honorary scout commissioner. Baden-Powell later provided for young men over eighteen, which he did less convincingly around the theme of chivalric dedication and service in his <span class="italic">Rovering to Success</span> (1922). A lasting advantage of the scout movement has been its benefactors' generosity, locally and nationally. For example, the 6th Richmond, founded in 1916, still uses the building donated by Lady Archer. In 1918 the movement received a major benefaction, Gilwell Park, Essex, bought for it by a Scottish rubber magnate, W. F. de Bois MacLaren. There Baden-Powell established the movement's national and international training centre for scouters. He preferred it to the London Imperial Headquarters and was often there. By 1918 scouts and guides were established features of national life in Britain and the empire, and, with variations, throughout the world.<h2>
<a name="Theinterwaryears"></a>The inter-war years</h2>From 1918 to 1939 the scout and guide movement grew worldwide, though banned in totalitarian states. In Britain the movement's rivals, the older uniformed organizations and the newer left-wing organizations including the Woodcraft Folk and the Young Communist League&#151;the latter in 1927 sent Baden-Powell a coffin&#151;did not approach them in popularity. With their global appeal and unifying philosophy scouts and guides were well placed to express the prevalent internationalism, in ways which included great international camps (jamborees), of which the first was held at Olympia, London, in August 1920, and at which Baden-Powell was proclaimed chief scout of the world. Scouting and guiding were seen as a junior League of Nations, and Baden-Powell and his wife travelled much, encouraging and supporting both movements, and being accorded a reception similar to that of a head of state. Nor were these activities simply symbolic. As the founder, Baden-Powell tried to resolve differences and disputes in very different cultural, political, and religious circumstances, particularly in India and South Africa, where he was only partially successful. By 1939 the total world membership of the scout and guide movement was about 5 million.<h2>
<a name="Marriageandfamilylife"></a>Marriage and family life</h2>Before his return to England in 1902 Baden-Powell's life had been almost exclusively military and familial, the latter dominated by his mother. His closest personal relations had been with McLaren, and he had had no intimate female liaisons. Increasingly put under pressure to marry by his mother, he was attracted by the idea of family life and having his own children, and he made several proposals of marriage. He was apparently not attracted to women of his own age, preferring older widows or much younger women. It has been alleged that he was a repressed homosexual. In January 1912, on a world tour, he met on SS <i>Arcadian</i> Olave St Clair Soames. Thirty-two years his junior, she also had had a complicated family and emotional upbringing. They were immediately attracted to each other. For her, he represented a heroic figure, cast in a mould of idealism; for him, she reflected energetic, enthusiastic, unconventional, physical femininity. They were married at St Peter's Church, Parkstone, Dorset, on 31 October 1912. Nervous prior to his engagement, Baden-Powell found early married life difficult, its physical side giving him intense headaches and disturbing dreams, which only ceased on their sleeping apart. But after the birth of their three children (a boy, followed by two girls), it was a happy, supportive, companionate partnership, in which each was dedicated, almost exclusively, to scouting and guiding. Baden-Powell wanted to have the ideal scouting and guiding family, but his status and hopes were apparently an oppressive burden for his son, (Arthur Robert) Peter Baden-Powell (1913&#150;1962), despite the great efforts made by his now elderly father to adjust his excessive ambitions for his son. All his children married in his lifetime, and his younger daughter, Betty, later took over her parents' role as head of the movement's first family.<h2>
<a name="Oldage"></a>Old age</h2>Baden-Powell was increasingly honoured at home and internationally. Having been knighted in 1909, he became a baronet in December 1922, GCVO in 1923, and, recommended by Ramsay MacDonald, first Baron Baden-Powell of Gilwell in September 1929, an honour announced at the international jamboree held at Arrowe Park, Birkenhead, to celebrate the &#145;coming of age&#146; of scouting. Later he was appointed to the Order of Merit (1937), and awarded the Carnegie Wateler peace prize (1937). Previously, he had been master of the Mercers' Company (1913). He received many honorary degrees&#151;including an Oxford DCL (1923) and a Cambridge LLD (1931)&#151;and foreign decorations. Throughout the inter-war period Baden-Powell continued to write extensively on scouting, as well as commenting on contemporary affairs in a light, journalistic style. At first he admired the apparent dynamism of Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany, but later he revised his opinion. Nevertheless he continued to be na&iuml;vely optimistic about the value of continuing the contacts between youth organizations across Europe. Like many of his generation he was more fearful of Bolshevism than fascism, and he supported the Munich agreement. His opinions on national and international politics attracted leftist criticism then and later. Not a systematic thinker, Baden-Powell failed to see that equality of opportunity could not be achieved by voluntary action alone. In fact, he had little time for politics of any kind. In matters of religion he was formally an Anglican, but was extremely intolerant of denominational differences, founding his simple faith on the worship of nature and doing good to others.<br>
<br>In October 1938 Baden-Powell and his wife retired to their bungalow Paxtu, at Nyeri in Kenya. There he lived quietly, reading and corresponding; typically, his last memorandum was in protest against a proposed compulsory state youth training service in late 1940. He gradually weakened, and he died peacefully at Paxtu on 8 January 1941. He was buried in St Peter's churchyard, Nyeri, the next day, as was his widow in 1977. Among many memorial plaques, both lives are commemorated in Westminster Abbey. He was succeeded as baron by his son, Peter, who defied his own mother's wish that he should not take his father's title &#145;since there was only one Lord Baden-Powell&#146;  (Jeal, 575).<h2>
<a name="Personality"></a>Personality</h2>Baden-Powell was slim and spare in physique, and of medium height. Although he enjoyed the uniforms and insignia of success his personal tastes were simple, tending to the austere. He slept on an open verandah for most of his married life. His principal recreations were fishing and sketching. He could be stubborn and eccentric, and not everyone enjoyed his taste for practical jokes and amateur dramatics, but almost all his later scouting associates were inspired by his vision, versatility, and energy which, in many cases, transformed their lives; he remained for them, simply, &#145;the Chief&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Baden-Powell's remarkable career has been more argued over since his death than during his lifetime. In 1900 he was a popular patriotic hero, seen as exemplifying all that was best in the British character. In 1941 he died, lauded as a figure of global significance, having founded the two largest youth organizations in the world. Since 1941 both reputations have been attacked. Some historians (Gardner, Willan, and Pakenham) have alleged that at Mafeking his theatrical style was merely self-promotion, covering military incompetence and indecision, as well as hiding racial assumptions, which led him to starve Africans, and expose them to greater danger than white inhabitants. The most detailed and balanced examination of the evidence (Jeal) refuted these charges, while recognizing that Baden-Powell failed in his later accounts to acknowledge sufficiently the African, especially BaRolong, military contribution. Baden-Powell's successful defence of Mafeking was not strategically significant after its first two months: it proved, however, to be a heroic episode of considerable domestic importance in one of the first wars in which civilian reaction to military events was a critical factor in the overall conduct of war. Commentators have also focused on Baden-Powell's intentions in writing <span class="italic">Scouting for Boys</span>. For some, the book reflected all the anxieties of the Edwardian governing classes&#151;physical deterioration, the threat of class-based politics, fears of military and imperial weakness&#151;and the need to establish new forms of social control (Springhall, Rosenthal). For others, it was an innovative book, providing an imaginative, recreative training programme in the outdoors, based on non-denominational religious and moral principles (Warren, Wilkinson, Jeal). In these interpretations, the book's broader social purpose lay in the better training of future citizens and happier, more fulfilled individuals. This was to be achieved through personal self-improvement and team participation, linked to a readily understood moral and spiritual code, based on an inclusive brotherhood. Both interpretations can find supporting evidence in Baden-Powell's writings between 1900 and 1910.<br>
<br>Taking the longer view, the Boy Scout and Girl Guide movements remained very much the creation of their founder, even though both he and they showed a considerable capacity to adapt and change. Each was dedicated to the individual development of character through a training scheme which was based on the small group (the patrol), and each focused on ideas of voluntary social or civic service as a means of individual fulfilment and social improvement. Both sought the development of the whole person, physically, mentally, and spiritually, and were committed to ideals of a common humanity, believing that this informal training in personal development could be best achieved through camping and outdoor activities. As such, both organizations were seen as a progressive force by almost all commentators in their founder's lifetime. Only in his final years, in the United Kingdom at least, did it become clear that scouting and guiding had to be part of the range of voluntary and statutory provision for the development of future citizens.<br>
