<span class="headword">Thompson,  John</span>  (1775?&#150;1864), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, entered the navy in December 1787 and, having been on the books of various ships on the home station, joined the <i>Lion</i> in June 1792 with Captain Erasmus Gower and made the voyage to China. On his return he was promoted, on 18 December 1794, a lieutenant of the <i>Bombay Castle</i> in the Mediterranean, which was one of the fleet with Hotham in the action off the Hy&egrave;res Islands on 13 July 1795; the ship was with Jervis during the blockade of Toulon in 1796 but was wrecked in the Tagus in December 1796. For his exertions then in saving life he was commended by Vice-Admiral Charles Thompson, president of the court martial on the loss of the ship. He was afterwards in the <i>Acasta</i> in the West Indies and, having distinguished himself in several boat expeditions, was appointed to his flagship, the <i>Sans Pareil</i>, by Lord Hugh Seymour. After Seymour's death he was promoted by his successor, Rear-Admiral Robert Montagu, on 28 April 1802 to command the sloop <i>Tisiphone</i>. He returned to England in January 1803 and commanded a division of sea fencibles for a year. He married in 1805 a sister of Dr Pickering of the Royal Military College, Marlow. They had a large family; one son, Thomas Pickering Thompson, died an admiral, aged eighty-one, in 1892.<br>
<br>In January 1806 Thompson was appointed to the sloop <i>Fly</i>, in which he was in the West Indies, at the Cape of Good Hope, and in the River Plate, where he commanded the flotilla intended to co-operate in the attack on Buenos Aires and assisted in landing and re-embarking the army. He was then appointed acting captain of the prize-frigate <i>Fuerte</i> and went home in charge of convoy; but the Admiralty refused to confirm the promotion and Thompson was sent back to the <i>Fly</i>, which he commanded off the French coast during 1808. In 1809 he commanded a division of the flotilla in the Scheldt, and was advanced to post rank on 21 October 1810. He had no further service, but on 1 October 1846 accepted the rank of rear-admiral on the retired list, on which he became vice-admiral on 27 May 1854 and admiral on 9 June 1860. He died at his home at Longparish, Hampshire, on 30 January 1864, aged eighty-eight.<br>
