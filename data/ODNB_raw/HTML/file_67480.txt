<span class="headword">Best,  Sigismund  Payne</span>  (1885&#150;1978), <span class="occ">intelligence officer</span>, was born on 14 April 1885 in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, the son of Dr George Payne Best (<i>d</i>. 1908), then senior physician at Birmingham General Hospital, and his wife, Catherine Sophia Allinson (<i>d</i>. 1908). His maternal grandmother was said to have been the daughter of an Indian maharaja. He was privately educated in Britain and Germany, his father having been appointed <i>Dozent</i> to the medical faculties of various German universities and practising privately in Vienna, Leipzig, and Dresden. At fifteen, Sigismund was apprenticed to a firm of chartered accountants, but he did not qualify. His father, mother, and brother all died within three months of each other in 1908. As the sole heir he was left with a private income of about &pound;800 a year, on the strength of which he married and moved back to Germany, enrolling himself at the University of Munich and at an academy of music in Munich. He returned to England in 1911, becoming a member of the Purley rural district council and otherwise leading the life of a country gentleman. On the outbreak of war with Germany in August 1914 he was recruited into the newly created intelligence corps of the army and sent to France with the rank of second lieutenant. There in 1915 he made the acquaintance of the legendary head of the Secret Intelligence Service, the mysterious &#145;C&#146;, Mansfield Cumming. Cumming's son was killed in the same motor accident in which Cumming lost his leg, and Payne Best won his confidence as the man who arranged his son's burial. Early in 1915 he was sent to the Netherlands to set up an intelligence network to report directly to C. His net recruited Flemish refugees from Belgium and ran agents into German-occupied Belgium, concentrating on the German order of battle in Flanders. He survived various &#145;turf wars&#146; with rival agencies and networks, ending the war with the rank of captain, earning an OBE and the Belgian Croix de Guerre, and being made a chevalier of the French L&eacute;gion d'honneur; he also received two unsuccessful recommendations for the Military Cross and two mentions in dispatches.<br>
<br>On demobilization Payne Best went into business in the Netherlands, where he remarried (his first wife had died in obscure circumstances). His new wife, Bridget Allardyce, was the daughter of a Dutch general. With the advent of Hitler to power in Germany and the increasing prospects of a new European war, he was recruited in 1938 into the newly formed &#145;Z&#146; organization, a new branch of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) founded by one of C's deputies, Colonel Claude Dansey, to take over from the increasingly compromised SIS organization in Europe.<br>
<br>In summer 1939 C's successor, Admiral Sinclair, was diagnosed as suffering from terminal cancer (he died on 4 November 1939). There were two candidates for the succession, Colonel Dansey and Colonel Stewart Menzies. At the same time, Dansey was approached through a Free German organization in London, whose activities had enjoyed some SIS funding, on behalf of a group allegedly of senior German commanders, anxious to thwart Hitler's plans for war and to overthrow him. In fact a number of clandestine contacts between individual members and sections of the conservative-military-bureaucratic opposition to Hitler in Germany were already current, but so far as is known these had not been with the SIS, nor had any of them, so far, mentioned a military coup against Hitler. Menzies took up the contacts with energy and enthusiasm, in which he was supported, against the initial scepticism of the Foreign Office and of Payne Best, by the newly appointed head of the SIS station in The Hague, a Major Stevens. Stevens's previous experience of intelligence work had been confined to India. The contacts were taken very seriously in London. Communications with the allegedly dissident German officers were handled by the foreign secretary, Lord Halifax, himself. British strategy at this time was predicated on the hope that Germany's economic weakness would precipitate internal discontent, which, it was hoped, would be followed by some kind of internal upheaval in which Hitler would be neutralized or removed from office.<br>
<br>Unfortunately for Stevens and Payne Best, the original contacts proved to have originated with the German SS. The two men, accompanied by a Dutch intelligence officer, were lured to the Dutch&#150;German border at the small village of Venlo and kidnapped across it by an SS commando led by the young and ambitious Walter Schellenberg, who ended the war a full general in the SS and head of the SS external intelligence service (which in 1944 had swallowed the German army's military intelligence arm, the Abwehr). In the turmoil the Dutch officer received fatal wounds. Both Payne Best and Stevens were held for a show trial, together with a German workman who had carried out a one-man attempt to kill Hitler with a bomb in the Munich Bierkeller in which Hitler's attempted coup of 1923 had begun, at the height of the exchanges between the as yet unmasked Schellenberg and the British. Most of the German intelligence was incorporated into the German declaration of 9 May 1940, justifying the German invasion of the Netherlands.<br>
<br>Payne Best and Stevens were incarcerated initially in the concentration camp at Sachsenhausen. But in the last days of the war they were added to the group of prominent European political figures and relatives of the allied war leaders whom the Germans were keeping as hostages in their forced migration ahead of the allied forces, ending up in the depths of the south Tyrol. Here Payne Best emerged as the undoubted leader of the hostages, persuading their SS guards to disobey orders to execute their charges, overriding a somewhat melodramatic plan by the local Italian partisans to storm their prison and release whoever was fortunate enough to survive such an adventure, and arranging for the prisoners to be liberated by a detachment of American soldiers.<br>
<br>Payne Best's reward was to be silenced by the SIS authorities and to be suspected of having given everything away, whereas the facts argue that his main fault was to leave Stevens to have his version of events accepted before Payne Best could return to England. The Treasury treated his financial problems with the same lack of engagement that it was to show to most other clandestine claimants upon British generosity. Payne Best was allowed to publish a very much bowdlerized account of the incident, being refused permission to cite the wealth of evidence produced by the official Dutch inquiry in 1947. In retirement he reverted to his youthful passion for classical music and devoted himself to encouraging various young musicians of promise. He died on 21 September 1978 at his home, 18 Lickhill Road, Calne, Wiltshire; his wife survived him.<br>
