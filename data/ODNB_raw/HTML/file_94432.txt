<span class="headword">Jabavu,  Davidson Don Tengo</span>  (1885&#150;1959), <span class="occ">educationist in South Africa</span>, was born in King William's Town, Cape Colony, on 20 October 1885, the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53763/', "John Tengo Jabavu (1859&#150;1921)")</script>, newspaper editor and politician, and his first wife, Elda Sakuba (1864&#150;1900). Both parents belonged to the Mfengu (Fingo) ethnic group, refugees from early nineteenth-century wars to the north who had settled in the eastern Cape. The Mfengu were early converts to Christianity, who had acquired education from mission schools. Jabavu's families were staunch Methodists: his maternal grandfather, James B. Sakuba, was an ordained Methodist minister. Along with other Africans from similar backgrounds the Jabavus aspired to full citizenship under Cape Colony's colour-blind franchise, while at the same time maintaining their African identity. Named after an advocate of African rights, the Revd John Davidson Don, and his paternal grandfather, Jabavu's name (usually shortened to D. D. T.) reflected this dual identity.<br>
<br>Jabavu received an education fitting for the senior son of the prominent editor of the Xhosa-language paper <span class="italic">Imvo Zabantsundu</span>. After attending a local mission school in 1892 and continuing from 1898 to 1900 at a missionary teacher training college in Morija, Basutoland, he spent a year at the well-known Lovedale missionary institution. Jabavu's father next sought to enrol him in the local government secondary school for white boys. Rebuffed, Jabavu was sent to Wales, where from 1903 to 1906 he attended the African Training Institute at Colwyn Bay. He then went to University College, London, graduating BA in English in 1912; he received a secondary teacher's diploma from the University of Birmingham in 1914. Three months visiting Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, USA, in 1913 further expanded his intellectual and social horizons. At the behest of the South African minister for native affairs he prepared a report, ultimately published in his book <span class="italic">The Black Problem</span> (1920), that examined how Booker T. Washington's educational philosophy and practices might be applied to higher education for Africans in South Africa.<br>
<br>Jabavu returned home in 1914, and in 1916 became one of the two initial academic staff members of the South African Native College at Fort Hare, in the founding of which his father had played a key role. Over the coming decades it was the principal provider of university education for African students from throughout southern Africa. As Nelson Mandela, one of Jabavu's students, later noted: &#145;Fort Hare and Professor D. D. T. Jabavu are virtually synonymous&#146;  (Mandela, 38). In August 1916 Jabavu married Florence Tandiswa Makiwane (1895&#150;1951), a Lovedale teacher and daughter of the prominent Presbyterian minister Elijah Makiwane (1850&#150;1928). She later headed the college's women's hostel. The couple had four children, Nozipo (1917&#150;19), Helen Nontando (Noni) (<i>b</i>. 1919), Alexandra Kerr (<i>b</i>. 1926), and Tengo Max (1928&#150;1955). Jabavu remained associated with Fort Hare until his retirement in 1944, having been promoted to professor in 1942. He taught a wide range of subjects, including Xhosa, Latin, history, and social anthropology. In 1954 Rhodes University recognized his pioneering role in African higher education by awarding him an honorary doctorate.<br>
<br>Jabavu's academic position provided him with the visibility and stature for active engagement in, and leadership of, a wide range of civil society activities. He sought to promote teacher welfare through founding the Cape Native Teachers' Association in 1920, and the South African Native Teachers' Association the following year. The government invited him to participate in the annual native conference that it launched in 1920 to gauge African opinion. His social and political outlook led naturally to his active involvement in the interracial joint councils, where he worked with white liberals interested in improving African social conditions. He became vice-president (1932&#150;59) of the successor organization, the South African Institute of Race Relations.<br>
<br>Jabavu also became more overtly involved in political activities from the mid-1920s in response to Prime Minister Hertzog's assault on the African franchise. This led him to publish <span class="italic">The Segregation Fallacy and Other Papers</span> (1928). The government's growing pressure on African rights led, in 1935, to a conference of more than 400 delegates representing opposition organizations from across the political spectrum. The All-African Convention emerged from the conference, with Jabavu as its president, a position he held until 1948. Utilizing the tactics of petition and pushing for moderate reforms to defend African civil rights, the All-African Convention was unable to deter the government's determination to entrench yet further white domination. Within a few years, the momentum of African politics bypassed the All-African Convention and its gradualist approach.<br>
<br>Jabavu was particularly interested in improving the lot of African farmers. Indeed, his commitment to the welfare of rural Africans differentiated him from most of his contemporaries among the African educated &eacute;lite. Tuskegee's extension work among black farmers stimulated him to adapt what he had learned during his 1913 visit to South African conditions. In 1918 he began organizing native farmers' associations in the eastern Cape, and in 1925 he helped found the South African Native Farmers' Congress, serving as its secretary for two decades. The Zenzele movement, which his wife launched in 1927 to improve African women's domestic skills, complemented his agricultural extension work.<br>
<br>Upon retirement Jabavu moved to rural Middledrift. He continued his prolific writing, but instead of dealing with broader political or educational issues he now focused more on Xhosa history and culture, publishing books such as <span class="italic">Imbumba yamanyama</span> (&#145;Unity is strength&#146;; 1952) and <span class="italic">Izithuko</span> (&#145;Praise poems&#146;; 1954). The 1950s brought major personal transitions: the death of Florence in 1951; the murder of his son Max in Johannesburg in March 1955; and, two weeks later, his own marriage to Betty Marambana, a widow and mother of four children. He retreated from the public stage that he had so long occupied and spent his final years quietly. He died in hospital in East London, Cape Province, South Africa, on 3 August 1959, having been hospitalized for three months with an infected ulcer on his leg. He was buried in Middledrift on 10 August.<br>
