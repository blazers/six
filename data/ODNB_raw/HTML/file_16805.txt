<span class="headword">Livingstone,  George</span>, fourth earl of Linlithgow  (<em>c.</em>1652&#150;1695), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16804/', "George Livingston, third earl of Linlithgow (1616&#150;1690)")</script>, soldier and politician, and his first wife, Lady Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1659), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18368/', "Patrick Maule, first earl of Panmure")</script>, and widow of John, second earl of Kinghorne. First commissioned, as captain in the Scots foot guards (the new regiment of foot guards), in September 1668, he actively assisted his father in harrying the covenanters in the aftermath of the Pentland uprising of 1666. During the covenanter rising of 1679 Lord Livingstone, as he was then titled, saw further active service at the battle of Bothwell Bridge on 22 July. During the critical point in this engagement he advanced with 300 Scots foot guards to support Theophilus Oglethorpe's troop of the Royal Dragoons, which was in danger of being cut off. His intervention swayed the balance in favour of the duke of Monmouth's army, and the covenanters were heavily defeated. On 1 May 1684 he was promoted through the patronage of the duke of York to command the troop of the Scottish life guards (the Scottish troop of horse guards) in succession to the marquess of Montrose. About this time he was created provost of Linlithgow equipped with special powers by the Scottish privy council to deal with covenanters in and around that town, where the burghal authorities had, in Livingstone's opinion, been deficient in vigour.<br>
<br>In September 1688 the entire Scottish army, amounting to 2946 soldiers, marched south to reinforce James II, ready to face the anticipated invasion by William of Orange. Livingstone and his men were thus present at the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle on Salisbury Plain during November, and retired with the royal army along the Thames valley towards London. Following the earl of Feversham's decision to disband the royal army, Livingstone, now acting commander of the Scottish forces, asked permission of William of Orange to march his troops home in formed units. William was happy to oblige as he thereby preserved the Scottish army intact and assisted the maintenance of law and order in England. Livingstone attended the Scottish convention on 14 March 1689 as representative of Linlithgow, but he was not allowed to take his seat because he was the son of a peer. When Viscount Dundee defied the convention on behalf of James II on 18 March 1689 and left for Stirling with a troop of dragoons, he spent that night at Linlithgow. Livingstone was tempted to join him but, on receipt of a visit from a herald of the Scottish estates, who ordered him to lay down his arms and appear before the convention within twenty-four hours on pain of arrest for treason, he immediately detached himself from Dundee and complied. Later in the year, accompanied by a body of horsemen, he travelled to the residence of his brother-in-law Lord Duffus in Sutherland. This was construed as an intention to join the Jacobite army in the highlands and the council summoned him to Edinburgh. Although he endured a few days' imprisonment in Edinburgh Castle, his explanations were accepted and he was among those who took advantage of the offer of indemnity before the deadline of 10 September.<br>
<br>Livingstone succeeded as fourth earl of Linlithgow on 1 February 1690 and continued to toy with Jacobite conspiracies, but a serious illness in 1691 presented the opportunity for reflection upon the direction of his career. He determined to abandon flirtations with Jacobitism in favour of seeking an accommodation with William III and to transfer his allegiance from episcopacy to presbyterianism. Initially the earl of Portland was sceptical of the sincerity of Linlithgow's sudden double conversion, but on receipt of a signed statement giving the reasons for his change of heart, an interview with the king was arranged. William was impressed with his personal qualities and apparent political acumen and considered making him lord chancellor of Scotland. Instead, in 1692 he was appointed to both the Scottish privy council and Treasury commission, a move sometimes seen as seeking to balance party positions within the government of Scotland, Linlithgow still being considered part of an &#145;episcopalian&#146; party. On 22 July 1695 he was granted the escheat of Urquhart, part of the forfeited estate of the earl of Dunfermline. Linlithgow had married, before 1689, Lady Henrietta Sutherland, the eldest daughter of Alexander, Lord Duffus, but, as they had no children, the succession passed to his nephew James Livingstone, fourth earl of Callandar, on his death on 7 August 1695. Linlithgow was survived by his wife. He was buried in Linlithgow church.<br>
