<span class="headword">Pearce <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Clark]</span>,  Nathaniel</span>  (1779&#150;1820), <span class="occ">traveller</span>, was born on 14 February 1779 at East Acton, Middlesex. Incorrigibly unruly, he was sent to boarding-school at Thirsk, Yorkshire; twice apprenticed to London tradesmen, he twice ran away to sea, the second time joining a naval vessel. In May 1794 he was captured by the French, but eventually succeeded in escaping; he then served on various naval and merchant ships, meeting many adventures round the world. Having survived a shipwreck off Cape Town, he served some years in the <i>Lancaster</i>, under Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, going under the name of Clark, his mother's maiden name. While invalided in a hospital in Bombay, he accidentally fatally injured a guard, and, escaping, joined the <i>Antelope</i>, an East Indiaman under the orders of Viscount Valentia to map the African coast of the Red Sea. To avoid a return to India he deserted at Mocha in 1804. He was obliged to profess Islam, but soon regretted it, and, on Valentia's return to Mocha, begged for rescue.<br>
<br>In June 1805, Valentia sent his secretary, Henry Salt, on a mission into Abyssinia, to establish friendly relations with Ras Welled Selass&eacute; of Tigr&eacute;. Pearce, who accompanied Salt, was asked by the ras to enter his service. Several times, court intrigues and Pearce's own outspoken nature set the ras against him, but eventually his proven loyalty and courage made him a secure favourite. In 1808 he married Turinga, the half-Abyssinian daughter of a Greek, Sidee Paulus. In 1810 he escorted Salt's second mission into Abyssinia, acting as his interpreter. Another Englishman, William Coffin, remained to join the ras's service, and he and Pearce lived and fought side by side until the death of the ras in 1816 brought rival chiefs to battle over the succession.<br>
<br>In October 1818 Pearce and Turinga fled Abyssinia for Egypt, where Salt was now British consul-general. As servant to John Fuller and the Revd William Jowett, Pearce journeyed up the Nile, reaching Wadi Halfa. He became steward of Salt's consulate in Cairo, and was employed by Jowett to translate parts of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> into Tigr&eacute;, for the Church Missionary Society. Turinga died in May 1820 and Pearce was to return to England, the record of his naval desertion erased through the mediation of influential well-wishers. But, while awaiting a passage at Alexandria, he succumbed to a bilious fever and died on 12 August 1820. At his particular request, he was carried to his grave at the Greek convent in Alexandria by six English sailors.<br>
<br>Fuller wrote of Pearce:<blockquote>He was a man of superior intellectual powers, of great observation and able to communicate his thoughts in an original and vigorous style &hellip; He was altogether an extraordinary character. Great warmth of temper and an unbounded spirit of enterprise were the sources of all his errors. His good qualities were courage, activity, intelligence and zeal in the service of his employers. (Fuller, 259)</blockquote>Salt wrote: &#145;His memory &hellip; will be forever held in respect by all who knew his sterling worth, and who admire an honest heart joined to a true English spirit&#146;  (Halls, 2.159). Pearce's journals were published in 1831 as <span class="italic">The Life of Nathaniel Pearce</span> (2 vols.).<br>
