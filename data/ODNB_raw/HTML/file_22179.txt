<span class="headword">Phillips,  William</span>  (1773&#150;1828), <span class="occ">printer and geologist</span>, was born on 9 May 1773 at the Poultry, London, the son of James Phillips (1745&#150;1799) and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whiting (1747&#150;1808). His father was a Quaker, originally from Cornwall, who had settled in London in 1768, acquiring the major Quaker printing and publishing house of Mary Hinde at George Yard, Lombard Street in 1775. His stepgrandmother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22145/', "Catherine Phillips (1727&#150;1794)")</script>, the noted Quaker minister.<br>
<br>Phillips was much influenced by his father, served an apprenticeship with him, and took over the business when his father became ill about 1791. On 11 October 1796 Phillips married Sarah Kincey (1776&#150;1807); they later had one daughter, who died aged seventeen. Much involved in Quaker philanthropy, Phillips distributed thousands of pounds for Richard Reynolds (1735&#150;1816), acting in this as agent for his father. The year after his marriage, with William Allen (1770&#150;1843), Phillips established an influential soup society, with the aim of providing cheap and nutritious food to the destitute of Spitalfields. He also published an important <span class="italic">Appeal &hellip; on the Accumulation of Wealth</span> in 1824.<br>
<br>Phillips had had an early interest in crystallography&#151;reflected by the quartz crystal he holds in the portrait of him which appears in an 1891 memoir by his widow. He was a founder member of the London Askesian Society in 1796. With his chemist brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22168/', "Richard Phillips (1778&#150;1851)")</script>, he was active with the British Mineralogical Society from 1800, submitting geological samples and a mineralogical map of Cornwall. He was one of the thirteen founders of the Geological Society of London in 1807, and, in the words of the society's historian, &#145;the most distinguished, as a geologist, of the original founders&#146;  (Woodward, 13). Phillips was chosen as the society's printer in 1810 and printed its first five volumes (1811&#150;21), four both at his own risk and at a loss.<br>
<br>Phillips's first wife died on 26 October 1807 and &#145;his spirits were often depressed&#146;. His second marriage, to Christiana Walduck (<i>c</i>.1786&#150;1834) on 19 March 1811, stimulated him to re-engage in the scientific work which had been &#145;stopped&#146;  (Phillips, 12). In 1814 Phillips gave free lectures on geology and mineralogy to young people in his home village, Tottenham. These were printed and published as an <span class="italic">Outline of Mineralogy and Geology .. for .. Young Persons</span> in 1815 (4th edn, 1826). In 1816 he published <span class="italic">An Elementary Introduction to &hellip; Mineralogy .. for the Student</span>. His crystallographic work in this, using W. H. Wollaston's reflecting goniometer of 1809, drew high praise from its inventor. His <span class="italic">Eight Familiar Lectures on Astronomy</span>, another interest, followed in 1817.<br>
<br>All Phillips's scientific work had to be done in the evenings after work at the printing house. His connections with Cornwall explain his attachment to that county in his early works. His greatest influence was in stratigraphy, as a result of the chapter, &#145;The geology of England and Wales&#146;, added to the second edition of his <span class="italic">Outline</span> (1816). This took William Smith's recent geological map as its basis by reproducing a reduced specially permitted version. The book was enlarged as <span class="italic">Selection of Facts to Form an Outline of the Geology of England and Wales</span> (1818). It included the then latest version of William Buckland's &#145;Order of superposition of strata in the British Isles&#146;  (Torrens, 68). The <span class="italic">Selection</span> was in turn much enlarged, through important contributions from the Revd William Conybeare (1787&#150;1857), to become the jointly authored classic <span class="italic">Outlines of the Geology of England and Wales, Part 1</span> (June 1822). William Fitton noted in 1828 how this book had &#145;had an effect, to which nothing since the institution of this [Geological Society] and the diffusion of Geological maps of England can be compared &hellip; no equal portion of the earth's surface has ever been more ably illustrated&#146;  (Fitton, 57).<br>
<br>In his last decade Phillips published important stratigraphic papers on the rocks of Dover and Snowdon, and one on Charnwood Forest, which early separated cleavage from bedding. He was honoured with the naming of a mineral after him in 1825 and election as FRS in 1827. Phillips was attacked by an inflammation of the lungs and then dropsy and died at his home on Tottenham Green on 2 April 1828. He was buried at the Quaker burial-ground in Whitechapel. His widow was to note with justice how &#145;few were so variously gifted as he&#146;  (Phillips, 13) and how he thought it &#145;better to wear out than rust out&#146;  (ibid., 21).<br>
