<span class="headword">Bowden, Sir  Frank</span>, first baronet  (1848&#150;1921), <span class="occ">cycle manufacturer</span>, was born on 30 January 1848 in Bristol, the son of William Bowden (<i>d</i>. 1866), a Bristol manufacturer, and his wife, Louise (<i>d</i>. 1879), daughter of Henry White of Bath. Bowden's grandfather had also been engaged in manufacturing in the Bristol area. The death of Bowden's father cut short his education and he took up an apprenticeship in a solicitor's office in London. Four years later he secured a post in the office of the principal law officer, Hong Kong, where he rose to a senior position and amassed a personal fortune dealing throughout the Far East in real estate, stocks, and shares.<br>
<br>By 1878 Bowden's health began to break down and he decided to satisfy his interest in travel. He moved to San Francisco and in 1879 met and married Amelia Frances (<i>d</i>. 1937), daughter of Colonel Alexander Houston, one of the pioneers of California State. In 1885 he visited Harrogate in England and sought medical advice regarding his ill health. He was advised to take up the pastime of cycling and purchased a second-hand tricycle, on which he rode in the winter and early spring of 1886&#150;7. Impressed by the benefits to his health, and recognizing the potential that cycling had to offer, Bowden visited the makers of his tricycle, Angois, Woodhead, and Ellis of Nottingham, and persuaded the company to accept him as its financial backer.<br>
<br>In January 1889 the Raleigh Cycle Company was incorporated and in 1891, after a disappointing public flotation, Bowden acquired a controlling interest. The 1890s witnessed considerable growth in the cycle industry and the Raleigh Cycle Company Ltd grew significantly through its advertising campaigns, its racing successes, and by building a thriving export business. By 1896 the company had been floated with a capital of &pound;200,000, although Bowden retained a substantial share of this. When the cycle industry witnessed a slump in 1898 Bowden was in a position personally to manage the financial crisis while the firm underwent restructuring. In 1908 another financial crisis arose after substantial debts were incurred by the company, and Bowden was prepared to secure the debts on his personal fortune only if he had complete ownership. Raleigh was to remain a private company until a &pound;2 million public flotation in 1934.<br>
<br>Bowden made a substantial contribution to Raleigh's success. Although seen as an autocrat by some, he was prepared to entrust aspects of the management to those with talents he recognized. He could be single-minded at times, particularly in his severance with Woodhead and Angois who ceased to serve on the board after 1894. There were failed ventures, such as Bowden's promotion of wooden rims for cycles, which demonstrate that he was not infallible, but Bowden did recognize the significance of American manufacturing methods and marketing and his company was among the UK pioneers of sheet steel pressings and liquid brazing in connection with cycle manufacture. Being an active cyclist Bowden was one of the first English manufacturers to recognize the potential benefits which pneumatic tyres and variable gears had to offer. In January 1903 he founded the Three-Speed Gear Syndicate Ltd, which became the Sturmey Archer Gear Company in June 1908.<br>
<br>Bowden became a public figure; at local level he was a JP for Nottingham and at national level he wrote widely on his travels, being elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society about 1906. His main publication on cycling was <span class="italic">Cycling for Health and Points for Cyclists</span> (1913). In 1915 he received a baronetcy for turning the Raleigh works to munitions manufacture. He died of heart failure at his home, Bestwood Lodge, Bestwood Park, Arnold, Nottinghamshire, on 25 April 1921. His only son, Harold, succeeded to the baronetcy and assumed control of the company.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_46646"></a><span class="headword">Sir Harold Bowden</span>, second baronet  (1880&#150;1960)<span class="occ"></span>, born in San Francisco on 9 July 1880, was educated at Clifton College, Bristol, then went to Lausanne to study languages before entering Clare College, Cambridge. His studies were prematurely ended in 1899 when his father brought him into the business and in 1905 he was elected to the board as a director. Despite suffering ill health as a boy, as a young man he was a cyclist and keen athlete. In later years he was a supporter of the athletics movement and acted as a fund-raiser for, as well as serving as chairman of, the British Olympic Association in 1931&#150;5. He maintained a high public profile, writing and broadcasting on the activities of the company and promoting cycling in the popular media. Throughout his life he held senior offices in cycle trade associations and employers' associations and at local level served as high sheriff of Nottingham in 1933.<br>
<br>Harold, too, chose to delegate to others, as his father had done. While not a major innovator he did recognize the potential of American methods of scientific management and his visit to Henry Ford's works in America in 1921 clearly had an influence on his policy while managing director. His concern was to retain the reputation for the quality of the product while reducing costs of production. While this led to occasional disputes with the shop-floor workers, he sought harmonious industrial relations and introduced profit-sharing schemes and invested in workers' welfare. In 1938 he retired as managing director of the Raleigh Cycle Company: he retained his chairmanship of the Raleigh Cycle Holdings Company Ltd (which had been founded in 1934), and later served as a director of Lloyds Bank. Among his honours was the appointment as GBE in 1929, and the award of the grand cross of the order of the Phoenix (Greece) awarded in 1932. In 1948 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.<br>
<br>Harold Bowden married four times. His first marriage, to Vera, daughter of Joseph Whitaker JP, on 7 July 1908, was dissolved in 1919. He married Muriel Smythe, divorcee and daughter of William Ker-Douglas, on 18 January 1920. After her death in 1952 he married on 4 November 1952 June Schenker, divorcee and daughter of Christopher T. H. Mackay, who died in the following year. On 11 February 1957 he married Val&eacute;rie Came-Porter, widow of Albert Renfrew Porter and daughter of Richard Raymont-Came. He had one son, Frank, and one daughter, Ruth, from his first marriage. His home for many years was the Old Farm House, Marsh Court, Stockbridge; he died in the Royal Hampshire County Hospital, Winchester, on 24 August 1960.<br>
