<span class="headword">Owens,  John</span>  (1790&#150;1846), <span class="occ">merchant and philanthropist</span>, was born in Manchester, the eldest son of Owen Owens (1764&#150;1844) and his wife, Sarah (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Humphreys). Two other sons died in infancy. His parents were Welsh, his father being a native of Holywell, Flintshire; they married in 1788 and moved to Manchester shortly after. Owens was educated at a private school in Manchester owned by John Huthersal, author of textbooks on English grammar, arithmetic, geography, and Latin, but by 1808 he was helping in his father's business of hat-lining cutter and hat maker. Until 1812 the firm confined itself to the home trade, but from then on began to seek markets overseas.<br>
<br>In 1815, at the age of twenty-five, Owens became a partner in the firm, which by then also made a variety of cotton goods on the putting-out system, manufactured umbrellas, and exported all these and other goods to North and South America. The firm's home trade was neglected after about 1820 and soon ceased to have any importance. In and after 1825 the Owenses invested &pound;10,000 in a cotton mill owned by Samuel Faulkner &amp; Co., in which George Faulkner was a partner. The investment proved satisfactory, giving a return of nearly 10 per cent per annum over eighteen years, after which Owens withdrew his capital. About 1830 Owen Owens retired from business, leaving his son in sole charge at their dingy warehouse in Carpenters Lane off Tib Street. There was an immediate widening of the firm's range of export markets to include the Middle East, India, and China. At the same time the manufacture of cheap cotton goods for export was abandoned. The profits of foreign trade were by no means derisory if a merchant had the patience to wait for his returns, but by 1840 Owens was turning, in a familiar transition, from trade to finance. Speculating in corn, cotton, and railway shares, and moneylending on the security of such shares, occupied most of his business mind in the remaining years of his life. He died at his home, 10 Nelson Street, Rusholme, Manchester, on 29 July 1846, at the age of fifty-six, and was buried in the churchyard of St John's, Byrom Street, Manchester. In the forty years during which he was associated with the business he had seen its capital grow from perhaps &pound;5000 to more than thirty times as much.<br>
<br>Accounts of Owens's appearance agree in describing him as unprepossessing, and in little else: he has been called above and below middle height, broadly built, and sharp featured. Like his father, he disliked borrowing, spent little of his income, worked long hours, and had few holidays, none of them further from home than London. In his lifetime he subscribed moderately to local medical and educational charities, supported the Anti-Corn Law League, bought the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, read some at least of Scott's novels, and worshipped at his local Anglican church, St Saviour's. At his death his personal effects were valued at &pound;400, which did not allow for much plate or for a large library. Although variously described as morose or a recluse, he belonged to a glee club, and entertained modestly at his house in Rusholme, then a pleasant Manchester suburb. He died a bachelor, with no relatives closer than cousins.<br>
<br>Nothing in his life suggested that Owens would in death found a university college, but it does not follow that the idea was put into his head by George Faulkner or Samuel Fletcher; there is no evidence one way or the other. Talk of a university college in Manchester had been in the air since the mid-1830s. The idea, whatever its origin, was already in Owens's mind in 1844, because he was instructing his solicitor about a will embodying large charitable bequests within five weeks of his father's death. He finally signed the will on 31 May 1845. After substantial bequests to relatives, friends, and servants, and small bequests to local charities, he left the residue (nearly &pound;100,000) to found a college for the instruction of young men not less than fourteen years old, &#145;in such branches of learning and science as are now or may be taught in the English universities&#146;. Apart from the restriction to men, which was to be expected at the time, no stipulations were to be imposed on staff or students, whether as to religion, condition in life, or place of birth.<br>
<br>Owens's trustees lost no time in liquidating the remaining stock of textiles and other often ancient reminders of businesses long since abandoned. They sold all but the soundest of his railway shares, and invested the proceeds in safe securities. In view of the subsequent fall in share prices the trustees acted wisely, for Owens would probably have died a poorer man had he lived a few years longer. Owens College opened in 1851 in Quay Street, Deansgate, Manchester, and remained there until 1873 when it moved to new and much larger premises in the Oxford Road. The University of Manchester traces a direct line of descent from this foundation, and until recently was affectionately and fittingly known to its students as &#145;Owens&#146;.<br>
