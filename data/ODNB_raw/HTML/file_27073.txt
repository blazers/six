<span class="headword">Taylor,  Reynell George</span>  (1822&#150;1886), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the youngest son of Thomas William Taylor of Ogwell, Devon, who served with the 10th hussars at Waterloo. Taylor was born at Brighton on 25 January 1822. From Sandhurst, where his father was lieutenant-general, he was gazetted cornet in the Indian cavalry on 26 February 1840. He first saw service with the 11th light cavalry (Bengal) in the Gwalior War of 1843, and at the close of the war was appointed to the bodyguard. In the First Anglo-Sikh War he was severely wounded in the cavalry charge at Mudki on 18 December 1845, and on his recovery was appointed assistant to the agent at Ajmer. Thence, in 1847, he was sent to Lahore, and became one of that famous group of men who worked under Henry Lawrence, and subsequently John Lawrence, in the Punjab. The same year, and when only twenty-five years of age, he was left, at a critical period, <i>hakim-i-wukt</i> (ruler) of Peshawar, in charge of 10,000 Sikh troops and the whole district. His firmness and his justice in criminal cases earned him the love of the people, ensured discipline, and gained the praise of his superiors. When it was decided to occupy the province of Bannu, Taylor organized the column from Peshawar, and led 4000 men in safety through the Kohat Pass (November and December 1847). The outbreak of the Second Anglo-Sikh War found Taylor in charge of Bannu. On hearing of the murders of Patrick Alexander Vans Agnew and W. A. Anderson at Multan on 20 April 1848, he at once dispatched all his most trustworthy troops to the assistance of Sir Herbert Benjamin Edwardes, and remained alone at his post. In July he was ordered to proceed to Multan, which was besieged, and thence he set out as a volunteer to rescue the English captives at Peshawar. His efforts being frustrated by treachery, he endeavoured to help Herbert, who was besieged at Attock. With this end in view, he gathered an irregular force of 1021 foot, 650 horse, and 3 doubtful guns, and laid siege to the fort of Lakki, the key to the Derajat, on 11 December 1848. Though far removed from all possibility of support, and unaided by a single fellow-countryman, he captured the fort on 11 January 1849. For his services he was promoted captain on 15 December 1851, and major the next day. On 11 December 1854 he married Ann, daughter of Arthur Holdsworth of Widdicombe, Devon. They had a large family and she survived him.<br>
<br>In 1855, after his prolonged visit to England, Taylor was appointed commandant of the corps of guides. During the Indian mutiny he was in charge of the Kangra district, and in 1859 he was appointed commissioner of the Derajat. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 21 December 1859 and in 1860 he took part, as chief political officer, in the Waziri expedition. Before retiring from the Derajat, in order to become commissioner of Peshawar in the spring of 1862, he induced the Church Missionary Society to establish a station in the district at considerable cost to himself. In 1863 he served throughout the Ambela war, was gazetted colonel on 3 April 1863, and CE the following month; but it was not until June 1866 that he was made CSI. After a short visit to England in 1865 he returned for the last time to India, to become commissioner of the Ambala division, and in 1870 of the Amritsar division. He retired in 1877 as major-general, becoming lieutenant-general that year, and general on 15 December 1880. He died at his home, Malston House, Newton Abbot, Devon, on 28 February 1886, and was buried at East Ogwell church, Devon, on 5 March. His bravery in the field had won him the title of &#145;the Bayard of the Punjab&#146;; the Indians called him always their <i>ferishta</i> (good angel), and his charity had made him a poor man.<br>
