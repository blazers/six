<span class="headword">Ballow <span class="st"> [Bellewe]</span>,  Henry</span>  (1704?&#150;1782), <span class="occ">legal writer</span>, was probably born on 3 May 1704 in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, the son of Henry Ballow and his wife, Dorothy. He was admitted a pensioner at Magdalene College, Cambridge, on 15 October 1720, and admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 27 January 1721. Ballow was called to the bar on 6 November 1728. By 9 July 1731 he held the post of deputy chamberlain of the exchequer, subsequently rising to be senior deputy chamberlain. He is said to have obtained his position in the exchequer, which relieved him of the necessity to practise, through the influence of the Townshends &#145;to whom he had been a kind of law tutor&#146;  (Hawkins, 244), but his father may himself have been deputy chamberlain of the exchequer between 1688 and 1713.<br>
<br>Ballow's legal learning was deep and extensive, and Samuel Johnson attributed his own knowledge of the law chiefly to Ballow's teaching, regarding him as a &#145;very able man&#146;  (Boswell, 2.294). Ballow's legal learning appears to have manifested itself in permanent form in <span class="italic">A Treatise upon Equity</span>, published anonymously in 1737, which appeared in 1793&#150;4 with references and substantial notes by John Fonblanque, and reached its fifth edition in 1820. The treatise provided, in six short books, a systematic explanation of equity in terms of contract theory. The author regarded the specific enforcement of contracts as the core of equity, and his work represents for later generations the state of equity in the period between the times of the great lord chancellors Lord Nottingham and Lord Hardwicke. The treatise was founded upon the cases, the results of which it stated accurately, though the author cited very few authorities and gave no references to the cases, which rendered the book less valuable to the student than it might have been. Ballow's authorship, though generally accepted, is not certain. Fonblanque pointed out that if Ballow were the author he had produced the work while still of less than ten years' standing at the bar. Further doubt may arise from the apparent influence of Roman law training upon the book's method. However, Francis Hargrave's copy contains a note by Hargrave that the book was written by Mr Bellewe, and one of the manuscripts which passed to Lord Camden as Ballow's literary executor contained a large portion of the work, revised and corrected apparently for publication.<br>
<br>Beyond his legal learning, though possessed of &#145;vulgar manners&#146;, and described as &#145;a little deformed man&#146;  (Hawkins, 244), Ballow was said to be an accomplished Greek scholar and to have been famous for his knowledge of old philosophy. At one time he frequented Tom's Coffee House in Devereux Court, London, where his splenetic temper led him into a quarrel with the poet and physician Mark Akenside, whom Ballow envied for his eloquence and hated for his republican principles. Akenside's consequent challenge went unanswered, the difference being made up by friends, and the antagonists adhering to their respective resolutions that one would not fight in the morning and the other would not fight in the afternoon. Ballow died suddenly in Parliament Street, London, on 26 July 1782. He did not marry.<br>
