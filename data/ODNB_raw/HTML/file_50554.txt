<span class="headword">Howarth,  Charles</span>  (1814&#150;1868), <span class="occ">co-operative movement activist</span>, was born on 9 February 1814 in Rochdale, Lancashire, the son of George Howarth and his wife, Susan (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Bamford). Little is known of Howarth's early life and education, but while in his teens he was drawn to socialism and influenced by the ideas of Robert Owen. An Owenite project of self-employment among flannel weavers in Rochdale was established in 1829, followed in 1830 by the First Rochdale Co-operative Store. It is unclear how long the latter survived and whether it was through this venture or a successor that Howarth became associated with co-operation. He was, however, linked with a store trading at 15 Toad Lane between 1833 and 1835.<br>
<br>On 5 April 1835 Howarth married Ann Chadwick, and in the years to 1862 they had four sons and five daughters. Howarth secured relatively well-paid employment as a warper at Hoyle's cotton mill on Oldham Road, Rochdale, and was recorded as living nearby in 1841 and 1851. He remained an active Owenite as a member of the no. 24 branch of the Rational Society from its foundation in 1838 until 1845. During the early 1840s Howarth was also locally prominent in agitation for the <span class="roman">Ten Hours Act</span>, being sent as a delegate to lobby parliament. He is, however, most associated with the revival of co-operative trading in Rochdale.<br>
<br>At the first formal meeting of the Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60696/', "Rochdale Pioneers")</script>] on 11 August 1844 Howarth was appointed as one of three trustees. He was also chiefly responsible for drafting the society's rules. These reflected not only immediate concerns about wage rates and malpractice by shopkeepers but also radical causes then current in Rochdale. The project attracted disillusioned Chartists, and the planned temperance hotel suggests the involvement of teetotallers; but it was pre-eminently Owenite in stamp, and its aims included industrial and agricultural self-employment and the development of a co-operative colony. Howarth indeed drew upon existing Owenite sources, notably the model rules presented at the 1832 Co-operative Congress and those governing the Rational Association Sick and Burial Society of Manchester. He also included provisions for the conduct of co-operative storekeeping which have been seen as laying foundations for successful consumers' co-operation. Claims made for the originality of this constitutional development cannot, however, be substantiated. Dividend on purchase, for example, was known from at least the 1820s and was more widely discussed in the 1830s and 1840s than some historians have credited. It is unlikely that Howarth independently reinvented the &#145;divi&#146;.<br>
<br>Howarth's rules were, however, the basis for the development of the Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society, which started trading on 21 December 1844. Howarth acted as president of the society during 1845 and as secretary for several periods. In 1850 Howarth drafted rules for a co-operative corn mill society being established in Rochdale, and became its first secretary, and in 1854 he was a promoter of the Rochdale Co-operative Manufacturing Society. Howarth also contributed to the wider extension of co-operation. In 1856 he was a delegate at a conference in Rochdale which considered developing a wholesaling operation co-owned and funded by several consumers' co-operatives. Howarth was also involved in campaigning for the amendment of the <span class="roman">Industrial and Provident Societies Act</span> to allow such co-operative federation. The passage of new legislation in 1862 enabled the foundation of the North of England Co-operative Wholesale Society of which Howarth was a leading promoter, serving on its management committee until October 1866.<br>
<br>During the late 1850s Howarth moved some 3 miles to Heywood. By 1859 he was auditor for the Heywood Co-operative Society. He was also manufacturing washing soda and bleach which were sometimes purchased by the Co-operative Wholesale Society&#151;a potential conflict of interest which led to his departure from its committee. Howarth was, however, a founder of the Co-operative Insurance Company in 1867, remaining a director until his death.<br>
<br>Howarth's death on 25 June 1868 at his home, 28 Wilton Street, Heywood, was attributed to asthma. He was buried five days later at Heywood cemetery. Howarth was probably not well off in his later years, having left his work as a warper during the mid-1860s. On his death the Co-operative Wholesale Society granted &pound;20 to Howarth's wife who, with five of their children, survived him.<br>
