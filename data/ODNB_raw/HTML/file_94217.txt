<span class="headword">Slay,  Desmond</span>  (1927&#150;2004), <span class="occ">Old Icelandic scholar</span>, was born on 30 December 1927 at the Victoria Nursing Home, Thame, Oxfordshire, the son of Wilfred Charles Slay (1907&#150;1987), outfitter's assistant, and his wife, Doris Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walker (1904&#150;1979). At the time of his birth registration his parents lived at 3 St John Street, Oxford. He was educated at Lord William's Grammar School, Thame, and St Catherine's Society, Oxford, from which he graduated in 1948 with first-class honours in English. He was immediately offered a lectureship at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, by his external examiner, Gwyn Jones. He remained at Aberystwyth throughout his career, involving himself energetically in university affairs (including a stint as dean of the faculty of arts) and being appointed to the Rendell chair of English language and literature in 1978. He married Leontia Mary Cecilia McCartan, daughter of Bernard McCartan, schools inspector, at Aberystwyth on 10 April 1958. Two years his junior, and a graduate of Queen's University, Belfast, at the time of their marriage she was a university lecturer in zoology at Aberystwyth; she was later active in the playgroup and scouting movements. They had one daughter and four sons.<br>
<br>Slay's research into Old Icelandic literature took the form of editions of major texts, in close association with the Arnamagn&aelig;an Institute in Copenhagen. In 1960 he published a monograph on the manuscripts of the legendary saga <span class="italic">Hr&oacute;lfs saga kraka</span>, which anticipated by some thirty years the principles of the new philology in according weight to all elements in the text's transmission, rather than dismissing those copies considered to be secondary. For this he was awarded a doctorate of the University of Wales. In the same year he published an edition of the saga that acted as a model for many subsequent editions of Icelandic prose texts. In 1997, shortly after his retirement from Aberystwyth, his edition of the <i>riddarasaga</i> (&#145;chivalric saga&#146;) <span class="italic">M&iacute;rmanns saga</span> appeared in the same <span class="roman">Editiones Arnamagnaeanae</span> series.<br>
<br>While still involved in research on <span class="italic">Hr&oacute;lfs saga</span> Slay achieved a coup that earned him the lasting respect of the Icelandic literary establishment by tracking down the important mid-fourteenth-century manuscript book <span class="italic">Skar&eth;sb&oacute;k (Codex Scardensis)</span>. It is the most complete medieval Icelandic collection of the <span class="roman">Lives of the Apostles</span>, and preserves the fullest versions of some of the lives. It was known to have gone missing from Iceland in the early nineteenth century, and to have been in the library of Sir Thomas Phillips of Thirlestaine House, Cheltenham, in the early 1890s, but had since disappeared. Alerted by J&oacute;n Helgason of the Arnamagn&aelig;an Institute to a record of its sale in 1945, Slay traced the codex with diligence and acumen, persuading the new owners to allow the copying of the manuscript for the production of a facsimile edition (published in 1960 as <span class="italic">Early Icelandic Manuscripts in Facsimile</span>, vol. 2, edited by Slay). Armed with the information he provided, Iceland was able to obtain the codex when it came up for sale again in 1965, with finance from a group of Icelandic banks, who presented the retrieved treasure to the nation. This and other services to Icelandic literary history were recognized by the award to Slay of the order of the Falcon in 1992.<br>
<br>Slay produced other volumes of manuscripts in facsimile, collaborating with J&oacute;n Helgason on a facsimile of a manuscript of <span class="italic">Alexanders saga</span> (1966) and producing a facsimile of a book of romance sagas preserved in the Royal Library, Stockholm (1972). Along with Peter Foote and Hermann P&aacute;lsson, he edited the proceedings of the First International Saga Conference, held in Edinburgh in 1971. He was a significant figure in the Viking Society for Northern Research, serving as its president in 1970&#150;72 and as an editor of <span class="italic">Saga-Book</span> from 1978 to 2004.<br>
<br>In private life Slay was a keen amateur sportsman, playing basketball well into old age, and a dedicated supporter of the scouting movement for over thirty years, earning the silver acorn, the association's second-highest award, in 2004. He died at Bronglais General Hospital, Aberystwyth, of cancer of the prostate on 20 May 2004, and was survived by his wife, Leontia, and their five children.<br>
