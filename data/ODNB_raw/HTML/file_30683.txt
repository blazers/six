<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bell,  Charles Frederic Moberly</span>  (1847&#150;1911), <span class="occ">journalist and newspaper manager</span>, was born on 2 April 1847 in Alexandria, youngest of six children of Thomas Bell (<i>d</i>. 1859), merchant, and his first wife, Hester Louisa Dodd, <i>n&eacute;e</i> David, widow of a naval chaplain. Following his wife's premature death, Thomas Bell sent his children to England into the care of a relation by marriage; he remarried in 1853. After attending a local day school in south London, Bell was enrolled at a school in Wallasey, Cheshire, kept by the Revd William Clayton Greene, who remembered his pupil &#145;Charlie Bell&#146; with affection and pride. The offer of a clerkship in his father's old firm, Peel &amp; Co., brought Bell back to Alexandria in 1865. He soon approached <span class="italic">The Times</span> to propose speedier arrangements for transmitting news. With the lists of materials forwarded (part of the documentation for cargoes shipped to Britain) Bell enclosed reports on events he thought of public interest, showing an instinct for journalism that led to his appointment as Egyptian correspondent in 1867. Bell's work for Peel &amp; Co. was eventually rewarded by a partnership and most departments were placed under his general management. His standing in the local business community was reflected in an appointment to one of the Egyptian mixed courts.<br>
<br>In 1874 Bell met Ethel Chataway, a cousin of his brother-in-law, Edmund Carver, and eldest daughter of the Revd James Chataway. They were married, at Rotherwick, Southampton, on 5 August 1875. It was a happy marriage, from which Bell derived much comfort and support. Two sons and four daughters resulted; one daughter predeceased her father. On the eve of the wedding, Bell was informed of his dismissal from Peel &amp; Co. In November 1875 the Bells were back in Egypt. An agency for a Belgian trader was soon supplemented by other employments. From 1876 Bell resumed his connection with <span class="italic">The Times</span> as an occasional correspondent, being reappointed Egyptian correspondent in 1882. Bell's descriptions of events following from Arabi Pasha's revolt, including the bombardment of Alexandria, were masterpieces of reporting, earning him a reputation as an ideal correspondent. In 1880 Bell, with others, founded the <span class="italic">Egyptian Gazette</span>, though he severed his connection in 1882 when legislation threatened to suppress independent journalism in Egypt. Bell's exceptional knowledge of Egyptian affairs and personalities was displayed in three books published between 1884 and 1888, and subsequently in letters in <span class="italic">The Times</span> signed by &#145;A twenty years resident in Egypt&#146;. In September 1884 Bell sustained a severe ankle injury, which left him permanently lame. A bone had to be removed, and Bell had this mounted in a stick, declaring it should yet help him walk. While convalescing he visited London and met members of the Walter family. Arthur Walter, nominally joint manager of <span class="italic">The Times</span> alongside John Cameron MacDonald, was much impressed by Bell's energy and capabilities. In February 1890, after MacDonald's death, Walter asked Bell to &#145;come over here for a few months&#146;. He arrived in March, and his appointment was soon made permanent. Since Arthur Walter played little part in the paper's management, Bell was <i>de facto</i> in charge.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Times</span> had lost money and reputation through its publication of the Pigott forgeries of C. S. Parnell's letters in 1887. Bell immediately set out to repair the damage. His prime interest was in the paper's standing as an organ of influence in public life. He strengthened the foreign news service by establishing a foreign department in Printing House Square. Bell also succeeded, by subtle means, in appointing Flora Shaw as <span class="italic">The Times</span> colonial expert within the hitherto entirely masculine editorial preserve. His political interests&#151;he described himself as a radical with imperialistic leanings&#151;led Bell to maintain direct contact with certain overseas correspondents, while at home he cultivated a personal network of influential contacts, entertaining them at his own expense and gaining a reputation for absolute discretion. Bell was continually seeking ways of increasing circulation, but realized that <span class="italic">The Times</span> needed a subsidy from other sources. He launched several profitable publishing sideshows. With Messrs Hooper and Jackson, American publishers, Bell negotiated favourable terms for further ventures, culminating in 1905 with the Times Book Club. The club's practice of selling nearly new books at discount prices led to a &#145;book war&#146; with the publishers, which Bell waged with customary vigour. By 1908 the proprietors of <span class="italic">The Times</span> were pressing for a financial reconstruction. Bell learned from a news item received for publication that <span class="italic">The Times</span> was to be reorganized under C. Arthur Pearson's direction. Convinced that this arrangement would be detrimental to the paper, Bell acted independently to find an alternative. Through an intermediary a meeting was set up with Lord Northcliffe, and plans were made to establish The Times Publishing Co. Ltd with leading members of <span class="italic">The Times</span> staff as directors and Bell as managing director. Bell sought guarantees for the paper's character and editorial independence, but was obliged to agree to carry out Northcliffe's absolute instructions. At first things went well under the new ownership; Bell was credited with having saved <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Northcliffe respected &#145;old Bell&#146;, but increasingly found him an obstacle in the way of change. Bell saw himself as the sole protector of the <i>status quo</i>, and continued to be a restraining influence in spite of failing health.<br>
<br>Bell was a large man, with a strong face and dark complexion, which suggested to some opponents a Jewish ancestry (a family tradition among the Montefiores identified Sir Moses as his father). Able to work long hours at high pressure and full speed, he was often impatient and confrontational, though always ready to admit his mistakes. At home he was a genial family man; his sense of humour emerged in conversation&#151;talking was his sport&#151;and in correspondence. Bell's constant motivation was the well-being of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and his disregard for self-interest earned him great respect. His working methods were old-fashioned, and he never learned to delegate. He particularly enjoyed letter writing, and it was as he ended a paragraph in a typically witty letter on newspaper copyright that he succumbed to a heart attack in his office at Printing House Square on 5 April 1911; he was buried in Brompton cemetery on 8 April.<br>
