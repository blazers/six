<span class="headword">Snook,  William</span>  (1861&#150;1916), <span class="occ">athlete</span>, was born at Belle Vue, St Julian, Shrewsbury, on 3 February 1861, the son of George Snook, a road surveyor, and his wife, Mary, formerly Corfield. He was educated at Admaston College, Shropshire, and began competing in sprint handicap races at the age of sixteen, but soon found he was better suited to longer distances. It is said that he once ran a mile on a stretch of road in under five minutes wearing &#145;ordinary shoes&#146;. He took to running in one-mile handicaps and within two years was off scratch in most races. His form attracted Moseley Harriers, a Birmingham club with a reputation for signing talented distance runners, and he joined them at the age of eighteen.<br>
<br>One of Snook's team-mates at Moseley was Walter George, the most outstanding runner of the day, and together the two men helped the club to win the prestigious English cross-country team championship four successive times from 1881 to 1884. In track races, however, they were rivals, and although George won most of their encounters, Snook recorded a number of significant wins. In the 1883 Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) championship he beat George in the 1 and the 4 mile races, and two days later won the 10 miles, a race George did not contest. Snook was again the winner in the one-mile and half-mile races at Widnes three weeks later.<br>
<br>George regained the ascendancy in 1884 and beat Snook in all major races. He then turned professional and left the field open for his rival to establish himself as top amateur. Snook, who moved to Birchfield Harriers, took full advantage, winning the English cross-country race in March 1885, and four titles at the AAA championships in July that year. His fame, however, was short-lived. When he finished second in the cross-country championships at Croydon on 6 March 1886, the AAA officials decided that he had &#145;thrown&#146; the race for financial gain and suspended him for life from all amateur athletics. Bookmakers played a prominent part in athletics at that time and Snook had been heavily backed to win. The suspension was seen as a move to clean up the sport by making an example of one of its biggest names, and public opinion sided with the AAA.<br>
<br>After his suspension Snook ran as a professional for three years and was the licensee of at least two public houses in Birmingham before moving to France, where he coached runners and cyclists. His wife, Elizabeth Jane Coleman, whom he had married in August 1884, and from whom he was separated, died in 1900, their only child having died in infancy. Snook eventually returned to England in 1916, destitute and in poor health, and was admitted to the Birmingham workhouse infirmary at Erdington. He died there on 9 December 1916 and was buried in a common grave in Witton cemetery, the funeral fees being paid by Birchfield Harriers.<br>
