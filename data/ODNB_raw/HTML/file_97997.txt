<span class="headword">Shanks,  John</span>  (1825&#150;1895), <span class="occ">sanitary engineer</span>, was born in Stonefield, Paisley, Renfrewshire, on 22 December 1825, the eldest son of William Shanks, a handloom weaver and later a church officer, and his wife, Helen Gowans. He served an apprenticeship as a plumber with Wallace and Connell, Glasgow, and on completing his apprenticeship continued in their employment as a skilled tradesman or journeyman. But he was ambitious and keen to be his own master and in 1851, aged twenty-five, he started his own business at 32 High Street, Paisley, as a plumber and gas fitter. Two years later he opened a branch in Lowndes Street, Barrhead, before moving to larger premises in Main Street, opposite the Free Church, later the same year. In 1853 he married Isabella Mills (1827/8&#150;1869), with whom he had at least two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Shanks continued to operate the two premises until 1855, when he closed those in Paisley and thereafter concentrated his operations in the expanding town of Barrhead. The same year he was joined by his younger brother Andrew Ferrier Shanks, who had also served an apprenticeship as a plumber with Wallace and Connell. In 1860 Shanks established a brass foundry and finishing shop in the upper floor of the premises so he could manufacture water closets, many of which at that time incorporated working parts of iron and brass. He still had to buy the necessary cast-iron components and these were supplied by George Smith &amp; Co., of Glasgow&#151;well known for their cast-iron urinals&#151;while the earthenware closet basins came from J. M. P. Bell of Glasgow.<br>
<br>Shanks's first patent, taken out in 1863, specified a water closet (WC) with a plunger valve to release the waste and a ball cock to refill the basin. The plunger valve consisted of an india-rubber ball that was contained in a cylinder at the rear and connected to the basin by a short inclined pipe. It was known as the &#145;patent flexible valve closet&#146;, although within the works it was simply called the number 4. When the prince of Wales was taken ill with typhoid in 1871 an inspection of the drainage and sanitary condition of Buckingham Palace found that every water closet in the palace was defective except one solitary specimen of Shanks's patent number 4 found in the servants' quarters.<br>
<br>In 1866, encouraged by the success of this closet, Shanks built an entirely new brass foundry at Barrhead, named the Tubal Foundry after Tubal Cain, the first worker in brass and iron in the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. Following the death of his first wife he married second, on 2 January 1871, a widow, Jessie Turnbull Smith (<i>b</i>. 1833/4), housekeeper, daughter of Walter Turnbull, block printer. They had a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1871, at precisely the time when a mass market for fitted baths was first emerging, Shanks took out his first patent for a combined supply, waste, and overflow fitting for a bath. Before 1870 fixed baths with connections to hot and cold water and a waste outlet had been something of a luxury but from the 1870s most new middle-class houses were built with bathrooms fitted with a bath, lavatory, washbasin, and water closet. The same year Shanks took out his first patent for another sanitary appliance with which the firm was to become closely associated: this was the overhead water closet cistern or &#145;water waste preventer&#146;, which was developed by many sanitary engineers from the 1850s in an effort to stop the flow of mains water into the tank while the closet was being flushed.<br>
<br>Although Shanks had his own brass foundry, he remained heavily dependent on George Smith &amp; Co. to provide his iron castings and also to distribute his goods, and he entered a ten-year agreement to pay them 17&frac12; per cent commission on the total output of the Tubal Foundry while paying a fixed high price for the cast iron they supplied. Struggling under these terms and to lessen his dependence on Smith &amp; Co. Shanks started his own iron foundry around 1873. In 1875 he was declared bankrupt and his brother Andrew took over the firm, but by 1878 Shanks was once more able to resume active business. A new partnership was arranged of Shanks &amp; Co. with the two brothers having equal shares. By 1878 the firm had appointed an agent in London and gradually business in the capital grew and showrooms were established at 46 Cannon Street.<br>
<br>In 1877, after a break of four years probably attributable to the financial difficulties of the mid-1870s, Shanks resumed patenting sanitary ware with a substantial patent that specified improvements to water closets and cisterns, and for a cast-iron bath made with a shelf incorporating the waste and overflow. This was marketed as the Imperial bath and it enjoyed considerable success. Before the 1870s most domestic baths were made of sheet iron or copper and required the support of a wooden enclosure. From the early 1880s the use of wooden cabinet work in bathrooms was widely condemned as unhygienic as it harboured dirt and germs. Cast-iron baths won the approval of health reformers as they were free standing and therefore easier to clean around; they were also cheap and affordable. They had appeared as early as the 1850s&#151;so Shanks cannot be credited with their introduction&#151;but when they rose to popularity in the 1880s he was closely involved in their development and production, manufacturing well-designed, free-standing, enamelled cast-iron baths with a comfortable rolled edge.<br>
<br>The same patent of 1877 also covered improvements to lavatory washbasins. Shanks introduced a washbasin that replaced the projecting nozzles of ordinary taps with side inlets or slits near the rim. He soon introduced a similar arrangement which was used on his Citizen washbasin and Imperial baths. Only the spindle and knobs of the tap were visible and the water entered the basin through small perforations in the earthenware, securing, the firm claimed in 1886, the &#145;maximum of cleanliness&#146;. In 1881 he patented a bath tap with a flexible tube and perforated rose for providing a shower or spray bath and then the following year he patented a mixer tap for baths and washbasins: this had a mixing chamber that received the water from the hot and cold inlet valves, which was then discharged through a single outlet. He also catered for the luxury end of the market with such products as the Independent combined shower, spray, and full-length bath, which he exhibited at the Edinburgh International Exhibition in 1886. By then he had also introduced another luxury article, a pedestal bidet with hot and cold water and an ascending spray.<br>
<br>Shanks also extended his range of water closets, again taking out patent protection. In 1880 he took out his first patent for a wash-out closet&#151;an all ceramic water closet basin and trap containing water in the basin separate from the trap&#151;and in 1881 his first for a syphonic water closet cistern. By the early 1880s support was growing for the free-standing pedestal water closet, free of any wooden enclosure, and Shanks responded with an &#145;encased washing-out closet&#146; in which the earthenware basin and trap were enclosed in an iron shell filled with concrete. In January 1884 Shanks claimed to have sold &#145;many hundreds&#146; to hospitals and private customers but this device did not remain in production for long. In 1885 he patented a valve closet with two discharge valves for use on ships. Shanks were subsequently to supply many of the great liners built in the first half of the twentieth century, including the <i>Titanic</i>. Shanks also took out three patents for urinals between 1884 and 1892. In 1888 he patented his first syphonic water closet cistern, which employed an inverted cast-iron bell to raise the water over the syphon pipe. Shanks were to manufacture huge quantities of this type of cistern&#151;many for export&#151;including the well-known model the Levern.<br>
<br>In 1892 Shanks took out a patent for a water closet cistern close coupled to the closet basin. This was arguably his most important and original contribution to the development of the water closet. Some thirty years earlier Shanks had gone some way towards developing a low level reserve of flush water with his number 4 plunger closet, but the 1892 patent described a closet that appeared in full coloured glory in an illustrated catalogue published about a year later as the &#145;patent combination closet&#146;. The cistern was made of cast iron and coupled to a wash-down closet, which was the first of a long line of close coupled water closets used worldwide in the twentieth century. In March 1894 Shanks patented a jet syphon closet that flushed the closet using a jet to charge a syphon that drew the waste from the basin instead of relying on the sheer force of the flush. The syphonic closet had originated in the United States in the 1870s but Shanks was just ahead of two chief main rivals with his patent: Thomas W. Twyford and George Jennings patented their versions a few months later.<br>
<br>Shanks's inventiveness was matched by the rapid expansion of the Tubal works. It grew to become one of the most conspicuous features of Barrhead, covering nearly 7 acres of land on the slope from the High Street to the waterside. By the 1890s the firm employed 600 workers in twenty different trades, from iron and brass founding to enamelling, connected with the production of baths, cisterns, and other sanitary appliances. In 1893 the firm had agencies in Manchester, Aberdeen, and Dublin as well as London and Glasgow. Its richly illustrated catalogue of that year confirmed the firm's place as one of the leading sanitary manufacturers in Britain.<br>
<br>Shanks was active in local affairs as a member of Neilston parish council, was manager of Barrhead United Presbyterian Church, and was prominent in the temperance cause. Following the Irish <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> he became a Liberal Unionist in national politics. His younger brother having predeceased him in 1893, he left the day-to-day running of the company to his son John and his nephew William. Left a &#145;helpless invalid&#146; by a stroke, he died at his home, Tubal Lodge, Barrhead, on 18 December 1895.<br>
<br>The business passed to his nephew William Shanks and his son John, who continued the expansion of the company, operating with three departments, home, export, and marine. In 1902 the firm established its own fireclay works&#151;the Victoria Pottery&#151;and in 1918 acquired the old-established earthenware manufacturers J. and M. Craig of Kilmarnock. Shanks remained a household name for bathroom fittings through the twentieth century, merging in 1969 with Armitage, an old-established Staffordshire firm of sanitary potters, to create the famous brand name Armitage Shanks.<br>
