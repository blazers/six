<span class="headword">Jowett,  John Henry</span>  (1863&#150;1923), <span class="occ">Congregational minister</span>, was born in Beaumont Town, Northowram, Halifax, on 25 August 1863, the fourth child of Josiah Jowett (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1905), tailor and draper, and his wife, Hannah Marshall (<i>d</i>. 1911). Both his parents were members of Halifax's Square Congregational Church, whose minister, Enoch Mellor, provided J. H. Jowett with the model for his own career.<br>
<br>After four years at Hipperholme grammar school, Halifax, Jowett became, at the age of fourteen, a pupil teacher at Victoria Street board school, and in 1882 entered the Airedale Congregational College in Bradford to prepare for the ministry. During his first year at Airedale he won a scholarship to the University of Edinburgh, from which he graduated in 1887. Twenty-three years later Edinburgh conferred on him the honorary degree of doctor of divinity. After returning to Airedale in 1887 he spent two terms at Mansfield College, Oxford, and in October 1889 began his first ministry at St James's Congregational Church, Newcastle upon Tyne. After six years in Newcastle he was called to the pastorate of Carr's Lane Congregational Church, Birmingham, following the death of R. W. Dale. While in Birmingham, Jowett took the initiative in raising &pound;25,000 for the establishment of the Digbeth Institute, in one of the city's poorest districts, which opened in January 1908 as a community centre for worship and recreation.<br>
<br>A holiday in the United States in the summer of 1909 led to an invitation to the pastorate of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, New York, reputedly the wealthiest church in the city. Despite a petition signed by 1400 members and worshippers at Carr's Lane and a memorial from Birmingham magistrates, Jowett accepted the invitation from New York in January 1911. It was this invitation that brought Jowett to the notice of the secular press, and he was reputed to have been enticed across the Atlantic by the offer of a large salary. In fact Jowett accepted the call to Fifth Avenue only on condition that his salary should be no more than the equivalent salary he had received at Carr's Lane. In New York, Jowett preached regularly to congregations of 1200&#150;1500 people, and although at times he regretted not being in England during the First World War he argued the justice of the allied case in the New York press.<br>
<br>In February 1917 Jowett received an invitation to return to England to succeed Campbell Morgan at the Congregational Westminster Chapel. While the British prime minister, David Lloyd George, wrote to Jowett urging him to return to England, the American president, Woodrow Wilson, urged him to remain in the United States. He accepted the call from Westminster Chapel, but only on condition that, with the United States entering the war in April 1917, he delay his return until the spring of 1918. Jowett began his ministry at Westminster Chapel on Whit Sunday 1918, preaching to a congregation which included David Lloyd George and his wife, but the ministry was to last only four years. In the summer of 1917 there appeared the first signs of the pernicious anaemia that would ultimately kill him. Ill health obliged him to retire from the pastorate of Westminster Chapel in December 1921, though he continued to preach at Sunday morning services until May 1922. In November 1922 he was made a Companion of Honour.<br>
<br>Jowett was a shy, humble man who was always slightly puzzled by the amount of public interest he aroused. He was tall, lean, balding with a full moustache, and always dressed fastidiously. He married, on 20 May 1890, Lizzie Ann, daughter of Francis Winpenny of Barnard Castle, and although they had no children of their own they adopted a daughter, Monica, in 1910.<br>
<br>Jowett's power as a preacher derived from a powerful, rich, musical voice and a masterly use of language. The burden of his message was &#145;the grace and love of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ&#146;, and having experienced no intellectual difficulties with Christianity himself he had little to say to those who had. From 1907 until 1922 he wrote a monthly devotional article for the <span class="italic">Christian World</span>, and published some twenty-five books, consisting largely of revised versions of his sermons. He served as chairman of the Congregational Union in 1906 and as president of the National Council of Evangelical Free Churches in 1910&#150;11. He was an enthusiastic advocate of church unity and caused a storm of protest when, in February 1920, he accepted an invitation from the dean of Durham to preach in the cathedral&#151;the first dissenter to preach in an English cathedral since the Commonwealth.<br>
<br>The last six months of Jowett's active life were devoted to a campaign designed to prevent another world war. In August 1922, despite growing weakness, he attended the conference, at Copenhagen, of the World Alliance for Promoting International Friendship through the Churches. And in the autumn he persuaded the archbishop of York, Cosmo Gordon Lang, to join him in a series of meetings designed to persuade British Christians to enlist as &#145;an act of personal dedication &hellip; in the cause of international brotherhood&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian World</span>). The campaign reached its climax with a meeting in London's Queen's Hall in December, but Jowett's speech there was to be his last. A few days later his health collapsed and he died on 19 December 1923 at Belmont, Surrey, survived by his wife. His funeral was held at Westminster Chapel on 22 December, followed by cremation at Golders Green.<br>
