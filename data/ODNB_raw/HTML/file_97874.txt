<span class="headword">Boys <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Illey]</span>,  Sibylle</span>, Lady Boys  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1370, <em>d.</em> in or after 1455), <span class="occ">literary patron</span>, was the daughter and heir of Sir Robert Illey of Plumstead Parva in Norfolk (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1398) and his wife, Katherine Gymyngham (<i>d</i>. 1417). Early evidence for Sibylle's considerable spirit is evinced by her mother's will, granting Lady Illey's goods to her daughter &#145;provided she behave herself civilly, and did not disturb her executors&#146;  (Blomefield and Parkin, 7.243). Sibylle married Sir Roger Boys of Honing and Ingham (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1422) and they had two children, who both predeceased their mother, Thomas dying in 1432 and Robert in 1450. Thomas left his mother all his silver, the furniture of his Norfolk chapel, and a horse called Powys, while Robert may well have been dominated by her, since in 1444 he gave her authority to oversee all his lands. Both Roger and Robert Boys joined the prestigious and influential Guild of St George at Norwich, whose members included leading members of important East Anglian families and of the Lancastrian court.<br>
<br>Sibylle Boys remained very wealthy throughout her long widowhood. In 1427 she sold the manor of Frenze, but she still had estates at Crostwight, Wilton, and Ridlington as well as Plumstead and Honing. She was well connected too, having business and social dealings with people who included members of the Paston family, Sir John Fastolf, and William de la Pole, successively earl, marquess, and duke of Suffolk. Her principal claim to fame has long been her appearance in the &#145;scribbling papers&#146; of the Norfolk justice and correspondent William (I) Paston who about 1430 received from her a recipe for a &#145;faire holsom drynk of ale&#146;  (<span class="italic">Paston Letters and Papers</span>, 1.14); like many late medieval widows, she was involved in the brewing industry. Sibylle Boys also appeared in the Paston correspondence in the summer of 1451, in letters concerning the forcible occupation of her manor of Holme Hale by Richard Southwell, an act that followed the abduction of her daughter-in-law Jane, Robert's widow, by Robert Langstrother. Jane's hand in marriage had been promised to Southwell, but the trouble at Holme Hale had a wider context in the disorders perpetrated by the men of the third duke of Norfolk in East Anglia following the fall of the duke of Suffolk and Jack Cade's rebellion. According to Margaret Paston, in June 1451 Sibylle went to London &#145;to compleyn to &thorn;e Kyng and to &thorn;e lordys there-of&#146;  (ibid., 1.241).<br>
<br>On 22 July 1451 Sibylle Boys was reportedly unable to go on pilgrimage to Rome due to old age and &#145;a certain hindrance&#146;&#151;no doubt an allusion to Southwell's activities  (<span class="italic">CEPR letters</span>, 10.525). Her excuses on this occasion were genuine, but she was not always regarded as a woman to be trusted. Probably in November 1452, in a correspondence about the possible sale of Holme Hale, Agnes Paston wrote that Sibylle &#145;hath seide a largely of o&thorn;er thing &thorn;at hath not be so&#146;  (<span class="italic">Paston Letters and Papers</span>, 1.38), and in a chancery action about the same time she was accused of having forged the will of her son Robert (of which she was herself the executor) in order to sell part of his estate, disregarding his intention that it should pass in its entirety to his wife and daughter.<br>
<br>Whatever her moral shortcomings, Sibylle Boys enjoyed a rich cultural life. In part she owed this to her marriage. In the fourteenth century the Boys family had made donations of land to local communities of women religious&#151;Franciscan nuns at Bruisyard and Augustinian canonesses at Campsey Ash&#151;and were responsible for commissioning the magnificent tomb of their ancestors Roger and Margaret Boys, which can still be seen at Ingham. Ingham Priory was itself a centre for the production of sophisticated art, architecture, and book crafts. Sibylle's own wealth was probably responsible for the rebuilding of St Andrew's Church at Holme Hale between 1431 and 1462 and for the mid-fifteenth-century benches there, beautifully carved with animal figures. She has also been identified as the patron of two of the poems of John Lydgate. She is the probable dedicatee of the &#145;Epistle to Sibille&#146;, a verse paraphrase of the description of the ideal housewife, or <i>mulier fortis</i>, whose virtues are enumerated in <span class="roman">Proverbs</span> 31: 10&#150;31 (references in the poem and an annotation by John Shirley allude to &#145;Cibille&#146;). The &#145;Epistle&#146; offers a fitting model for Lady Boys, presenting the household as a little factory and emphasizing industriousness and female management skills. It also contains numerous allusions to Chaucer's <span class="italic">Clerk's Tale</span>&#151;the story of patient Griselda, a rather different kind of exemplar. Sibylle has also been identified, though speculatively and without clear supporting evidence, as the patron of Lydgate's &#145;Tretise for Lauandres&#146;, a poem of advice on the correct ways to clean fine fabrics. Like the &#145;Epistle to Sibille&#146;, the &#145;Tretise for Lauandres&#146; illustrates the aesthetics of the gentry household, and shows Lydgate adapting his role as princely counsellor to gentry, and specifically domestic and female, audiences.<br>
<br>Described as being about eighty years old in 1451, Sibylle Boys is last recorded as still alive in a document of 1455 or 1456. Probably she died shortly afterwards. She was apparently buried at the Trinitarian priory at Ingham, next to her husband. A rubbing of the now vanished brass shows her with her hands clasped in prayer, an adoring small dog at her feet. Her husband is also shown with a dog, identified by a cartouche as &#145;Jakke&#146;. Following her death Sibylle Boys's considerable wealth was administered by her friend Sir William Calthorpe, who used the money in the 1490s to rebuild Creake Abbey, an Augustinian house near the north coast of Norfolk.<br>
