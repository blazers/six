<span class="headword">Pemberton,  Christopher Robert</span>  (1765&#150;1822), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Trumpington, Cambridgeshire, the fifth son of the Revd Jeremiah Pemberton (1714&#150;1800) and his wife, Anne, daughter of Charles Barron. His grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21821/', "Sir Francis Pemberton (bap. 1624, d. 1697)")</script>, lord chief justice. After education at Bury St Edmunds he entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1784, where he graduated MB in 1789 and MD in 1794. In 1796 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and, on 25 June, of the Royal College of Physicians, where he was Goulstonian lecturer in 1797 and censor in 1796, 1804, and 1811, and delivered the Harveian oration in 1806. He was in that year physician-extraordinary to the prince of Wales and to the duke of Cumberland, and he afterwards became physician-extraordinary to the king. He was physician to St George's Hospital, London, from 25 April 1800 until 1808.<br>
<br>In 1806 Pemberton published <span class="italic">A Practical Treatise on Various Diseases of the Abdominal Viscera</span>. It consists of eleven chapters, which discuss the treatment of the peritoneum, the liver, the gall bladder, the pancreas, the spleen, the kidneys, the stomach, the intestines, and enteritis. His most original observations are that the disease known as waterbrash was a result rather of an imperfect diet than of excess alcohol consumption  (p. 101); that cancer of some parts of the bowel may exist for a long time without grave constitutional symptoms  (p. 186); and that the over-exertion of muscles may lead to a condition indistinguishable from palsy  (p. 157). This last observation is one of the first contributions in English medical writings to the knowledge of the large group of diseases which became known as &#145;trade palsies&#146;. Pemberton recommends the use of a splint supporting the hand in cases of bad palsy of the muscles of the back of the forearm. The book shows Pemberton to have been an excellent clinical observer, who had paid close attention to morbid anatomy.<br>
<br>Pemberton was married twice: first to Sarah, and second, from August 1794, to Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1847), daughter of James Hamilton of Woodbrook, co. Tyrone. He suffered from intense facial neuralgia or tic douloureux, and the division of several branches of the trigeminal nerve by Sir Astley Cooper failed to give him any relief. He was obliged by his disease to give up practice and to leave London. Pemberton died of apoplexy at the home of his brother-in-law John Plumptre, at Fredville, Kent, on 31 July 1822.<br>
