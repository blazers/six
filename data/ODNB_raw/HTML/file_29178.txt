<span class="headword">Whately,  William</span>  (1583&#150;1639), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and puritan preacher</span>, was born at Banbury, Oxfordshire, on 21 May 1583, the son of Thomas Whately (1550&#150;1637), mercer, alderman, and twice mayor of the town, and his wife, Joyce Knight (<i>d</i>. 1612). He matriculated from Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1598 and graduated BA in 1601. While at Cambridge he frequented the sermons of two of the most renowned puritan preachers at the university, Laurence Chaderton and William Perkins. On 16 November 1602 he married Martha (<i>d</i>. 1641), the daughter of George Hunt, rector of Collingbourne Ducis, Wiltshire, and granddaughter of John Hunt, who had narrowly escaped martyrdom in Mary's reign. Whately was influenced by his father-in-law to pursue a clerical career and with this intention he was incorporated at Oxford at St Edmund Hall in 1602 and proceeded MA in 1604. In 1605 he was appointed curate and lecturer at Banbury and was instituted as vicar in 1610.<br>
<br>Whately's employment at Banbury allowed him to transmit the moderate scholarly puritanism that he had imbibed at Cambridge to an urban parish, which had already acquired a reputation as a puritan enclave. Members of Whately's immediate family had been actively involved in fostering puritanism in Banbury in their capacities as town governors. Thomas Whately and his brother Richard had been instrumental in getting the town's market cross removed in 1600 and Richard Whately had instigated an earlier campaign against maypoles in the parish. William Whately initially encountered some opposition at Banbury and was presented by a fellow curate in 1607 for administering communion to those who refused to kneel, for preaching against ceremonies, for not praying for the bishops, and not reading divine service or administering the sacrament of baptism. He was, however, supported in his ministry by his two brothers-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12417/', "Robert Harris (1580/81&#150;1658)")</script>, rector of Hanwell, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24977/', "Henry Scudder (d. 1652)")</script>, minister at Drayton, who at this stage in their careers met him on a weekly basis to translate and analyse chapters of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>.<br>
<br>Whately soon acquired a widespread reputation as a persuasive preacher and he was renowned for his eloquence and scriptural learning. He was involved in a number of local lectures by combination including that at Stratford upon Avon. Under Whately's aegis Banbury became so strongly associated with puritanism that Ben Jonson satirized the Banbury godly in the hypocritical character of Zeal-of-the-Land Busy in <span class="italic">Bartholomew Fair</span>, first performed in 1614 and published in 1631. After Whately's death Henry Scudder described him in the pulpit as &#145;both a terrible <i>Boanerges</i>, a sonne of Thunder, and also a <i>Barnabas</i>, a sonne of sweet consolation&#146;  (H. Scudder, &#145;The life and death of M. Whately&#146;, Whately, <span class="italic">Prototypes</span>, A2<i>v</i>&#150;A3<i>r</i>). Many of the sermons which Whately preached were published and his works on salvation were eagerly received by his contemporaries. <span class="italic">The Redemption of Time</span> (1606) was printed six times during Whately's lifetime and <span class="italic">The New-Birth, or, A Treatise of Regeneration</span> (1618) seven times. The famed dissenter Richard Baxter later recalled that in his youth Whately's works were &#145;very savoury to me: especially his <span class="italic">New Birth</span>, his <span class="italic">Care-Cloth</span> and his sermon of <span class="italic">Redeeming Time</span>&#146;  (Whately, <span class="italic">The Redemption of Time</span>, 1673, introduction by Baxter, A2<i>v</i>). Whately's sermons demonstrate that he espoused the Calvinist belief in predestination and regarded preaching as the &#145;chief and principal instrument&#146; to guide the elect into the necessary state of godliness  (Whately, <span class="italic">New-Birth</span>, 130).<br>
<br>Whately was also the author of two popular treatises on marriage, <span class="italic">A Bride-Bush</span> (1617) and <span class="italic">A Care-Cloth</span> (1624), which offer insights into early modern clerical assumptions about marriage and gender relations. Whately repudiated the first edition of <span class="italic">A Bride-Bush</span> of 1617 because it was published from notes without his permission. The second edition, which was printed in 1619, was much expanded and may be regarded as the definitive version of this work. It contradicted the first edition by arguing that it was lawful for a man to beat his wife if she had repeatedly and wilfully disobeyed him, an opinion which was at variance with the majority of English clerical authorities at the time. Whately also argued in both editions that divorce and remarriage were allowable for the innocent party on the grounds of adultery or desertion. This accorded with continental reformed practice, but was not accepted in England, and Whately was forced to recant his views on divorce by the high commission in 1621. The final edition of <span class="italic">A Bride-Bush</span> (1623) includes Whately's two-page disclaimer, although the offending passages had not been removed, according to Whately because of the carelessness of the printer.<br>
<br>Whately's willingness to recant his opinions illustrates his moderate approach to the theological debates of the time and in general he was careful to avoid controversy in his printed works. Whately was able to avoid direct confrontation with church authorities because Banbury was a peculiar jurisdiction and was exempt from episcopal visitation. Meetings of the peculiar court were held in Banbury and Whately himself sometimes acted as the presiding official.<br>
<br>Whately died at Banbury on 10 May 1639 and was buried four days later. His will included bequests to his wife, Martha, who was named as his executor and their three sons, William, an apothecary, Thomas, a clergyman, and George. Whately's links with other puritan clergy were marked by bequests to Robert Harris and Henry Scudder, and by the gift of his own ring to the aged John Dod, vicar of Fawsley, who had been deprived of his living at Hanwell some thirty years earlier and had helped to smooth the acceptance of both Whately and Harris by their parishioners. Whately's death was widely mourned by the godly, and Brilliana, Lady Harley, was among those who hoped for his recovery during his final illness.<br>
