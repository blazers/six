<span class="headword">Whitehead,  James</span>  (1812&#150;1885), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Oldham, the son of John Whitehead and his wife, Betty, whose surname may have been Bradbury. John Whitehead had a wide reputation in the district as a herbalist and dealer in simples, and it was his great ambition that his son should take up medicine as a profession; thus after working as a boy in a cotton mill Whitehead attended the Marsden Street school of medicine in Manchester, and was afterwards apprenticed first to Mr Clough of Lever Street, Manchester, and subsequently to Mr Lambert of Thirsk. On 11 September 1834 he became LSA and on 15 December 1835 he took his MRCS. He was admitted a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons after examination on 14 August 1845, and he graduated MD at the University of St Andrews in 1850. In 1859 he became MRCP (London).<br>
<br>In 1836 Whitehead visited France and Germany; he remained in Paris for two years, learning French and visiting the hospitals of that city. On his return to England in 1838 he began to practise as a general practitioner at 123 Oxford Street, Manchester, and in 1842 he was appointed demonstrator of anatomy at the Marsden Street school of medicine. In the same year he moved to 133 Oxford Street and married Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1820), daughter of Thomas Hayward Radcliffe of Bank House, Clitheroe. Her untimely death, of puerperal peritonitis, at twenty-four, on 20 September 1844, was a terrible blow to him, and influenced the future course of his career. Because of the nature of his wife's death Whitehead determined to devote his attention to the diseases of women and children; in order to further this aim, in conjunction with Dr A. Schoepf Merei, a Hungarian refugee, he took a house in Stevenson Square and opened the Clinical Hospital and Dispensary for Children. The hospital rapidly grew into the Manchester Clinical Hospital for Women and Children, which opened in 1856 with fifty-six beds and an attached convalescent home. As well as giving much of his time to this hospital Whitehead was lecturer on obstetrics at the Royal School of Medicine, and for fifteen years he acted as surgeon to St Mary's Hospital for Women and Children. In 1851 he moved to 87 Mosley Street, Manchester, where he conducted an extensive and lucrative practice until his retirement in 1881.<br>
<br>One of the most distinguishing features of Whitehead's career was his success in cases of sterility, a problem which he discussed in the monograph <span class="italic">On the Causes and Treatment of Abortion and Sterility</span> (1847; published in America, 1848). Other published works include <span class="italic">On the Transmission from Parent to Offspring of some Forms of Disease</span> (1851) and <span class="italic">Notes on the Rates of Mortality in Manchester</span> (1863). Jointly with Merei he published the first <span class="italic">Report of the Clinical Hospital, Manchester</span> (1856), and, under the pseudonym of Philothalos, <span class="italic">The Wife's Domain</span> (1860). He also contributed many excellent papers to various medical journals.<br>
<br>When he retired from practice Whitehead left Manchester to live at Fairlands, an estate he had purchased in Sutton, Surrey. He died there on 3 April 1885 of oesophageal cancer, and was buried in Ardwick cemetery, Manchester, in the vault which contained the remains of his wife.<br>
