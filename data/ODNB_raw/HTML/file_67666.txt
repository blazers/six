<span class="headword">Watson,  Alexandra Mary  Chalmers</span> <span class="st"> [Mona; <em>n&eacute;e </em>Alexandra Mary Geddes]</span>  (1872&#150;1936), <span class="occ">medical practitioner and head of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps</span>, was born in India on 31 May 1872, the eldest child of Acland (later Auckland) Campbell Geddes (1831&#150;1908), civil engineer, and his wife, Christina Helen MacLeod Geddes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Anderson (1850&#150;1914). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33360/', "Eric Campbell Geddes")</script> was among her younger siblings. Mona Geddes was educated at St Leonard's School, St Andrews. Her first choice of career was teaching and she went to Aberdeen to study, but her mother fell ill and Mona returned home to Edinburgh. During this period she became attracted to medicine; this was not surprising because her mother and another relative, Elizabeth Garrett Anderson&#151;the first woman to qualify as a doctor in England&#151;were both pioneers in the cause of the medical education of women. Mona began the study of medicine in 1891 in the Medical College for Women, Edinburgh, of which her mother was one of the founders. Those were the days, according to the <span class="italic">Medical Women's Federation Quarterly Review</span> of October 1936, when to be a woman medical student in Edinburgh almost meant social ostracism: &#145;Certainly, although the era of rotten eggs and flour had passed, the throwing of contemptuous glances and sneering remarks was still in vogue.&#146;<br>
<br>After graduating MB CM at Edinburgh University in 1896 Mona Geddes went to London, where she spent a year in Plaistow, working as medical officer in the Maternity District Association and for six months in Dr Barnardo's Homes, Kent. Her work at Plaistow formed the subject of her MD thesis, using a record of more than 1000 confinements with a mortality rate of just over 1 per 1000. She returned to Edinburgh and took her MD degree on 30 July 1898. The <span class="italic">Scots Pictorial</span> (8 Sept 1917), in commenting on her graduation, reported: &#145;The men took the innovation gallantly, and when the young lady, modest and charming, but wearing that air of immense capability that distinguishes all her family, appeared to be &#147;capped&#148;, she was greeted with the very heartiest applause.&#146; She had delayed her wedding until she could write MD after her name, and on the afternoon of her graduation day was married to Dr Douglas Chalmers Watson. The two then set up private practice together in 11 Walker Street, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Chalmers Watson's years of private practice in Edinburgh were strenuous for she had her home and family responsibilities as well as many outside interests. One of her patients is on record as saying: &#145;She never left you without your realising that you had been given not merely professional skill and advice but a part of herself.&#146; While her husband specialized in nutrition, Mona Chalmers Watson&#151;inspired by Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett, a relative by marriage&#151;was drawn towards the suffrage movement, but she departed from Dame Millicent's constitutional organization and joined the ranks of the militant Women's Social and Political Union. Although she was not called upon to fight as a &#145;shock trooper&#146; herself, her support was always active and not passive.<br>
<br>Although Chalmers Watson had two young sons, Irvine and Rupert, she still found time to take part in the development of the Queen Mary Nursing Home, and in the founding of the Elsie Inglis Hospital for Women, a pioneer institution of its kind, and to support actively the Patriotic Food League, the Women's Emergency Corps&#151;of which she was honorary secretary&#151;and the Scottish Women's Medical Association, of which she later became president. For a few years she was on the staff of the Edinburgh (Bruntsfield) Hospital for Women and Children and she assisted her husband in the editorship of the <span class="italic">Encyclopedia medica</span> (1899&#150;1910), a work of fifteen volumes, in which she wrote the article on invalid feeding. She and Douglas also published <span class="italic">Food and Feeding in Health and Disease</span> (1910) and <span class="italic">The Book of Diet</span> (1913). She was for a time a manager of the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, and was also one of the two secretaries of the Queen's Institute of District Nursing. She also did much in securing the introduction of women medical students into Edinburgh University on an equal footing with the men. In addition to her professional activities she found time to become the first president of the Scottish Women's Hockey Association.<br>
<br>In December 1916, after two years of war and faced with the mounting toll of slaughter in the trenches, the War Office considered the formation of a women's corps to undertake some of the non-combatant duties in France. This scheme was supported by Sir Neville Macready, the adjutant-general, and the commander in the field, General Sir Douglas Haig. The urgency of the situation demanded swift action, and the director of recruiting at the War Office, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33359/', "Brigadier-General Sir Auckland Geddes")</script>, Mona Chalmers Watson's brother, called his sister to London to attend a meeting of leaders of women's organizations on 26 January 1917. Lord Derby, who convened the meeting, opposed the full enlistment of women and, although discussion ranged over several topics, no firm decision was taken on the formation of a women's corps.<br>
<br>Sir Auckland urged his sister to seek a private interview with Macready. Their meeting lasted for ninety minutes, during which time Mona submitted her ideas in the form of rough notes that she had specially prepared. When she returned to London on Friday 9 February 1917 Sir Neville asked her to head the new corps, saying that although Lord Derby favoured the appointment of &#145;a lady of title&#146;, he personally preferred a professional woman for the post  (Terry, 40). She accepted on condition that she could appoint a deputy to command the women's forces in France; her choice fell on Helen Gwynne-Vaughan. It was an ideal partnership: Mona had a commanding and attractive presence, yet was charming, motherly, and good-humoured, with a record of superb organizational skills, while Helen was striking and statuesque with an hauteur born of her aristocratic background, yet impulsive and at times undiplomatic&#151;they complemented each other perfectly. The combination of Mona's tact and Helen's forceful determination could hardly have been bettered and it contributed greatly to the success of the large organization which they were to head.<br>
<br>The Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) was formally instituted by an Army Council instruction, dated 7 July 1917, and Mona Chalmers Watson described its formation as a step forward in two directions: &#145;It is an advance of the women's movement and it is a national advance&#146;, she wrote in the <span class="italic">B.E.U. Monthly Record</span> in November 1917. &#145;Women have now a direct and officially recognised share in the task of our armies both at home and overseas.&#146; Mona was appointed chief controller of the WAAC, equivalent to the rank of brigadier-general, with an annual salary of &pound;500. The official headquarters of the corps were established at Devonshire House in Piccadilly, London. Eighteen months of a life beyond their imaginings, doing a man's job in what had been strictly a man's world, lay ahead of Mona Chalmers Watson in London, Helen Gwynne-Vaughan in France, and the women they recruited. When it was all over they would return to a new Britain, and some of them would build on the feminist foundations that were even then being laid. During these early months of the WAAC Mona Chalmers Watson undertook the immense task of recruiting 40,000 women. In a recruiting pamphlet she wrote: &#145;This is the great opportunity for every strong, healthy and active woman not already employed on work of national importance to offer her services to her country&#146;  (Terry, 48). She devoted all of her energies to the task and, on 25 August 1917, she was among the first recipients of the newly instituted CBE. By February 1918 Mona realized that the strain of running the WAAC and also undertaking her domestic duties was proving too much: when one of her sons became seriously ill after an appendectomy she decided to resign so that she could return to her family in Edinburgh. There were many tributes to Mona Chalmers Watson's work. The <span class="italic">Ladies' Pictorial</span> on 20 February 1918 said she had &#145;nobly done her bit&#146; and the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span> reported on the same day that she &#145;had organised and set going that most useful corps with conspicuous success&#146;. There is no doubt that the cause of women's suffrage, for which she had worked more directly in the past, was advanced by her clear-sighted and capable direction of the WAAC.<br>
<br>In 1923 the Chalmers Watsons inherited a farm, Fenton Barns, near North Berwick, East Lothian, from Douglas's uncle, James Glendinning; there they began the task of breeding a herd of tuberculin-tested cattle. In the next few years the dairy farm became renowned across Europe as a pioneer in experiments directed towards improving the quality of milk and the production and distribution of certified milk for the safer feeding of children. The irradiation of milk, its use in the feeding of premature infants, the production of milk with a specially digestible curd, and other associated problems occupied Mona Chalmers Watson's thought and energies.<br>
<br>When women were given the vote in 1918 Mona Chalmers Watson became the first president of the Edinburgh Women Citizens' Association. She was also instrumental in securing funds for the development of the Women's United Services Club in Drumsheugh Gardens, Edinburgh, and she was a director of Time and Tide Publishing Company. When news of Mona Chalmers Watson's death on 7 August 1936&#151;at the home of her brother Sir Auckland Geddes at Frensham, Rolvenden, Kent&#151;reached Edinburgh, the first stunned reaction was the question of what all of the women's organizations would do without her. A contemporary wrote in <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> (8 Aug 1936): &#145;Societies, hospitals, Queen's Nurses, Boards were upheld by her support and inspired by her practical energy.&#146; She was notable for her clear thinking and her opinions had a weight beyond her own estimate of them. As a hostess she was charming, with a natural ease and grace.<br>
<br>&#145;It has been an honour&#146;, she told a medical contemporary when reviewing her career, &#145;to have lived through such great times for women, and to know that the generation after us will not have the same fight for liberty&#146;. Her contribution to feminist causes was considerable and her work as the first head of the WAAC, later the Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps, laid the foundations for the Auxiliary Territorial Service in the Second World War, and for the Women's Royal Army Corps which it became in 1949.<br>
