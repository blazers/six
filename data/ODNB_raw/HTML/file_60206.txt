<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fraser,  George Sutherland</span>  (1915&#150;1980), <span class="occ">poet and literary scholar</span>, was born on 8 November 1915 in Glasgow, one of the two children of George Sutherland Fraser (1885&#150;1942), a member of the legal staff of Glasgow corporation, and his wife, Ada Grace, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones (1887&#150;1952). The latter is described by William Hall as having been &#145;a talented musician&#146;  (Hall, 51); she was a descendant of the same Johnson family that produced Samuel Johnson, the hymn-writer, and which was collaterally connected with Dr Samuel Johnson. Fraser attended the primary section of Glasgow Academy, but when the family moved to Aberdeen in 1924 (the father was appointed deputy town clerk, and promoted town clerk in the following year) he went to Aberdeen grammar school.<br>
<br>To Fraser, Glasgow and Aberdeen were respectively &#145;romantic&#146; and &#145;classic&#146; cities, symbolic of the two aspects of his own temperament. In his autobiography, <span class="italic">A Stranger and Afraid</span> (posthumously published, 1983), he wrote that &#145;the relaxing air of Glasgow&#146; encouraged in him &#145;a sad and helpless dreaminess&#146;, while &#145;the brisk, cold air of Aberdeen&#146; woke him up and &#145;brisked&#146; him &#145;into an unaccustomed alertness&#146;  (p. 37). For his poetry, however, Aberdeen was the more significant. In poems such as &#145;Social Pleasures&#146;, &#145;Problems of a Poet&#146;, &#145;A Letter to Anne Ridler&#146;, &#145;A Winter Letter&#146;, and especially in &#145;Home Town Elegy&#146;, the Aberdonian environment provided exactly what Fraser needed to fulfil his aim (expressed in a letter to David Daiches) of exploring &#145;personal and local themes in a mood of gently restrained lyricism&#146;  (<span class="italic">THES</span>).<br>
<br>In 1933 Fraser went to St Andrews University as a bursary student, and in 1937 took a joint honours degree in English and history, although he also acquired a love for moral philosophy, which he had to take as part of the more general preparation for an honours degree required by the Scottish university system. While still an undergraduate he made something of a reputation for himself as a writer and student journalist, and on returning to Aberdeen he became a cub reporter on the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Press and Journal</span>. At the outbreak of war in 1939 he volunteered for the army and joined the Black Watch&#151;motivated by a patriotism which, as his poem &#145;Meditation of a Patriot&#146; suggests, was distinctly non-jingoistic, and perhaps also by the example of his father, who had been an officer in the Highland light infantry during the First World War. Fraser, however, was anything but a man of military cast; he belonged to nature's &#145;awkward squad&#146; and could never master the intricacies of drill. He was transferred to the RASC, and spent most of his service in the Middle East as a warrant officer carrying out journalistic and editorial duties, first with the army public relations directorate in Cairo (1941&#150;2), and then in Eritrea in charge of the <span class="italic">Eritrean Daily News</span> (1942&#150;4). He was posted back to Cairo in 1944, and then returned to London where he was demobilized in December 1945. Poems such as &#145;Egypt&#146; and &#145;Monologue for a Cairo Evening&#146; came out of this experience.<br>
<br>Fraser's first volumes of poetry belong to the 1940s, including <span class="italic">The Fatal Landscape</span> (1941), <span class="italic">Home Town Elegy</span> (1944), and <span class="italic">The Traveller has Regrets</span> (1948). At this time he also became involved with the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96344', "New Apocalypse")</script> movement centred on J. F. Hendry and Henry Treece. Fraser became their critical spokesman and he wrote the introduction to the movement's 1941 anthology, <span class="italic">The White Horseman</span>. He argued that New Apocalypse was a flexible philosophy &#145;which hardly dictates to anyone how he is to write or feel&#146;  (p. 6); its controlling ideal was &#145;the living completeness of man&#146;, reflected in a balanced art form in which &#145;intellect and will&#146; were as necessary as the creatively potent outpourings from the unconscious more obviously associated with a cult of the &#145;apocalyptic&#146;  (p. 3). Although this was very much a young man's manifesto, and the movement itself one with which Fraser associated himself only for a short time, the desire to reconcile emotional upheaval and rational structures remained with him throughout his life.<br>
<br>After the war Fraser returned, not to Aberdeen, but to a flat in Beaufort Street, Chelsea, London, where his mother and sister, Jean (to whom he was most closely attached), had moved after his father's death in 1942. The life to which he dedicated himself now was that of poet and writer, existing, often precariously, on reviews and articles for literary journals, including the <span class="italic">TLS</span>, the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, and the &#145;quality&#146; Sunday newspapers, and broadcasts for the BBC Third Programme. Another inhabitant of Beaufort Street was a young woman, Eileen Lucy (Paddy) Andrew (<i>b</i>. 1918), daughter of Melville and Evelyn Andrew. Paddy, who had taken an English degree at St Anne's College, Oxford, and was then working at the Board of Trade, shared Fraser's passion for poetry, and it was not long before they fell in love and were married, on 30 August 1946. Their house in Great Ormond Street, Bloomsbury, soon became a kind of unofficial cultural centre for young, aspiring writers.<br>
<br>Among other commissions undertaken by Fraser at this time were two travel books on Scotland and <span class="italic">News from South America</span> (1949), an account of a journey to Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, and Chile made as a member of a cultural mission sponsored by the Hudson Institute. In Buenos Aires he had interviews with Borges and Per&oacute;n, and attended a political rally addressed by both Evita and General Per&oacute;n. The country which most impressed him, however, was Chile. He liked Santiago with its &#145;affectionate flavour of use&#146;  (<span class="italic">News</span>, 167) and its spectacular backdrop of the Andes; but the deepest impression was made by his encounter with Pablo Neruda, at whose house he stayed. Neruda was for Fraser a type of the heroic man of action conjoined with the uncompromising man of letters. Although his own position as an uncommitted liberal set him aside from the dangerous extremism of Neruda, he was one of the first to recognize the outstanding quality of the Chilean writer's work; and this meeting led Fraser to translating Neruda's poetry.<br>
<br>In 1953 Fraser's first major critical work was published&#151;<span class="italic">The Modern Writer and his World</span>. This was the fruit of his being appointed in 1950 to succeed William Empson as cultural attach&eacute; to the British embassy in Japan. In the preface he describes it modestly as an attempt &#145;to provide Japanese students of English literature, who had been cut off from contact with us during the war, with a fairly clear guide-book to modern tendencies&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Modern Writer</span>, 7). It is more than that, however. Ranging from the late nineteenth-century symbolists to mid-twentieth century literature, it offers a highly readable survey which manages to be both just to individual writers and perceptive in its treatment of their relation to their times.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Impressions of Japan and other Essays</span> (1952) and <span class="italic">Three Philosophical Essays</span> (n.d.) also belong to the Japan visit. In the latter Fraser confesses that he would have liked to become a philosopher, but realized that he did not have a sufficiently abstract frame of mind. These essays are concerned with the exploration of personality and Sartrean existentialism, but drift towards the anecdotal mode which became increasingly characteristic of Fraser's later writings. He puts the emphasis on social interaction rather than logical analysis, and typically concludes that &#145;truth, like personality, is made actual in the response of one mind to another, and like human life itself it is a developing project&#146;  (Fraser, <span class="italic">Three Philosophical Essays</span>, 52).<br>
<br>In 1958 Fraser exchanged his absorbing, but insecure, literary life in London for a post in the English department of the newly chartered University of Leicester. The young poet was turning into the middle-aged family man (he and Paddy had three children: the eldest, Helen, was born in 1949, the second, George, in 1951, and the third, Katie, in 1952); and his growing domestic responsibilities made a regular income and the more settled pattern of life offered by a provincial city both necessary and desirable. University life offered him the chance to focus on the critical work that now seemed to be his main strength, and to pursue his fascination with modern writers in greater depth. A number of volumes followed including <span class="italic">Vision and Rhetoric</span> (1959), <span class="italic">Lawrence Durrell</span> (1968), <span class="italic">Metre, Rhythm, and Free Verse</span> (1970), <span class="italic">Essays on Twentieth Century Poets</span> (1977)&#151;which overlaps considerably with <span class="italic">Vision and Rhetoric: Alexander Pope</span> (1978)&#151;and the posthumously published <span class="italic">A Short History of English Poetry</span> (1981). All are informed with that balanced awareness of &#145;romantic&#146; and &#145;classic&#146;, visionary and rationally moderate, which runs as a theme throughout Fraser's life, but there is an undeniable decline in the forcefulness and originality of the later work. Although he was interested in the various manifestations of literary theory which British universities eagerly adopted from France and America in the 1960s and 1970s, and which his philosophical interests particularly qualified him to analyse and assess, his own work continued in an earlier vein of warm appreciation illuminated with passages of practical criticism.<br>
<br>In 1963 Fraser was appointed reader in poetry at Leicester, and he spent part of the following year as visiting professor at the University of Rochester in New York state. Increasingly, his vocation was becoming that of a teacher; in 1975 he said of himself: &#145;Poetry is my main gift. But to earn a living I became first a literary journalist, then a university teacher, and now teaching, especially the teaching of poetry, has become as true a vocation as writing poetry&#146;  (King and Smith, 13). His lectures, though on occasion inclined to the rambling and diffuse, were most often a blend of inspired, off-the-cuff analysis and wide-ranging literary reference (he seemed to have read everything, and to be able to deliver an astute judgement on any author or subject). But his forte was the seminar and, still more, private or after-dinner conversation, where his penchant for anecdote and reminiscence had full scope.<br>
<br>Despite the predominance of critical work and teaching, Fraser did have the fortune to experience a late resurgence of his talent for poetry. A new volume, <span class="italic">Conditions</span>, appeared in 1969, and he continued to write occasional poems in the 1970s. These were gathered with the previously published work in <span class="italic">Poems of G. S. Fraser</span>, edited by his friends Ian Fletcher and John Lucas (1981). The later poems continue the formal neatness and rhymed precision of the earlier ones, but the themes are less parochial and the verse movement more colloquially liberated. Although the need for balance is still their underlying concern, they are also more coolly discursive than the plangently elegiac earlier poems, more cosmopolitan, and more urbane.<br>
<br>Illness overshadowed Fraser's life in the late 1970s. He retired from the University of Leicester in 1979, but after little more than six months of leisure he died, at his home, 19 Guilford Road, Leicester, of heart disease on 3 January 1980. He was buried in Leicester. In later years his hair, and his appearance generally, was often untidy in a rumpled, academic way; he had a broad forehead, thick eyebrows, dreamy but slightly ironic, bespectacled, hazel eyes, and rubicund cheeks. His voice, long since Anglicized, nevertheless still carried a hint of the lilting, Scottish intonation. Fraser was survived by his wife and their three children.<br>
