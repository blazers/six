<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cleveley family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1747&#150;1809), <span class="occ">marine painters</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_76422"></a><span class="headword">John Cleveley the elder</span>  (<em>c.</em>1712&#150;1777)<span class="occ"></span>, the son of Samuel Cleveley, a joiner of Newington Butts, Southwark, who was already dead when, perhaps aged about fourteen, his son was apprenticed on 3 November 1726 to another joiner, Thomas Miller. Later he was turned over to John Hall, a shipwright and Deptford boat builder. He first appears in the Deptford rate books (St Paul's parish) in July 1742, for a house in or near Slade's Court, and on 9 June 1743 was sworn a freeman of the Shipwrights' Company on the testimony of Hall and William Houlder, shipwright, although he must then have been long out of indentures. Cleveley's main career was spent as a shipwright in the royal dockyard at Deptford. He lived in King's Yard Row, Dogg Street, at least from 1747, died there in May 1777, and was buried on 21 May at the parish church of St Paul's, Deptford. Letters of administration granted to his widow, Sarah, on 14 June 1778 refer to him both as lately of that parish and as &#145;Carpenter belonging to his Majesty's Ship the <i>Victory</i> in the pay of his M<sup>y</sup>s Navy&#146;  (General Register Office for England, AA 1777 Farrant). <i>Victory</i> was held in ordinary (reserve) at Chatham from her launch in 1765 until first commissioned for sea in March 1778, so Cleveley may latterly have been attached to her in some capacity, although not as her regular carpenter.<br>
<br>How Cleveley learned to paint is unknown, although it may have been been through association with ship painters, whose opportunities increased from 1704 when the Admiralty reduced carved ship decoration in favour of painting. The earliest date yet found on his work is 1747, and he specialized in shipping and Thames shipbuilding and launching scenes, especially at the Deptford yard. He also produced other marine views (including of shipbuilding in East Anglia), Hanoverian comings and goings in the royal yachts, sea fights, and ship portraits. The last tend to be repetitive, often with little more than a change of name. Little of the artist's work was engraved, but he contributed shipping to the prints of Sheerness, Chatham, and Plymouth dockyards (1755&#150;6) by Thomas Milton, and possibly those of Deptford, Woolwich, and Portsmouth (1753&#150;4) in the same set. Cleveley was a good draughtsman and colourful painter. His art combines a valuable historical record with much human detail and at its best has an unpretentious grandeur. While not the equal of Samuel Scott, he must have known the latter's work and perhaps that of Canaletto's English period (1746&#150;55). He exhibited at the Free Society from 1764 to 1776, but confusion at the time with his son <a href="#cosubject_5636">John [<i>see below</i>]</a> makes it unclear how many of the forty-three pictures listed under his name for those years may have been by the younger man. His work is widely dispersed, but the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, has sixteen paintings, the most impressive being a fictitious placing of the <i>Royal George</i> (launched in 1756) off Deptford at the launch of the <i>Cambridge</i> in 1755. This too was a composition he repeated. No portrait of Cleveley is known, but he sometimes seems to have included himself in his work: a view of the <i>Buckingham</i> on the stocks at Deptford (dated 1752 and also at Greenwich) shows a sturdy, respectably dressed figure drawing the scene depicted.<br>
<br>Cleveley and his wife, Sarah (1722&#150;1798), had seven known children: John and Hannah (<i>bap</i>. 1744 and 1747) presumably died in infancy. Another Hannah was baptized in 1750 and Rebecca in 1754. A younger son, James (<i>bap</i>. 29 June 1752), was a ship's carpenter and served as such under Captain Cook in the <i>Resolution</i>, on Cook's third Pacific voyage (1776&#150;80).<br>
<br>The couple's other two children were <a name="cosubject_5636"></a><span class="headword">John Cleveley the younger</span>  (1747&#150;1786)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_5637"></a><span class="headword">Robert Cleveley</span>  (1747&#150;1809)<span class="occ"></span>, twin sons born at Deptford on 25 December 1747 and baptized on 7 January 1748 at St Paul's, Deptford, as were all their siblings. John was apprenticed to his shipwright father on 3 May 1763 but did not complete this training. Instead, probably through his father's artistic connections, he learned to paint in watercolours and do tinted drawings from Paul Sandby, then the drawing instructor at the Royal Military Academy in nearby Woolwich. He was presumably taught oil painting by his father, and was arguably a better painter, but he was known primarily as a watercolour painter and draughtsman, winning a premium for this from the Society of Arts. Many of his drawings were also engraved. While his father signed his paintings &#145;I. Cleveley&#146;, he signed as &#145;Jn<sup>o</sup> Cleveley, Junr.&#146; at least until 1782. He first exhibited two drawings at the Free Society in 1767, but, of the oil paintings listed under his father's name there up to 1776, some were probably his, as were all twenty-one from 1778 to 1783. All thirty-eight works credited to John Cleveley at the Royal Academy from 1770 to 1786 were presumably his. After first showing drawings there in 1770&#150;71 he was appointed draughtsman to (Sir) Joseph Banks's expedition to Iceland in 1772, and he exhibited two drawings of Iceland at the Royal Academy in 1773. He is widely reported to have been on Captain Phipps's Arctic expedition, which sailed in the <i>Racehorse</i> and <i>Carcass</i> on 3 June 1773, an error springing from his various drawings of it, including those engraved in Phipps's published account and elsewhere. It is now known that these were done at home from sketches brought back by Midshipman Philippe d'Auvergne, later last duc de Bouillon (1754&#150;1816). Cleveley's views of this subject are mainly in the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the National Maritime Museum, but which were the pair exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1774 is uncertain. On 23 June 1773 Cleveley himself was present at George III's review of the fleet at Spithead; he exhibited two drawings of it at the academy in each of the years 1774 and 1775, of which three are now in the National Maritime Museum. He also painted this in oils. In 1774 he moved from Deptford to Brewer Street, Golden Square, and from 27 August 1775 to January 1776 he made a voyage to Lisbon. This also produced exhibited views, and a bound-up volume of thirty-seven watercolour and wash drawings from it was sold at Sothebys in 1983 and subsequently dispersed. A number of later watercolours, one shown at the academy in 1781 (and a painting of 1784), were of episodes on Captain Cook's last Pacific voyage (1776&#150;80) and four engraved in aquatint by Francis Jukes were advertised as being based on sketches brought back by his brother James, in the <i>Resolution</i>.<br>
<br>John Cleveley the younger's exhibited oil works show a broad range of marine subjects, mostly of British and north European situation, but there are few in public collections: the National Maritime Museum has only one confirmed example, with drawings, which are more widely encountered. He died in London on 25 June 1786, probably in Pimlico, which was his Royal Academy exhibiting address from 1783. Nothing has emerged to support the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> inference that he may have died in Deptford, whence he had last sent a picture to the academy in 1781&#151;probably from his mother's house, since she remained at King's Yard Row until her death in March 1798.<br>
<br>Robert Cleveley was John Cleveley the younger's twin brother. There is no report of his being taught, as John was, by Paul Sandby, although opportunity and his fine watercolour style make this possible, and he, too, probably learned oil painting from his father. In 1795 a Deptford Dockyard official told Joseph Farington that &#145;when young he was bred as a Caulker&#146;, but disliked it, was laughed at for working in gloves, and gave it up  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 2.308). Probably through his father, he instead gained the &#145;interest&#146; of Captain William Locker, a significant naval patron of artists. On 4 October 1770 he volunteered for the navy in London, and on 23 October was appointed Locker's clerk in the frigate <i>Thames</i>. He remained in her when George Vandeput took over command in 1773. Vandeput was later described as &#145;a judicious critic in the arts [and] a great admirer of pictures, particularly those on nautical subjects&#146;  (<span class="italic">Naval Chronicle</span>, May 1800, 332). In December 1773 Cleveley followed Vandeput into the <i>Asia</i>, which sailed for the North American station until 1777. According to Farington, Vandeput was &#145;his great friend&#146;  (ibid.) in career terms, and on his return he was appointed purser of the storeship <i>Camel</i> (on 31 October 1777), then of the <i>Monsieur</i> (in July 1780). In July 1783 Cleveley was with Vandeput when he took Prince William (later duke of Clarence and William IV) to Hanover, in the royal yacht <i>Princess Augusta</i>, and sailed with him on her again in June 1786 when princes Ernest, Augustus, and Adolphus were sent to G&ouml;ttingen University. On both occasions he was officially mustered as &#145;assistant to the Clerk of the Kitchen&#146; in the royal entourage. He was also purser of the <i>Melampus</i> (from August 1783), the <i>Portland</i> (December 1783), the <i>Swiftsure</i> (July 1802), and the <i>Sussex</i> (from January 1805 until his death). Most of these ships were stationed in home ports&#151;the <i>Portland</i> &#145;in ordinary&#146; and on harbour service at Portsmouth throughout his nearly eighteen years in her, and the <i>Sussex</i> a hospital ship at Sheerness. This explains both how he also sustained a painting career and why he was sometimes referred to as an artist as &#145;of the Royal Navy&#146; at least until 1795. His will, dated 1808, names him as purser of the <i>Sussex</i> and circumstantially confirms that he was the Robert Cleveley who married Catherine Collett or Collitt at St Pancras on 31 January 1787.<br>
<br>Although Robert Cleveley produced shipping and coastal views at home and abroad, he was best-known as a painter of the naval actions of the American War of Independence and the French Revolutionary Wars, of which many were engraved. He exhibited fifty-one works, including drawings, at the Royal Academy from 1780 to 1803, but not in all years. This was as an &#145;Honorary Exhibitor&#146; from 1780 to 1786 and as &#145;of the Navy&#146; from his second appearance in 1782 until 1788, when he sent pictures from the first of three Westminster addresses. Two huge and admired paintings of the beginning and end of Lord Howe's victory at the battle of 1 June 1794 were shown at the premises of the printseller A. C. de Poggi, at 91 New Bond Street, in 1795&#150;6, from which T. Medland and B. T. Pouncy engraved large subscription prints. A separate text booklet includes Cleveley's large fold-out plan of the battle, probably the most detailed of the period. The oils remained together until auctioned at Sothebys in 1981. In 1796 J. F. Rigaud also employed Cleveley to &#145;retouch&#146; the shipping in his painted ceiling of the court room at Trinity House (now destroyed). From 1791 or 1792 Cleveley was marine draughtsman to the duke of Clarence, and he also became marine painter to the latter's elder brother, the prince of Wales. There are four paintings by him in the National Maritime Museum, which also has drawings and prints, and many elsewhere. In his will, dated 4 April 1808, he gave his address as &#145;late of Devonshire Street, Portland Place&#146;. He died on 28 September 1809 after accidentally falling 25 feet down a cliff at Dover while visiting a relative there with his wife. A half-length portrait of Cleveley in civilian dress, stipple-engraved by Freeman after Sir William Beechey, was published in the <span class="italic">Monthly Mirror</span> in 1810.<br>
