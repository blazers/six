<span class="headword">Gordon, Sir  William Eden  Evans-</span>  (1857&#150;1913), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 8 August 1857 in Chatham, Kent, the youngest son of Major-General Charles Spalding Evans-Gordon and his wife, Catherine Rose, daughter of Dr Rose of Inverness. He was educated at Cheltenham College and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He entered the army in July 1876 and after joining the 67th foot regiment in January 1877 was posted to India. After being made a captain in the Madras staff corps in July 1878, he was promoted major in July 1896. During his service, he acted as aide-de-camp to the governor of Madras, as a boundary settlement officer, and accompanied the viceroy, the marquess of Dufferin, as an interpreter on several tours. He undertook various roles within the foreign department of the government of India, and from 1888 to 1892 was assistant secretary. On 2 February 1892 Evans-Gordon married Julia Charlotte Sophia, marchioness of Tweeddale (1846&#150;1937), widow of Arthur Hay, the ninth marquess, and widow of Sir John Rose, first baronet. She was the daughter of Keith William Stewart-Mackenzie of Seaforth and his first wife, Hannah Charlotte Hope-Vere. She and Evans-Gordon had no children. He retired from the army in May 1897.<br>
<br>In March 1898 Evans-Gordon unsuccessfully contested for the Conservatives one of the London county council seats for Stepney in the East End of London. During the council campaign the sitting Conservative MP for Stepney died and Evans-Gordon was selected as the candidate to replace him in parliament. He was narrowly defeated in the by-election, but won the seat in the October 1900 general election Conservative landslide. Evans-Gordon rose to greatest prominence after his election for his persistent and forthright call for restrictions to be placed upon immigration into Britain. Large numbers of Jewish immigrants had continued to settle in the East End of London from the 1880s, and the &#145;alien question&#146; was an issue gaining widespread attention in Stepney and surrounding seats. Evans-Gordon took up these local concerns with a passion and became one of the leading proponents of restrictive legislation.<br>
<br>Soon after his election Evans-Gordon was instrumental in the establishment of the British Brothers' League (BBL), a purportedly working-class anti-immigration body. The BBL attracted large crowds to a series of public meetings across the East End; the first of these was held in Stepney in May 1901. By 1902 the BBL's membership stood at 12,000 and it had collected 45,000 signatures in support of its stand. Evans-Gordon toured eastern Europe to study the Jewish immigration question, and wrote of his journey in his book <span class="italic">The Alien Immigrant</span>, published in 1903. He concluded that &#145;it is a fact that the settlement of large aggregations of Hebrews in a Christian land has never been successful&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Alien Immigrant</span>, 248).<br>
<br>Evans-Gordon's role at the head of a popular anti-immigration movement gave him a great deal of influence in setting the agenda of the government on the issue. He formed a committee of MPs pledged to vote for restriction&#151;the parliamentary pauper immigration committee&#151;and this played an important part in forcing the government to establish a royal commission on alien immigration in 1902. As a member of the commission, Evans-Gordon was &#145;the individual who dominated the whole investigation&#146;  (Kushner, 37). Many of the witnesses called by the commission were organized by the BBL. The commission's report was presented in August 1903 and recommended a range of measures to restrict immigration. These were largely incorporated into the <span class="roman">Aliens Act</span> of 1905 which, according to David Feldman, Evans-Gordon &#145;played a major role in drafting&#146;  (Feldman, 75). With a great deal of justification, he was regarded by Chaim Weizmann, later the first president of Israel, as the &#145;father of the <span class="roman">Aliens Act</span>&#146;  (Gainer, 182).<br>
<br>Evans-Gordon held his seat in general election in January 1906, against the trend of the Liberal landslide. His victory has often been attributed to support for his stand on immigration, though this is open to question for he also stood on a programme of social reform, including cheaper working-class housing, poor-law reform, and old-age pensions. After 1906 Evans-Gordon continued to campaign on immigration, frequently attacking the new government for failing to enforce the <span class="roman">Aliens Act</span>. He told one large public meeting in Shoreditch that &#145;War has been declared on you by the Liberal Government, the friends of every country but their own&#146;  (<span class="italic">East London Advertiser</span>, 7 April 1906, 5). He announced his resignation from parliament in April 1907, largely as a result of his own ill health and that of his wife. After his retirement he continued periodically to write on the immigration question.<br>
<br>Evans-Gordon, who was knighted in 1905, was described as a tall and handsome man with an engaging manner  (<span class="italic">East London Advertiser</span>, 8 Nov 1913, 5), and he was undoubtedly a popular member of parliament, although it is difficult to assess the extent to which his constituents supported his views on immigration restriction. He died suddenly on 31 October 1913 at his residence at 4 Chelsea Embankment, London. He was buried at Ightham church, Kent, on 4 November.<br>
