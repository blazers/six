<span class="headword">Neville,  Anne</span>  (1605&#150;1689), <span class="occ">abbess of Pontoise</span>, whose baptismal name was Mary, was the third daughter of Sir Henry Neville (<i>b</i>. before 1580, <i>d</i>. 1641), later Lord Abergavenny, and his first wife, Lady Mary Sackville (<i>d</i>. before 1616). Mary Vavasour, the abbess of the Benedictine convent in Brussels, said that Anne Neville had her education from her mother, described as a fervent Catholic who instructed her daughter in her own religion. Little is known of Anne Neville's life before she joined the Benedictines. She professed at the Ghent house in 1634 and subsequently was given a number of important offices including novice mistress, dean, and councillor.<br>
<br>Anne Neville's personal qualities and her family connections led the abbess, Mary Knatchbull, to take her to England to try to secure the repayment of royal debts to the convent incurred when Charles II was in exile. Anne Neville was in England with two other nuns in June 1663 and was able to use family connections at court to secure the payment of the annuity of &pound;500 that Mary Knatchbull had negotiated earlier. During her stay she spent time when she could with her family including her sister-in-law, the dowager Lady Abergavenny, and Frances Neville, described as her sister. She remained in England for four years during which time she was able to resolve some problems related to dowry payments and develop personal contacts with Catholic families.<br>
<br>On her return to the order in 1667 Anne Neville's exact future was still undecided. The abbess of the English convent in Dunkirk, where she had stopped on her way to Ghent, invited her to remain, but there was another invitation from Abbess Eugenia Poulton at the new foundation at Pontoise. With the consent of Mary Knatchbull, the superior of the order, Anne Neville went to Pontoise and after Abbess Poulton's death in December 1667 she was elected abbess by a unanimous vote. Such was her modesty that she commented on the favourable reaction to her election: &#145;Though I blush and hold this and severall things of this nature improper for me to wright&#146;  (Rumsey, 60). She explained her limited response by writing that she could find no one willing to take on the task of annalist and was herself unwilling to comment on the praise she had received.<br>
<br>Like several others at the time Pontoise was a convent with financial difficulties. The nuns had moved from Boulogne but had kept their property in the town. This had increased the borrowings needed to buy suitable premises in Pontoise. Anne Neville's &#145;Annals&#146; and her other manuscripts reveal real understanding of the problems facing superiors and a sensible pragmatic approach to finding solutions. Pontoise was a convent with friends in high places in both the English and French courts. However, this did not prevent the non-payment of dowries, the main source of income. Some significant gifts of precious items were received but while these indicated the favour with which the convent was regarded by Catholic exiles, they did not meet bills. It took some negotiating before the abbess was able, in 1669, to recover money that was still tied up in property in Boulogne, the site of the initial foundation. However, with her careful management the existence of the Pontoise house continued, although finances remained precarious.<br>
<br>As abbess Anne Neville took her responsibilities very seriously. She wrote a lengthy &#145;Instructions for superiors&#146; completed in 1676, outlining the duties and obligations of all officials in the convent for the purpose of sound management. In it she offered practical advice particularly on how the young girls entering the convent should be treated, and the importance of keeping accounts. The register of members giving details of both choir nuns and lay sisters was kept largely in her hand, with each nun having her obituary carefully recorded.<br>
<br>Abbess Anne Neville's &#145;Annals&#146;, which end abruptly in 1685, are an essential source for the history of the Benedictine communities in Flanders. She wrote for an audience, and her writing shows awareness of her role as a reporter, selecting material, drawing together information from a number of sources, and interpreting motives and actions of key figures, male and female. This can be seen strongly in her analysis of the reasons for the difficulties following the convent's foundation at Ypres in 1665. She argued that it should be treated as a time of trial; she failed to find weaknesses in the sisters who opened the new house, but concluded that in such circumstances good intentions were not enough for success. As annalist she acknowledged her sources carefully, quoting extensively from Abbess Mary Vavasour in Brussels and including a letter from Charles II in her account.<br>
<br>Pontoise remained a small house, but through her writing, her travelling, and her connections, Abbess Anne Neville extended her influence outside its walls. Her extensive writings reveal the love she had for her community, her understanding of management issues, and her qualities of leadership. In her own obituary her nuns recorded the qualities they particularly admired in her, focusing on her care for the individual, her ability to comfort and advise, giving each of them her undivided attention, as well as her religious zeal. Anne Neville died on 15 December 1689 having governed her convent for twenty-two years.<br>
