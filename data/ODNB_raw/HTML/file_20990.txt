<span class="headword">Owen,  David</span> <span class="st"> [Dafydd y Garreg Wen]</span>  (1711/12&#150;1741), <span class="occ">harper</span>, was the son of Owen Humphreys and his wife, Gwen Roberts of Isallt Fawr, Llanfihangel-y-Pennant, Caernarvonshire, a member of a family that was traditionally believed to be descended from the physicians of Myddfai. He was born at a farmhouse called Y Garreg Wen, at Ynyscynhaearn, near Porthmadog, Caernarvonshire. There he died in August 1741, and was buried in the churchyard of Ynyscynhaearn, where in 1840 a monument with a Welsh inscription and the figure of a harp was erected by subscription over his grave.<br>
<br>Owen is said to have been a competent harper. Tradition attributes to him the authorship of the well-known air which, in all Welsh collections of national songs, bears his own name of Dafydd y Garreg Wen as its title, though it is known in Scotland by the name of &#145;July Jott&#146;. Some account for this by saying that it was sent by Dafydd to a cousin of his (or, according to others, a brother named Rhys), who was then a gardener at Roslin Castle in Scotland, where the air soon became popular under a new name; but others, who accept its Scottish origin, assert that it was simply a favourite one of Dafydd's.<br>
<br>According to the Welsh tradition, Dafydd when on his deathbed had fallen in a trance and was believed to be dead, but, suddenly reviving, told his mother that he had just heard one of the sweetest songs of heaven, which, on his harp being handed him, he then played; but as the last note was dying away Dafydd, too, died. The air was subsequently preserved from memory by his mother, who was herself a harper and poet. Sir Walter Scott wrote words for the air, entitled &#145;The Dying Bard&#146;. Scott adds that the bard &#145;requested that the air might be performed at his funeral&#146;, and his instructions were carried out. At least two other airs are ascribed to Dafydd: namely, &#145;Codiad yr ehedydd&#146; (&#145;Rising of the Lark&#146;) and &#145;Difyrrwch gwyr Cricieth&#146; (&#145;The Delight of the Men of Cricieth&#146;), which is also known as &#145;Roslin Castle&#146; in Scotland, where tradition says it was popularized by Dafydd's cousin. Evan Evans (Ieuan Glan Geirionydd) wrote words (in Welsh) for this air. The tunes of &#145;Dafydd y Garreg Wen&#146; and &#145;Codiad yr ehedydd&#146; were first published in <span class="italic">Musical and Poetical Relicks of the Welsh Bards</span> (1784), by Edward Jones (Bardd y Brenin). Their English and Welsh words in Henry Brinley Richards's <span class="italic">Songs of Wales</span>  (1873, 58, 79) are by John Oxenford and J. Ceiriog Hughes respectively.<br>
