<span class="headword">Willoughby,  Leonard Ashley</span>  (1885&#150;1977), <span class="occ">German scholar</span>, was born on 4 June 1885 in Bonby, Lincolnshire, the son of William Henry Willoughby, hat manufacturer, and his wife, Fanny Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Grant. His father, who owed a great deal to the working men's institutes, was a man of great energy and intelligence, and of wide cultural and linguistic sympathies, who could recite <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> in the original, and he instilled in his son an abiding love for Goethe's drama <span class="italic">Egmont</span>. He set up his own hatter's business in the rue Castiglione, off the Place Vend&ocirc;me, in Paris (he was, apparently, particularly good at producing silk toppers). Much of that verve and breadth of interests was passed on to his son.<br>
<br>Willoughby was educated at the Lyc&eacute;e Carnot in Paris, at the Ohlig Realschule in Solingen in the German Rhineland, and at the City of London School. In 1902 he went to University College, London (where one of his most cherished memories was of buying, for sixpence, a first edition of <span class="italic">A Shropshire Lad</span> from the college's professor of Latin, who was none other than A. E. Housman). After graduating with a first in German in 1906 he continued his studies at the University of Vienna (where he worked on a medieval text concerning the last judgment, obtaining a doctorate of which he was fond of observing that it gave him a place both in this world and the next) and at the University of Bonn. After two years (1908&#150;10) at the University of Cologne as English <i>Lektor</i> he was appointed Taylorian lecturer in German at Oxford, holding that post until 1919. One of his students in those heady years was Adrian Boult. When Willoughby took his mother to one of Boult's early concerts she was, apparently, sceptical that any great future awaited him on the podium. &#145;His legs are too thin&#146;, she remarked with summary authority  (private information). Dorothy L. Sayers, another of Willoughby's students, repaid her fond memory of his teaching by agreeing to speak on &#145;Faust and the devil&#146; in 1944 to the newly revived English Goethe Society (revived by Willoughby himself). Her lecture was briefly&#151;but only briefly&#151;interrupted by a V2 rocket descending on Tottenham Court Road.<br>
<br>During the First World War Willoughby served with the Loyal North Lancashire regiment before being invalided out of active service and assigned to the naval intelligence department, with the rank of lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. After the cessation of hostilities he acted as an interpreter to the armistice commission at Kiel and the reparations commission at Versailles. The war gave Willoughby two cardinal experiences. One was the beginning, on 18 August 1916, of a long and happy marriage to Lucie Edith Berthon (<i>b</i>. 1895/6), daughter of Henry Edward Berthon, the Taylorian lecturer in French at Oxford (known affectionately to generations of Oxford students as Papa Berthon); they had one son. The other was an abiding sense of the importance of maintaining cultural links between nations, most particularly at times when politics sundered them. After the war Willoughby moved to the University of Sheffield as lecturer in charge of German (1919&#150;30), then briefly to the University of Manchester as Henry Simon professor of German and head of department (1930&#150;31), before returning to his alma mater, University College, London, to succeed his former teacher Robert Priebsch as Fielden professor and head of the German department.<br>
<br>As a scholar Willoughby had four particular achievements. The first was his editions of various important German literary texts, including Schiller's <span class="italic">Die R&auml;uber</span> (1922), Goethe's <span class="italic">Urfaust</span> and <span class="italic">Faust, ein Fragment</span> (1943), and Schiller's <span class="italic">Kabale und Liebe</span> (1945), which made him a household name with generations of sixth-formers and undergraduates. Second, he wrote monographs on two key periods of German literature&#151;<span class="italic">The Classical Age of German Literature</span> (1926) and <span class="italic">The Romantic Movement in Germany</span> (1930)&#151;which combined erudition with brevity and an essayistic lightness of touch. Third, in a splendid post-retirement burst of creativity, he collaborated with his former pupil, then colleague, and then successor to his chair, (Elizabeth) Mary Wilkinson, on a volume of essays, <span class="italic">Goethe: Poet and Thinker</span> (1962), and on a translation, bilingual edition, and annotation of Schiller's letters, <span class="italic">On the Aesthetic Education of Man</span> (1967). The latter work is beyond doubt a superlative achievement: tenaciously detailed, breathtaking in the range and breadth of its scholarship, it combines intense theoretical sophistication with almost visceral energy and passion. These qualities were also abundantly in evidence in the late volume of essays, <span class="italic">Models of Wholeness</span>, which appeared in 2002, a year after Mary Wilkinson's death. The fourth strand of Willoughby's principal achievements involved the practical, institutional life of German studies in the UK. In 1937 he founded, and until 1956 he edited, <span class="italic">German Life and Letters</span>, which, as its title indicates, was conceived as a journal concerned with a broad spectrum of intellectual enquiry into things German&#151;embracing history, philosophy, politics, and literature in an approach that later became known as cultural studies. Willoughby was concerned that the journal should offer &#145;an historical perspective, free from political bias&#146; (as he put it in an editorial note in the first number). That it swiftly achieved its aim can be gauged from the fact that when publication was interrupted in October 1939 Willoughby was able to note with great pride that the London correspondent of the official Nazi newspaper, <span class="italic">V&ouml;lkischer Beobachter</span>, had described <span class="italic">German Life and Letters</span> as a &#145;journal which no self-respecting German could read&#146;  (O. I. Bond, &#145;Foreign language films at International House&#146;, <span class="italic">Books Abroad</span>, 14/2, 1940, 215).<br>
<br>Throughout the Second World War Willoughby remained passionately concerned about events in Germany, and about the need, wherever possible, to establish lines of communication between Britain and that country and to work towards the reintegration of the valuable things about Germany and its culture into English life after the war. Against all the odds in 1943 he received the support of his colleagues in German, and miraculously, not long thereafter, persuaded London University at large to back his plan for a research centre in German studies in London. Thus the Institute of Germanic Studies came into being, and when it opened in 1950 Willoughby, rightly, was its first honorary director. That public achievement also had a personal aspect. In March 1939 Willoughby had managed to bring to England his student friend Robert Pick, who had survived incarceration in Dachau, and Pick became the first librarian of the Institute of Germanic Studies.<br>
<br>In recognition of his services to German culture Willoughby was the first English scholar to be elected to the German Academy for Language and Literature, and he was the first English scholar to receive the gold medal of Germany's Goethe Institute. He was (at various times, and sometimes they were quite lengthy times) president of the English Goethe Society, the Modern Language Association of Great Britain, and the Modern Humanities Research Association. Such honours, though welcome, were not looked for. Willoughby was a supremely modest man&#151;delightful, urbane, and civilized. He was renowned for his ability to chair meetings deftly and to deliver after-dinner speeches in English, French, or German&#151;with the same wit and flair in evidence in all three languages.<br>
<br>Willoughby lived, throughout his time at London University, in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, latterly at Angle Place Cottage, Montague Road. His last days were spent at University College Hospital, from which, to his intense delight, he could glimpse the portico of the beloved college that had been his spiritual home for over sixty years. He died on 5 October 1977, of bronchopneumonia and a perforated duodenal ulcer. He was survived by his wife, Lucie.<br>
