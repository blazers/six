<span class="headword">Williams,  Peter</span>  (1723&#150;1796), <span class="occ">biblical commentator</span>, was born on 7 January 1723 at West Marsh, near Laugharne, Carmarthenshire, the son of Owen William (1694&#150;1735), farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth Bayly (<i>d</i>. 1733). Peter had an older sister, Hester (1720&#150;1764), and a younger brother, David, born in 1725. In 1741 he became a pupil at the prestigious Carmarthen grammar school, which provided him with a firm grounding in the classics. On 14 April 1743 he went to hear George Whitefield preaching at Carmarthen, and his sermon, on <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> 54: 5, brought about his evangelical conversion. He left school in 1743 or 1744 and became a schoolmaster himself at nearby Cynwyl Elfed, where he prepared himself for holy orders. He was granted a title by John Evans (1702&#150;1782), the incumbent of Eglwys Gymyn, and after his ordination as deacon by John Gilbert, the bishop of St David's, he was licensed as curate in the parish. Williams's Methodism soon brought him into conflict with Evans and he was dismissed, and the same happened in his two subsequent curacies at Swansea and Llangrannog, Cardiganshire.<br>
<br>On 7 January 1747 Williams was formally received into the ranks of the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists. His preaching journeys in 1747 and 1748 took him to Anglesey and Denbighshire. He suffered much petty persecution, and his preaching at Adwy'r-clawdd, in Denbighshire, provoked Sir Watkin Williams Wynn (1692&#150;1749) to issue a warrant on 3 January 1748 summoning Williams and some of his auditors to be examined by him in his capacity as a magistrate. He fined Williams &pound;20 and the others 5<i>s</i>. apiece. But, when appeal was made to the courts, Sir Watkin was found to have acted illegally and was ordered to refund the fines and pay the costs.<br>
<br>On 3 August 1748 at Llanarthne parish church Williams married Mary (1726&#150;1822), the daughter of John Jenkins, a small landowner of Gors in that parish. They had six children, the eldest of whom was the genealogist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29502/', "Eliezer Williams")</script>. Williams and his wife lived first at a farm called Moelfre, near Carmarthen, but their landlady was so opposed to their Methodism that she terminated the lease within a year, and afterwards they bought Gelli Lednais, a farm in the parish of Llandyfaelog, and spent the rest of their lives there.<br>
<br>About 1759 it occurred to Williams to utilize the press as an instrument for evangelical work, and he thereafter became the chief contributor to the religious literature of Wales during the eighteenth century. His greatest undertaking was the publication at his own risk of a family edition of the Welsh <span class="roman">Bible</span> with annotations of his own at the end of each chapter, this being the first Welsh commentary on the whole <span class="roman">Bible</span> ever issued. This was also the first time that a <span class="roman">Bible</span> was printed in Wales. The work was issued in shilling parts, the first appearing in 1767. The &#145;<span class="roman">Beibl Peter Williams</span>&#146; proved to be greatly popular in Wales, and many thousands of copies were issued. The whole work appeared in volume form in 1770.<br>
<br>In May 1770, when the final part of Williams's <span class="roman">Bible</span> was published by John Ross (1729?&#150;1807) at Carmarthen, there was some immediate criticism. The comments on <span class="roman">John</span> 1 raised misgivings because Williams, by writing such words as &#145;the Man Jesus is the everlasting Father&#146;, seemed to suggest that he was &#145;confounding the Persons&#146; of the Trinity and so departing from the Athanasian creed. His close friend Daniel Rowland (1711?&#150;1790) had drawn his attention to this possibility, but no changes were introduced in the second edition of 1779&#150;81. About September 1786 David Jones (1741&#150;1792) asked Peter Williams to assist him by editing a Welsh version of John Canne's pocket <span class="roman">Bible</span>. That was printed at Trefeca and published jointly by Williams and Jones in 1790. Immediately trouble arose. The leading critic was Nathaniel Rowland (1749&#150;1831), the son of Daniel Rowland. Williams was accused of changing the wording of two verses in order to support his alleged heretical doctrine of the Trinity. At the South Wales Association in Llandeilo, on 25 May 1791, Williams was excommunicated and prohibited from selling this new <span class="roman">Bible</span> among the Methodists. The condemnation was endorsed by the North Wales Association at Bala on 8 June. It was a poignant end to Williams's splendid contribution to the development of Welsh Calvinistic Methodism. But this did not affect the popularity of his 1770 <span class="roman">Bible</span>. By 1877 it had been published in thirty-four editions. Williams made several attempts to persuade the Methodists to receive him back into their ranks but to no avail.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Williams had been devoted to literary work. Apart from the <span class="roman">Bibles</span> he edited, he published thirty-three other titles in all. These productions are of historical rather than literary or theological interest. His English-language <span class="italic">Hymns on Various Subjects</span> (1771) included his translation of William Williams's &#145;Nerth i fyned trwy'r anialwch&#146;, now beginning &#145;Guide me, O thou great Jehovah&#146;; his first verse was retained when William Williams produced his own English version, which in the twentieth century, set to John Hughes's &#145;Cwm Rhondda&#146;, became one of the most familiar Methodist hymns. He preached his last sermon at Llanlluan on 24 July 1796, but he was very weak and dictated his will on 1 August. He was suffering from asthma and a failing heart and died at his home, Gelli Lednais, on 8 August 1796, aged seventy-three, and was buried at Llandyfaelog churchyard. His wife, Mary, died at Gelli Lednais on 8 March 1822 and was buried with her him.<br>
<br>Williams was a man of strong character. He was an attractive and, at times, a powerful preacher. No other Methodist leader suffered more persecution than he did. A lack of clarity in his thinking still makes it difficult to ascertain the precise nature of the heresy for which he was excommunicated. But of his large contribution to Welsh Methodism there can be no doubt.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_29536"></a><span class="headword">Peter Bailey Williams</span>  (1763&#150;1836), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, the fifth child and second son of Peter Williams and his wife, Mary, was born at Gelli Lednais, Llandyfaelog. He was baptized on 2 August 1763. He was educated at Carmarthen grammar school and Jesus College, Oxford, and graduated BA from Christ Church in 1790. He was ordained deacon in February 1788 by the bishop of Gloucester and licensed to the curacy of Eastleach Martin in Gloucestershire. The following November he was ordained priest. After a short curacy at Swinbrook, Oxfordshire, he moved early in 1790 to a curacy in Burford, and remained there until on 13 July 1792 he became rector of Llanrug and Llanberis, Caernarvonshire, where he stayed until his death. On 24 August 1815 he was also granted the perpetual curacy of Betws Garmon, Caernarvonshire.<br>
<br>In September 1804 Williams married Hannah, the daughter of Henry Jones of Llanrwst. They had one son, Henry Bayley Williams (1805&#150;1879), rector of Llanberis (1836&#150;43) and Llanrug (1843&#150;79). Hannah Williams died on 11 January 1835, aged sixty-four, and was buried at Llanrug. Williams, in November 1835, married as his second wife Mrs Charlotte Hands of Shrewsbury. They had no children. She died on 8 September 1849, aged seventy-four, and was also buried at Llanrug.<br>
<br>Williams's interests were mainly literary, and he contributed to contemporary journals and patronized promising young writers. Although he was an assiduous copier of the works of medieval poets and a collector of historical minutiae, he can hardly be described as a competent antiquarian. He did, however, provide Nicholas Carlisle (1771&#150;1847), the secretary of the Society of Antiquaries, with some information for his <span class="italic">Topographical Dictionary of the Dominion of Wales</span>, and gave similar assistance to William Cathrall when he was writing his <span class="italic">History of North Wales</span> (1828). His own antiquarian interest is shown in his contribution to <span class="italic">The Tourist's Guide to the County of Carnarvon</span> (1821). He was a keen supporter of education, and the Sunday school which he opened at Llanrug in 1793 was the first in the county. He was a conservative in politics and opposed vigorously those who supported the French Revolution. He took a prominent part in local life, and was a magistrate and deputy lieutenant for the county. Williams died on 22 November 1836 and was buried at Llanrug churchyard.<br>
<br>Another <a name="cosubject_29535"></a><span class="headword">Peter Williams</span>  (1756?&#150;1837), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of Edward Williams of Northop and Oakenholt, Flintshire, and his wife, Ann. He matriculated on 23 May 1776, aged nineteen, from Christ Church, Oxford, and graduated BA in 1780, MA in 1783, and BD and DD in 1802. From 1789 to 1803 he was chaplain of Christ Church and on 4 May 1790 became vicar of Bangor. On 22 November 1794 he was appointed headmaster of Friars' School, Bangor. He was rector of Llanbedrog, Caernarvonshire, from 1802 to 1837, archdeacon of Merioneth from 27 October 1802 until 1809, canon of Bangor from 1 July 1809 to 1818, and was appointed vicar of Llanrhaeadr, Denbighshire, on 21 November 1818, where he remained until his resignation in 1820. He married Mary, the daughter of John Roberts, archdeacon of Merioneth, who died on 7 August 1802, aged seventy-three. Mary died on 30 July 1826, aged fifty-eight.<br>
<br>Peter Williams was a vigorous critic of Methodism, as is revealed in his book <span class="italic">A Short Vindication of the Established Church</span> (1803). He also published volumes of sermons in both Welsh and English as well as a translation into blank verse of part of Homer's <span class="italic">Iliad</span> (1806). He died at Llanbedrog on 20 February 1837, aged eighty. Both he and his wife were buried at Llanbedrog.<br>
