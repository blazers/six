<span class="headword">Perowne,  John James Stewart</span>  (1823&#150;1904), <span class="occ">bishop of Worcester</span>, born at Durdawan, Bengal, on 13 March 1823, was the eldest of the three sons of the Revd John Perowne, a missionary of the Church Missionary Society, and his wife, Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Scott, of Heacham, Norfolk. His brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35482/', "Edward Henry Perowne")</script>, master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and Thomas Thomason Perowne, archdeacon of Norwich from 1878 to 1910. The family was of Huguenot origin. Educated first by his father, and subsequently at Norwich grammar school, Perowne won a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. He was Bell university scholar in 1842; members' prizeman in 1844, 1846, and 1847; Crosse scholar in 1845; and Tyrwhitt scholar in 1848. He graduated BA in 1845, and proceeded MA in 1848, BD in 1856, and DD in 1873. In 1845 he became assistant master at Cheam School; he was ordained deacon in 1847 and priest in 1848; and he served the curacy of Tunstead, Norfolk, from 1847 to 1849. In 1849 he became a master at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and was elected to a fellowship at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>For a time Perowne served his college as assistant tutor, while also lecturing at King's College, London, acting as assistant preacher at Lincoln's Inn, and carrying out duties as examining chaplain to the bishop of Norwich. He examined for the classical tripos in 1851 and 1852, and was select preacher in 1853, an office he also filled in 1861, 1873, 1876, 1879, 1882, and 1897.<br>
<br>In 1862 following his marriage to Anna Maria Woolryche, daughter of Humphrey William Woolryche, Perowne moved to Wales. He was vice-principal of St David's College, Lampeter (1862&#150;72); cursal prebendary of St David's (1867&#150;72); canon of Llandaff (1869&#150;78); and rector of Llandisilio, Montgomeryshire (1870&#150;71). He became strongly influenced by the broad-churchman Connop Thirlwall, during his time at St David's, Lampeter.<br>
<br>Perowne's name as an <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> scholar was made by his two-volume commentary on, and translation of, the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>, published in 1864. In 1870 he was chosen one of the Old Testament Revision Company. In 1868 he had become Hulsean lecturer, and in 1872 he returned to Cambridge. From 1873 to 1875 he held a fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge, and he was Lady Margaret preacher in 1874, and Whitehall preacher from 1874 to 1876. In 1875 he succeeded Joseph Barber Lightfoot as Hulsean professor, and he held office until 1878. For the same period (1875&#150;8) he was one of the honorary chaplains to Queen Victoria, who was said to have commented that Bishop Perowne had the best legs of any prelate on the episcopal bench.<br>
<br>In 1878 Perowne was appointed dean of Peterborough. He developed the cathedral services, carried on the restoration of the fabric, and cultivated friendly relations with nonconformists. In 1881 he was appointed to the ecclesiastical courts commission, and he was one of seven commissioners who signed a protest against the exercise by the bishop of an absolute veto on proceedings. In 1889 he aided in founding a body known as Churchmen in Council, which aimed at uniting &#145;moderate&#146; churchmen in a policy regarding ritual; he explained the aim of the society by issuing in the same year a proposal for authorizing both the maximum and the minimum interpretation of the &#145;ornaments rubric&#146;, which was widely discussed but led to no results.<br>
<br>Having turned down the bishopric of Bangor in 1889, Perowne accepted the see of Worcester and was consecrated bishop in Westminster Abbey on 2 February 1891. He obtained the appointment of a suffragan bishop, created a new archdeaconry, and summoned a diocesan conference. In 1892 and for several years following, he presided at some sessions of an informal conference on ecclesiastical reunion of nonconformists and Anglicans held at Grindelwald in Switzerland. Following a fire at the English church, Perowne celebrated communion in the Zwinglian chapel at Grindelwald and administered the sacrament to leading nonconformists at the conference. His action led to widespread censure by the high-church press. The church congress, hitherto excluded from the diocese, met at Birmingham in 1893, when the bishop announced his assent to the division of his diocese and his willingness to contribute &pound;500 a year to the stipend of the new see from the income of Worcester. This was afterwards made contingent on his being allowed to give up Hartlebury Castle, to which the ecclesiastical commissioners refused consent. Attacked in the Birmingham press for his action in the matter in 1896, Perowne was presented with an address of approval by sixty beneficed clergy of three rural deaneries. He resigned the see in 1901, and retired to Southwick Park, near Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire, where he died on 6 November 1904. He was buried at Hartlebury churchyard. The Worcester diocese was divided under Perowne's successor and the see of Birmingham was founded in 1905. Perowne's wife, four sons, and one daughter all survived him.<br>
<br>Perowne's ecclesiastical position is not easily categorized. Although a lifelong evangelical, he took independent views of biblical criticism, home reunion, and proposals for meeting ritual difficulties. His theological writings, his dislike of sect and party within church matters, and the influence of the broad-churchman Connop Thirlwall suggest that he was closer to the broad-church position than the evangelical one. As a bishop he accepted a difficult see late in life, but showed himself an industrious, capable administrator willing to make courageous and unpopular decisions where necessary. A portrait of the bishop by the Hon. John Collier was given to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and another, by Henry Weigall, to Hartlebury Castle. Perowne's primary work remained his translation of and commentary on the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>, of which a sixth edition appeared in 1886. He produced several other articles and short books on the interpretation of the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New</span> testaments, upholding the findings of biblical criticism. His 1868 Hulsean lectures on immortality were published in 1869.<br>
<br>As general editor of the Cambridge <span class="roman">Bible for Schools</span> (1877&#150;) he was able to influence the degree to which the results of contemporary biblical scholarship were presented to Cambridge ordinands. He also edited Thomas Rogers in <span class="italic">Catholic Doctrine of the Church of England</span> (1854); <span class="italic">Remains of Connop Thirlwall, Bishop of St David's</span> (1877); <span class="italic">The Letters, Literary and Theological, of Connop Thirlwall</span> (1881); and <span class="italic">The Cambridge Greek Testament for Schools</span> (1881).<br>
