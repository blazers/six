<span class="headword">Perkins, Sir  Aeneas</span>  (1834&#150;1901), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at Lewisham, Kent, on 19 May 1834, was the sixth son in a family of thirteen children of Charles Perkins, merchant, of London, and his wife, Jane Homby, daughter of Charles William Barkley (<i>b</i>. 1759), after whom Barkley Sound and Island in the Pacific are named. His grandfather was John Perkins of Camberwell, a partner in Barclay and Perkins's brewery. A brother George, in the Bengal artillery, was killed at the battle of the Hindan before Delhi in 1857. Perkins was educated at Dr Prendergast's school at Lewisham and at Stoton and Mayor's school at Wimbledon, where Frederick Roberts, his lifelong friend, was his schoolfellow. He entered Addiscombe College on 1 February 1850, at the same time as Roberts. Perkins showed ability in mathematics, and was a leader in all sports. Commissioned second lieutenant, Bengal Engineers, on 12 December 1851, he, after professional instruction at Chatham, arrived at Fort William, Calcutta, on 16 January 1854.<br>
<br>As assistant engineer in the public works department Perkins was soon employed on irrigation work on the Bari Doab Canal in the Punjab. Promoted first lieutenant on 17 August 1856, he was transferred in November to the Ambala division, and in the following May, when the Indian mutiny began, joined the force under General George Anson, commander-in-chief in India, which marched to the relief of Delhi. Perkins was present at the battle of Badli-ki-sarai on 8 June, and at the seizure of the Delhi Ridge. He did much good work during the early part of the siege. On 11&#150;12 June he was employed in the construction of a mortar battery&#151;known as &#145;Perkins's battery&#146;. On 17 June he took part in the destruction of a rebel battery and the capture of its guns, and on 14 July in the repulse of the sortie. He was wounded a few days later near the walls of Delhi, and sent to Ambala. Although he soon recovered from the wound, he was forced by broken health to remain there until March 1858, when he was invalided home.<br>
<br>After returning to India in 1859 Perkins held various offices in Bengal, including those of assistant principal of the Civil Engineering College at Calcutta, assistant consulting engineer for the railways, and executive engineer of the Berhampore division. On 12 March 1862 he was promoted second captain. He married in 1863 Janette Wilhelmina (who survived him), daughter of Werner Cathray, formerly 13th light dragoons, and they had two sons&#151;Major Arthur Ernest John Perkins, and Major Aeneas Charles Perkins, 40th Pathans&#151;and three daughters.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1864 Perkins took part as field engineer in the Bhutan expedition, during which he was three times mentioned in dispatches for gallant conduct, and was recommended for a brevet majority. Towards the end of the expedition he was appointed chief engineer of the force. A Victoria Cross recommendation for gallantry in storming a stockade at the summit of the Baru Pass was rejected as too late. For his services in Bhutan, he received a brevet majority on 30 June 1865.<br>
<br>Perkins was executive engineer at Murshidabad, and from 1866 in the Darjeeling division. Promoted first captain in his corps on 31 October 1868, two years later he was sent to the North-Western Provinces as superintending engineer, and in April 1872 he was transferred in the same grade to the military works branch. He became regimental major on 5 July 1872, brevet lieutenant-colonel on 29 December 1874, and regimental lieutenant-colonel on 1 October 1877.<br>
<br>A year later, at Roberts's request, Perkins was selected for active service in Afghanistan, and was appointed commanding royal engineer of Roberts's Kurram field force. During the operations in front of the Paiwar Pass he skilfully reconnoitred the enemy's position, and selected a site from which the mountain battery could shell the Afghan camp. The works carried on under his orders in the Kurram valley greatly facilitated the subsequent advance on Kabul. He was mentioned in dispatches, and was made a CB in 1879. On the conclusion of peace with Sirdar Yakub Khan, Perkins remained in the Kurram valley, laying out a cantonment at Shalofzan, but on the news of the massacre of Sir Louis Cavagnari and his escort at Kabul an immediate advance was made by the Kurram column, and Perkins was present at the victory of Charasia on 6 October, and at the entry into Kabul (8 October 1879), and was mentioned in dispatches. The engineers' work was then very heavy. At Kabul the Sherpur cantonment and Bala Hissar had to be repaired, and a new line of communication with India via Jalalabad had to be opened out. The Sherpur cantonment was rendered defensible by the beginning of December, just in time. A few days later the Afghans assembled in such overwhelming numbers that Roberts had to concentrate his entire force within the walls of Sherpur. Under Perkins's direction emplacements and abatis were rapidly constructed, blockhouses were built on the Bemaru heights, walls and villages dangerously near the cantonment were blown up and levelled, and a second line of defence within the enclosure was improvised. On 23 December the enemy attacked in great numbers. They were repulsed, and dispersed by a counter-attack. Perkins was mentioned in dispatches and promoted brevet colonel on 29 December 1879.<br>
<br>Perkins attempted to make the position at Kabul secure. A fort and blockhouse were erected on the Siah Sang Ridge, the Bala Hissar and the Asmai heights were fortified, Sherpur was converted into a strongly entrenched camp, bridges were built across the Kabul River, the main roads were made passable for artillery, and many new roads were constructed. The works completed during the next seven months, mostly by unskilled Afghan labour, comprised ten forts, fifteen detached posts, three large and several small bridges, 4000 yards of loopholed parapet, 45 miles of road, and quarters for 8000 men. At the end of July 1880 the news of the Maiwand disaster reached Kabul. Perkins accompanied Roberts as commanding royal engineer with the force of 10,000 men in the famous march to Kandahar, and was at the battle of Kandahar on 1 September 1880. Soon afterwards he returned to India, and was made an aide-de-camp to the queen.<br>
<br>Perkins rejoined the military works department, was appointed superintending engineer at Rawalpindi, and from April to July 1881 officiated as inspector-general of military works. After two years' furlough he was appointed chief engineer of the Central Provinces, was transferred in the same capacity in April 1886 to the Punjab, and on 10 March 1887 was promoted major-general. In May 1889, on reaching fifty-five, he vacated his military works appointment, and in 1890 was selected by Roberts, then commander-in-chief in India, to command the Oudh division, but this command was cut short by his promotion to lieutenant-general on 1 April 1891, and he returned to England. He was promoted general on 1 April 1895, made a colonel commandant, Royal Engineers, on the same date, and in 1897 was made KCB. He died at his home, 1 Bolton Street, Piccadilly, London, on 22 December 1901, and was buried at Brookwood cemetery, near Woking, Surrey. Roberts considered him &#145;an unusually intelligent, energetic gallant officer with considerable experience of war&#146;  (<span class="italic">Roberts in India</span>, 69) and publicly praised him as &#145;talented and indefatigable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Forty-one Years</span>, 373). However, Charles Metcalfe MacGregor described him as &#145;about the worst tempered fellow I know&#146;, and when he left the Oudh division it was described as &#145;the third relief of Lucknow&#146;  (Robson, 428).<br>
