<span class="headword">Whitbread,  Samuel</span>  (1764&#150;1815), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 18 January 1764 at Cardington, Bedfordshire, the only son and third child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39057/', "Samuel Whitbread (1720&#150;1796)")</script>, brewer and politician, and his first wife, Harriet, daughter of William Hayton, attorney, of Ivinghoe, Buckinghamshire. She died three months later, and Whitbread senior took as his second wife in 1769 Lady Mary Cornwallis, daughter of Charles, first Earl Cornwallis. She died the following year, after giving birth to a daughter, Mary [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59230/', "Grey, Mary (1770&#150;1858)")</script>].<h2>
<a name="Abackgroundinbrewing"></a>A background in brewing</h2>The Whitbreads were minor Bedfordshire gentry by the mid-seventeenth century. Samuel Whitbread senior, a youngest son, was apprenticed into the London brewing trade in 1736. He subsequently went into business on his own account, and at Chiswell Street developed the largest and most technically advanced porter brewery in the country. By 1790 his capital in it was over &pound;271,000. He invested heavily in landed property in Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, and six other counties. By the end of his life he owned 12,300 acres, of which 10,500 were in Bedfordshire, where he ranked second in acreage only to the dukes of Bedford. The former Torrington estates at Southill, bought in 1795, later became the family home. He was MP for Bedford on his own interest during 1768&#150;74 and 1775&#150;90. A forbidding, deeply devout man, who had abandoned the family's dissenting tradition for Anglicanism, he was a staunch supporter of Pitt.<h2>
<a name="Educationmarriageandearlypoliticalcareer"></a>Education, marriage, and early political career</h2>The younger Whitbread's upbringing was largely joyless, and great care was lavished on his education by his well-meaning but overbearing father. At Eton College from 1775, he was befriended there by Charles Grey and William Henry Lambton, youthful disciples of Fox. He entered Christ Church, Oxford, in 1780, but was removed to St John's College, Cambridge, where he resumed his acquaintance with Grey and Lambton, in 1782. He graduated BA in 1785. On his return from a European tour in 1786 he was introduced by Grey to the salons of high whig society. He fell in love with Grey's sister Elizabeth, but his father initially vetoed a marriage and sent him abroad again in the summer of 1787 for a period of reflection. After a surly penance he got his way, marrying Elizabeth Grey on 26 January 1788.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1790 Whitbread, after thinking better of an attempt on the county (which proved a step too far for the family until 1892), exploited his father's indecision and supplanted him at Bedford, where he was secure for his lifetime. His father, shocked and hurt, found a berth at Steyning in 1792, when his son was already established as one of the leading figures of the Foxite whig opposition in the Commons. Whitbread, who joined Brooks's in 1791 and the Whig Club in 1793, did well in the Ochakov debates of April and June 1791, and particularly distinguished himself on the same subject on 29 February 1792. He supported abolition of the slave trade and religious toleration, causes that he warmly espoused throughout his life. A leading spirit, with Grey, of the Society of the Friends of the People, on 25 May 1792 he advocated parliamentary reform. He supported Fox's calls for peace negotiations in December, and condemned the outbreak of war, on 1 February 1793. For the rest of that parliament he used his powerful if crude oratory to denounce allied war aims and attack coercive legislation. Although his rather superficial measure of 1796 to empower magistrates to fix a minimum wage was unsuccessful, it revealed the humanitarianism in which his liberalism was rooted, and which set him above many of his political associates.<h2>
<a name="Brewingandwealth"></a>Brewing and wealth</h2>On the death of his millionaire father in 1796 Whitbread inherited the brewery, some London property, and estates in seven counties. He later consolidated and increased his Bedfordshire estates to about 12,000 acres and sold most of the outlying lands. He carried on the brewery business alone for two years, but took in three partners in 1798 and three more in 1800: by these arrangements he was freed from the necessity of personal attendance, while remaining individually responsible for the brewery's finances. His net income from land (about &pound;12,600 a year) almost always exceeded brewery profits (about &pound;8000), but the business offered a far more lucrative return on capital. This alone probably explains why he never succumbed to strong political and social pressures to dispose of it. It was, however, a potentially unstable element in his wealth, which forced him into extensive borrowing and was a source of worry, especially from about 1808, when his finances evidently began to run into difficulties.<h2>
<a name="Anuncertainpoliticalcareer"></a>An uncertain political career</h2>Whitbread, who supported parliamentary reform in May 1797, participated in the Foxite secession. After resuming regular attendance in 1801, he acted with the Foxite opposition to Addington, but abstained from the division on the peace settlement on 14 May 1802. He supported Grey's protest against the renewal of war on 24 May 1803, and was active in the combined attack on Addington in 1804, when Fox named him, Grey, and Lord Lauderdale as his most effective political allies. Whitbread took the centre of the national political stage in 1805 with his remorseless attempt to bring Lord Melville to justice for alleged financial malpractice during his tenure of the treasurership of the navy in Pitt's first administration. Although he made some tactical blunders during the parliamentary campaign, which ended in a vote to impeach Melville on 25 June 1805, Whitbread gained much credit for the tenacity with which he conducted it. Its initial success helped to stimulate a revival of radicalism in the country, as well as fatally weakening Pitt's feeble second ministry. Whitbread regarded it as a considerable personal triumph, though Melville's acquittal in June 1806 and the ridicule excited by lapses of taste and judgement in his own concluding speech of 16 May detracted from it.<br>
<br>Whitbread's failure to secure office when the Foxites came to power in Lord Grenville's coalition ministry early in 1806 marked the turning point of his political career. The sketchy evidence suggests that his inferiority complex over his origins and involvement in trade, which made him fear rejection by the aristocratic order represented by Fox and Grey, prevented him from staking a forthright claim in his preliminary discussions with them. Grey, who never understood Whitbread and was an inveterate snob, appears to have taken literally his diffident observation that he did not wish to be considered if his inclusion would create problems. Fox, greatly harassed by the many claims pressing on him, was not disposed to quibble. In any case, Whitbread, in considering himself entitled, as it emerged, to office of cabinet or, at least, important departmental rank, overrated his pretensions. When the intensity of his mortification became clear, Grey&#151;whose earlier throwaway remark that he might sell the brewery, ownership of which disqualified him from the exchequer, had rankled&#151;sought to propitiate him. Whitbread now claimed the offer of the first suitable vacancy. In the reshuffle following Fox's death in September 1806 Grey, with Grenville's approval, offered him the secretaryship at war as soon as the incumbent, Richard Fitzpatrick, Fox's oldest political crony, could be accommodated elsewhere. He convinced Whitbread of the folly of his initial peevish rejection of the proposal because it did not entail cabinet rank; but he further soured their relationship by doing nothing to accelerate Fitzpatrick's removal and by trying to fob off the impatient Whitbread with a peerage, which he indignantly refused. Nothing had been done when the ministry fell in March 1807.<br>
<br>By then Whitbread had put himself at odds with Grey and the other whig leaders on an important political issue, by pointedly opposing on 5 January 1807 the address on the ministry's abortive peace negotiations of the summer, which he denounced as inflexible and unimaginative. In thus revealing himself as an irresponsible extremist and potential political liability, he not only annoyed Grey but also alarmed Grenville and the conservatives. His scheme for reform of the poor laws, which he outlined on 19 February 1807, fell foul of fanatics of various persuasions. He subsequently embodied its most radical proposal, for the establishment of a national system of education, in a separate bill, which, after being amended to make it optional, passed the Commons but was rejected by the Lords.<br>
<br>Whitbread had no realistic claim to the opposition leadership in the Commons when Grey succeeded to the peerage late in 1807. While Grey, who had long been grooming his wife's uncle George Ponsonby for the position, could not be criticized for passing Whitbread over, he was at fault in failing to try to reach a clear understanding with him. His pathetic attempt to mollify his brother-in-law at second hand through George Tierney, who was shocked by his discovery of the intensity of Whitbread's bitterness and resentment, made matters worse. Whitbread, who believed sincerely, if fatuously, in the feasibility of a negotiated peace, lost his temper with Grey on the subject in Grenville's company in January 1808, and soon afterwards gave notice of three resolutions calling for negotiations. A subterfuge initiated by Lauderdale seemed to have succeeded in persuading him to accept a more moderate address; but at the party meeting on the eve of the debate Ponsonby lost control of the warmongers, whose hostility prompted Whitbread to revert to his own resolutions. On 29 February 1808 Ponsonby moved the previous question on the third and last of these, which was lost by 211 votes to 58.<h2>
<a name="Erraticextremisminpolitics"></a>Erratic extremism in politics</h2>Although Whitbread was now irrevocably set on a course of erratic extremism, he and the whigs did not actually part company until 1812. He established himself as the most frequent and powerful speaker on the opposition side. His enthusiasm for the Spanish cause was short-lived and, although he was talked out of moving an amendment to the address in 1809, he criticized British involvement in the Peninsula on 19 January, and on 31 January went out on a limb by proposing a peace amendment on the address on the Erfurt overtures. Increasingly influenced and flattered by Thomas Creevey, he enthusiastically took up the cause of economical reform, setting a lead and example for the radical whigs of the &#145;Mountain&#146;, who were seeking to encourage the revival of radicalism inspired by the acquittal of the duke of York on charges of involvement in the corrupt disposal of army patronage in March 1809. Whitbread's call at the Westminster meeting of 29 March for a national campaign for parliamentary reform further shocked the party hierarchy. Yet his relations with the extra-parliamentary reform movement were uneasy: he was never entirely trusted by its leaders, and, indeed, was not prepared to go to their extremes. He did, however, help to perpetuate and sustain the Foxite reforming tradition in unpropitious times.<br>
<br>Attempts by the whig leaders, scenting office, to re-establish a practical relationship with Whitbread in the winter of 1809&#150;10, when Grey again left the dirty work largely to Tierney, failed in so far as he refused to acknowledge Ponsonby's titular leadership. At the same time, he was personally amiable towards Grey and Grenville, and not inclined to be provocative. The 1810 session passed without an open breach, though he showed considerable independence. His bid on 25 January to commit the house to economical reform was defeated by 95 votes to 54. He was included in opposition discussions of their plans for the attack on the Scheldt fiasco, and took a leading and effective part in the debates on it. His guarded support for Burdett in his conflict with parliament, and his advocacy of reform agitation at the London livery dinner on 19 April 1810, earned him a written rebuke from Grenville, but he was politely unrepentant.<br>
<br>Had the whigs come to power on the establishment of the Regency in February 1811, Whitbread, whose ambition for office was still strong, would have become first lord of the Admiralty. Grey and Lord Holland overcame Grenville's resistance but, characteristically, Whitbread himself almost wrecked the arrangement by raising objections to serving under Grenville if he retained his auditorship of the exchequer. He was eventually mollified by Grenville's grudging agreement to forgo the salary, but it was the regent who finally dashed his hopes. He was less active than recently in the 1811 session, when he refused to countenance Cartwright's plan for an alliance between whig reformers and radicals. In 1812 Whitbread went increasingly his own way, and put himself beyond the pale as far as the opposition leaders were concerned. His call on 7 January for peace with and exoneration of Napoleon set the tone, while his motion for information on deteriorating relations with America, on 13 February, secured only twenty-three votes. In May 1812 Grenville, though acknowledging that Whitbread had acted without personal malice in supporting Creevey's attack on the sinecure tellership of the exchequer held by his brother the marquess of Buckingham, renounced all future political co-operation with him. Grey's was the only dissenting voice when the whig hierarchy excluded Whitbread from consideration for office in the early negotiations for a new administration following Perceval's assassination. Whitbread's ambition and poor judgement betrayed him into supporting Lord Moira's abortive and half-hearted scheme to set up a reforming government. His wild denunciation of Grey and Grenville for insisting on changing the household, which he blamed for its failure, caused great offence.<h2>
<a name="Apoliticaloutcast"></a>A political outcast</h2>For the rest of his life Whitbread was an outcast from the main body of opposition. He kept up his obsessive demands for peace negotiations and sought, to a limited extent, to promote economic and parliamentary reform. His involvement in 1813 in the campaign on behalf of the princess of Wales, in which he acted as Henry Brougham's lieutenant, was a waste of his talents. After early successes he made a mistake by accusing the commissioners of the inquiry of 1806, Grenville and lords Spencer, Erskine, and Ellenborough, of deliberately misrepresenting evidence. His churlish withdrawal of the charge did him little good. He renewed his efforts in Caroline's cause in 1814, but only succeeded in playing into the hands of ministers and exasperating Brougham. Desperate for peace, he expressed confidence on 20 December 1813 in the ministry's wish to effect it. On 29 June 1814 he concurred in the address on the treaty of Paris and praised Lord Castlereagh, but objected to the notion that the end of the war justified the way in which it had been waged.<br>
<br>On 8 November 1814 Whitbread attacked the government over the war with America. In the following months, when the barely controlled vehemence of his parliamentary speeches raised eyebrows, he voiced his concern at the repression of liberalism in Europe. In March 1815 he protested against a renewal of hostilities, and on 7 April he got thirty-seven votes for an amendment deploring war for the purpose of determining who should rule France. His address of protest on 28 April against a war to destroy Napoleon was rejected by 273 votes to 72. There was a strain of hysteria in many of Whitbread's pronouncements on the situation in Europe, though he denied being an unreserved apologist for the French emperor.<h2>
<a name="Declineandsuicide"></a>Decline and suicide</h2>The decline in Whitbread's health, noticeable for about six years and marked by excessive increase in weight and susceptibility to debilitating headaches, accelerated in June 1815. Worn out, but unable to sleep, he oscillated between extremes of agitation and despair. On receipt of the news of Waterloo and Napoleon's abdication, he caused surprise on 23 June by praising the duke of Wellington and the ministry, albeit in qualified terms. His last speech in the house, on 4 July, was on a motion thanking the duke of York for his work as commander-in-chief, in which, after a brief show of his old defiance, he tamely acquiesced. He spent the evening of the following day in frenzied talks with his attorney on the tangled finances of the Drury Lane Theatre, which had taken up much of his time since he had become chairman of the committee to promote its rebuilding after the fire of 1809. On the morning of 6 July 1815 he killed himself by cutting his throat at his London house at 35 Dover Street, Piccadilly.<br>
<br>The evidence strongly suggests that the mental disturbance prevailing when Whitbread committed suicide had its basis in an organic disorder, possibly Cushing's syndrome, a disease of the endocrine glands. It is idle to speculate whether he was driven to the final act by worry and guilt over the problems of the theatre, or by a paranoiac belief that the defeat of Napoleon symbolized his own political failure. With his wife, who died on 28 November 1848, he had two sons and two daughters: William Henry (1795&#150;1867), MP for Bedford 1818&#150;34; Samuel Charles (1796&#150;1879), MP for Middlesex 1820&#150;30; Elizabeth (1791&#150;1843), who married William, eighth Earl Waldegrave; and Emma Laura (1798&#150;1857), who married Charles Shaw Lefevre, first Viscount Eversley.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Whitbread's political career was one of honest endeavour rather than achievement, though he was among the half-dozen dominant figures of the House of Commons in the years following the deaths of Pitt and Fox. His waywardness was more a symptom than a cause of whig disarray in the period. While he brought many of his difficulties on himself through deficiencies of temperament and judgement, he was to some extent the victim of aristocratic prejudice against his involvement in trade, and he deserved more sympathetic handling than he received from Grey. Sir Robert Heron wrote of him:<blockquote>Though his harsh and overbearing manners had, for a long time, been obnoxious to many of all ranks, and particularly to the poor, even whilst they received benefits from him; yet, the experience of his honesty, his enlightened benevolence, and his indefatigable exertions in almost every department of town and country business had, at length, procured for him universal respect, and, out of Parliament, almost universal acquiescence in his measures; and, probably, few men have been so extensively useful to the country &hellip; In Parliament, his bad taste and, what is perhaps the same thing, want of judgment, above all, his impractical disposition, diminished greatly the advantages which might otherwise have been derived from his great ability as an orator, his experience, and his incorruptible firmness. (Heron, <span class="italic">Notes</span>, 1851, 58&#150;9)</blockquote>Sir Samuel Romilly commented that &#145;the only faults he had proceeded from an excess of his virtues&#146;  (S. Romilly, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 1840, 3.191).<br>
