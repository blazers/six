<span class="headword">Cope, Sir  Anthony</span>  (1486/7&#150;1551), <span class="occ">landowner and courtier</span>, was the second recorded son of William Cope (<i>c</i>.1440&#150;1513), cofferer to Henry VII, of Bedhampton, Hampshire, and Hanwell, Oxfordshire, and an unknown second wife. His father married three times, and Anthony had at least one elder half-brother, Stephen, one brother, and four younger stepsisters (one of whom became Stephen's wife) who were the daughters of William Cope's third wife, Johane Spencer. Anthony Cope was educated at Oxford, according to Wood, who speculates that he attended Oriel College; he does not appear to have graduated. He then travelled in Germany, France, and Italy, visiting various universities, acquiring considerable learning, and writing several books there. These may have included the translation of writings by Galen and Hippocrates that Erasmus refers to in 1516 as made by Cope.<br>
<br>Aged twenty-six on his father's death in 1513, Cope inherited the manor of Hanwell, near Banbury, and other property near by. He completed Hanwell Hall, the mansion that his father had begun there. Much of it was demolished in the late eighteenth century, but surviving portions and earlier drawings show that it was brick-built in the latest court style, two storeys high around a central courtyard, with towers at the corners. At an unknown date he married Jane, daughter of Matthew Crews, of Pynne, in Stoke English parish in Devon, and left one known son, Edward, and one daughter, Anne.<br>
<br>By 1530 Cope had prospered sufficiently, probably from extensive cattle farming, to secure from his elder half-brother Stephen renunciation of his remaining interest in the manor of Hardwick and other property in and around Banbury, and near by in Northamptonshire, and was able to establish himself as a significant gentleman in Oxfordshire. By 1531 he was on the commission of the peace there, and served on it regularly, as well as on the commission for gaol delivery. By about 1530 he was also escheator for Oxfordshire and Berkshire, and in that capacity was soon courting Thomas Cromwell in his correspondence, urging that the king had few friends in the shire, and offering to keep Cromwell's hawks for him. This led in June 1534 to the grant to himself and three others of the wardship of Sir William Spencer's heir, an undoubted source of profit. Later he vainly tried to gain the bishop of Lincoln's fee farm of Banbury by reporting the escape of convicts from the bishop's custody. However, he was one of the Oxfordshire commissioners for the <i>valor ecclesiasticus</i> in 1535, and in 1537 was summoned to bring twenty troops for suppressing the northern rising. His loyalty was undoubted, and had already been rewarded with the estates of Brooke Priory, Rutland, at the dissolution of the smaller monasteries: in 1538 he was recorded as having been receiving a fee from Kenilworth Abbey. Meanwhile he enclosed land. Bishop John Longland of Lincoln protested to Cromwell in 1539 that his tenants were wronged thus, and that Cope would not meet him privately to settle their dispute. He was able and willing to lend money and foreclose on the security, as the courtier Sir Ralph Langford lamented in 1543, apparently from the Fleet prison. He continued to rise in service and status in the shire, taking twelve foot soldiers in the vanguard to France in 1544.<br>
<br>By 1540 Cope was probably adopting protestant views. On 2 September he confronted the vicar of Banbury, John Pitt, before the privy council, and was commended for doing so. As the council told Cope to use his learning at the appropriate time and place, it would appear that the dispute had been theological, and his views somewhat reformed. He had become a courtier, and was one of the esquires in attendance at the magnificent gathering on Blackheath where Henry VIII met Anne of Cleves on 3 January 1541. When the king married Katherine Parr in July 1543, Cope became part of her household, as, successively, keeper of her hawks, vice-chamberlain, and ultimately chamberlain, in charge of thirty-eight people, a position he held until her death in September 1548. In 1544 he published <span class="italic">The Historie of Two of the Moste Noble Capitaines of the Worlde</span>, English lives of Hannibal and Scipio Africanus based on Livy and other Latin writers. Several times reprinted, it is dedicated to Henry VIII, and no doubt there is an element of flattery in the praise lavished on the king for his having subdued the Roman hydra. But <span class="italic">A Godly Meditacion upon XX Select &hellip; Psalms</span> of 1547, a new year's present written for the queen, shows a knowledge of the work of Calvin and Luther, referring to God's elect and just reprobation, and to Katherine's &#145;godly purpose in the reading and study of holy Scripture and the advancement of the true Word of God&#146;  (Cope, xxvii). Of sin he writes that &#145;remedy have we none, but to fly from Thy wrath into the bosom of Thy most dearly beloved SON JESUS CHRIST, making him a bulwark and a shield of defence between thine anger and our offences&#146;  (ibid., 12&#150;13). Such language sounds truly evangelical, though since Edward VI was clearly about to succeed a degree of opportunism may also have been present.<br>
<br>Probably knighted at Edward's coronation Cope became a commissioner under the <span class="roman">Chantries Act</span>, and was sheriff of Oxfordshire and Berkshire for 1547&#150;8. Thus in July 1547 he was deeply involved in the repression of the Oxfordshire revolt against enclosures and the more protestant policies of the new government, led by both craftsmen and conservative priests. He oversaw the hanging of some of the ringleaders, and the setting of their heads atop the highest buildings in their communities. He died, probably at Hanwell Hall, on 5 January 1551, and was buried in the chancel of Hanwell church. His wife, to whom he bequeathed &pound;100 and an annuity of 100 marks, survived him.<br>
