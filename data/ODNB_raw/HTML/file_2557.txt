<span class="headword">Blagrave,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1560, <em>d.</em> 1611), <span class="occ">mathematician</span>, was the second of four sons of John Blagrave of Bulmershe, near Sonning, Berkshire, and Anne, daughter of Sir Anthony Hungerford of Down Ampney, Gloucestershire. He was born at Reading. The date of his birth is unknown, but he was educated at Reading School and was lent mathematical books by Sir Thomas Parry of Hampstead Marshall, Berkshire, who died in 1560. Blagrave had a house at Swallowfield and lived there and at Southcot Lodge, Reading, let to him by his elder brother, Anthony, on a lease of ninety-six years in 1596.<br>
<br>Blagrave was a practical mathematician. He practised as a land surveyor and was among the first to draw estate maps to scale. He also designed and made instruments, including an astrolabe, which he described in <span class="italic">The Mathematical Jewel</span> (1585), whose design modified a number of earlier instruments, particularly that of Gemma Frisius. One astrolabe made to Blagrave's design is known to survive. Between 1589 and 1596 he enjoyed the patronage of Sir Francis Knolles, the dedicatee of <span class="italic">Baculum familliare, catholicon sive generale: a booke of the making and use of a staffe, newly invented by the author, called the familiar staffe</span> (1590), and his family. The &#145;familiar staffe&#146; is an early example of one of the elaborate universal instruments, whose use was short-lived, designed by contemporary mathematical practitioners. In 1596 Blagrave published <span class="italic">Astrolabium Uranicum generale</span> and advertised termly visits to London and arrangements to make his instruments available to customers. Blagrave also made sundials and published <span class="italic">The Art of Dyalling</span> in 1609. He was ranger of the Forest of Dean until 1611. In his will of 1611 Blagrave directed that a stone monument should be erected in St Lawrence's Church, Reading, which would commemorate his skills:<blockquote>representing my said mother w[i]th the hungerfordes and our armes by her and my self lyinge vnder her w[i]th this writinge Johannes Blagrauius totus Mathematicus cum matre sepultus restinge my head on a globe and an astrolabe a quadrant rule and compasse lyinge by me.</blockquote>Blagrave made many bequests to his wife, Dorothy, her daughter, Jane, his relatives, and servants. He also left legacies to enlarge the market place at Reading and to build a portico to St Lawrence's Church. Among other bequests was the annual sum of 20 nobles to a maidservant of good character who had served one master for five years. To avoid partiality, three servants were to be chosen, one from each of the three parishes of the town and in every fifth year from Southcot, should there be a suitable candidate. Lots were to be cast on Good Friday to select the recipient of the money. Blagrave died on 9 August 1611 and was buried two days later in St Lawrence's Church. An elaborate monument of himself, surrounded by allegorical figures, was erected, which approximated to the directions of his will.<br>
