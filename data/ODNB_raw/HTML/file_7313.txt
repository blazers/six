<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Davy,  Henry</span>  (1793&#150;1865), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born at The Poplars (later Birketts Farm), Westhall, Suffolk, on 30 May 1793, the fifth son and youngest child of Thomas Davy (1747&#150;1813), farmer, and his second wife, Sarah (1751&#150;1831), eldest daughter of William Gibson, physician, of Willingham Hall, near Beccles. He was apprenticed without prospects to a Halesworth grocer, but with aspirations to art he went instead to John Sell Cotman, then at Great Yarmouth. Within two years of modest beginnings in 1813 he was confidently etching his own drawings: in 1818 he published ten prints of Beccles and its environs, <span class="italic">A Set of Etchings Illustrative of Beccles Church and other Suffolk Antiquities</span>. This was very much in the style he absorbed by helping to etch Cotman's plates of Norfolk antiquities and brasses published in the latter's <span class="italic">A Series of Etchings Illustrative of the Architectural Antiquities of Norfolk</span> (1818) and <span class="italic">Engravings of the most Remarkable of the Sepulchral Brasses in Norfolk</span> (1819). With Joseph Lambert's assistance instead of Davy's, the plates illustrative of Cotman's <span class="italic">The Architectural Antiquities of Normandy</span> (1822) are comparatively dull.<br>
<br>In 1819 Davy continued his training under George Cooke in London, but soon returned to Bury St Edmunds to draw in the area and to seek new patrons. Though not a member, he exhibited twenty-three pictures in all at the Norwich Society of Artists between 1817 and 1823. Back in Southwold in the early 1820s he met Sarah (1801&#150;1854), daughter of James Bardwell, master mariner and stationer, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Critten, whom he married at St Peter's, Ipswich, on 30 November 1824. To boost his income from teaching he opened a public library and reading-room. Davy could now add sixty etchings to the Beccles set for his <span class="italic">Series of Etchings Illustrative of the Architectural Antiquities of Suffolk</span> (1827), and dedicated one to Cotman. The Suffolk antiquary and genealogist David Elisha Davy of Rumburgh wrote, anonymously, descriptions of the churches, houses, and castles in the three collections Henry published; despite long subscribers' lists (Cotman always included), the books made a loss, and his <span class="italic">Views of the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen in Suffolk</span> (1827) was abandoned after only twenty houses had been engraved by Lambert after Davy's exquisite sepia drawings.<br>
<br>After further offers of &#145;Instructions in Drawing and Sketching from Nature&#146;  (Denney, 29) in Southwold, Davy moved the family in 1829 first to Whitton Road and then to 16 Globe Street, Ipswich. That year he exhibited at the Society (later Royal Society) of British Artists, Suffolk Street, London, three small watercolours or prints of Southwold landscapes. On 16 April 1833 Robert Deck, the printer of his two main works, auctioned some of the family's furniture and books to pay himself and other creditors. In Ipswich the Davys always struggled for survival, and of their sixteen children only six survived infancy. Two were artists: Frederick, of Ipswich and later Chesterfield, and Henry George, of Halifax. Still taking pupils (notably the daughters of the poet Elizabeth Cobbold), Davy decided to print his own plates and sell them singly for a few shillings each. The influence of Cotman is no longer apparent in the 200 prints etched between 1835 and 1849 and forty-four lithographs executed between 1850 and 1864. Small editions and the destruction of plates on his death make them all rare. The meticulous detail in 134 prints of east Suffolk churches assists architects still. Davy made journalistic illustrations of local events, such as f&ecirc;tes, bazaars, railway and dock openings, a lifeboat launching, and the laying of the foundation-stone of the new Ipswich grammar school by Prince Albert. When in 1844 Lord William Hill rode head first into an oak, the etched scene was on sale in days. In 1849, for D. E. Davy's Suffolk collections, Davy provided 1300 of his own drawings, and organized the engraved views and portraits of others.<br>
<br>Davy's wife, Sarah, died in 1854, aged fifty-two, leaving him still with two young children to bring up. Slight, unassuming, of few words, but a great walker, he worked on through failing health until he suffered a fatal heart attack on 8 February 1865. After an inquest at The Globe inn, almost next door, he was buried at Ipswich cemetery on the 14th. Sarah's grave in St Matthew's churchyard was unmarked, but Henry Davy's stone has a joint inscription. His later work, always careful, lacked the flair he displayed while Cotman's influence lasted, but the record he made of his half-county over four decades combines charm and delicacy with admirable accuracy.<br>
