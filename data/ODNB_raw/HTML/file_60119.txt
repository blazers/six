<span class="headword">Wycombe,  W.  of</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1275), <span class="occ">music copyist and Benedictine monk</span>, is of unknown origins. He became a monk of Reading Abbey, and inscriptions in two Reading manuscripts testify that he wrote music, but unfortunately nothing that is extant can unequivocally be ascribed to him. Wycombe describes himself, in a statement he wrote with a metal stylus at the end of Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 125 (fols. 98<i>v</i>&#150;99), as the precentor (the monk exercising overall control over the performance of services) at Leominster Priory, Herefordshire, a cell of Reading Abbey, where he stayed for four years. During this time he says he copied numerous manuscripts, musical and non-musical. He makes it clear that the work burdened him considerably, &#145;though it might have appeared small&#146;, and generally gives the impression that his time at Leominster&#151;used by Reading as something of a dumping ground for troublesome monks&#151;was spent there under sufferance. The antepenultimate paragraph mentions a <span class="italic">Historia</span> of St Margaret by Brother Hugh of Wycombe and states that <i>notam cantus</i> <i>W.</i> <i>ipse imposuit</i> (&#145;W. himself provided the notation of the chant&#146;). Wycombe's wording here is clearly designed to establish him firmly as the composer of what probably took the form of a rhymed office. It is noticeably different from his more common construction <i>scripsit eciam</i> (&#145;he also wrote&#146;) by which he describes, in the paragraph which follows, his copying of two rolls containing polyphonic music. In fact, two such rolls survive: Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Rawlinson C 400*, and the recently discovered Oxford, Bodleian, MS Lat. liturg. b. 19, both from the vicinity of Reading, though probably not the abbey. As Wycombe is not slow in establishing his status as a composer, his milder wording for the rolls suggests that he merely copied, rather than composed, this music, if indeed these be the rolls he mentions.<br>
<br>The name &#145;W. de Wic.&#146; also occurs in the index of a book, now lost, belonging to W. of Winchester, another monk of Reading and Leominster in the years on either side of 1300. This index was copied on the last folios (160<i>v</i>&#150;161) of British Library, MS Harley 978, for whose main corpus obits and other palaeographical evidence certainly indicate Reading provenance. After the first eight items of the index is written <i>postea responsoria</i> <i>W. de Wicumbe</i>; following a small gap over forty Alleluia settings are listed (the Alleluia being a responsorial chant), forming a complete cycle. It is reasonable to assume that the statement &#145;there follow responsories of W. de Wycombe&#146; refers either to the cycle of Alleluias subsequent to the first eight items, or else to a lacuna in the index, indicating that Wycombe's responsories are missing at this point. Several titles among the Alleluia settings come close to matching compositions in the so-called Worcester fragments. While the idea that some of Wycombe's compositions survive is seductive, the connections between Reading and Worcester have possibly been overstated and should be treated with caution.<br>
<br>Wycombe has also been suggested as the composer of the famous canon &#145;Sumer is icumen in&#146;, which occurs in the first fascicle of MS Harley 978. However, this fascicle is ruled to a size of written block different from that of the rest of the volume, and has been cut down from its original size. This raises doubts as to its original provenance, hence also to indisputable Reading origins for the &#145;Sumer&#146; canon, and thus to any connection with Wycombe. In any case, there were presumably many other composers active at Reading.<br>
