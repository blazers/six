<span class="headword">Corbyn,  Thomas</span>  (1711&#150;1791), <span class="occ">pharmaceutical chemist</span>, was born on 13 February 1711 in Worcester, the son of John Corbyn and his wife, Candia, daughter of John and Cecilia Handley of Pontypool. His parents were members of the Society of Friends. He was apprenticed for eight years from September 1728 to Joseph Clutton, citizen and apothecary of London. His time finished, he continued to work with Clutton and did not apply for his freedom of the Society of Apothecaries until April 1743, the year in which his employer died. Mrs Clutton decided to continue the business herself, and as the sole surviving son, Morris Clutton, was only four years into his apprenticeship with his father, Corbyn was brought into the business. A co-partnership was finally formed when Mrs Clutton remarried and Morris Clutton gained his freedom of the Society of Apothecaries in July 1747. Each partner put in about &pound;2000.<br>
<br>Joseph Clutton had spread his pharmaceutical interests beyond the confines of London; for example, he had been the &#145;chymical&#146; supplier to the county hospital in Winchester since 1739. Some years before Clutton's death, Corbyn had been sending letters to overseas correspondents. From extant letter-books it is known that by 1741 Corbyn had developed a good trade with the American colonies, in February sending &#145;Jesuit's Bark&#146;, rhubarb, and cinnamon to Virginia, and soon after importing drugs such as senega. Corbyn was a staunch upholder of the purity of drugs, though well aware of the increased profits he could make if he descended to adulteration. In 1750 he wrote to John and Esther White in Pennsylvania, &#145;The simple drugs are the best of their kind, and the composition not only true, but curiously prepared, and charg'd reasonable according to the market price&#146;  (Western MSS 5435&#150;5460). In 1752 Corbyn married Sarah Garret of Colchester; they had two daughters and a son. In 1754 he wrote to his cousin, John Corbyn, a doctor in New England, &#145;I don't know any thing particularly new &amp; valuable in Physick. My wife has br[ough]t me a new girl now ab[ou]t 6 weeks old and thrives well&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Corbyn's probity both at home and abroad was an important factor in the success of the firm. When Morris Clutton died in 1754, a balance sheet shows that the concern had increased in value from about &pound;4000 to some &pound;14,000 in the seven years of the partnership. Corbyn also seems to have had no difficulty in raising the necessary capital to buy out Clutton's heirs. For a while he ran the firm alone but by 1762 he had entered into agreements with John Brown and Nicholas Marshall. When Marshall died in 1776 he was replaced by John Beaumont, and ten years later Beaumont's brother-in-law, Josiah Messer, joined the group. They in turn were followed by Beaumont's son, Abraham, and two more Josiah Messers&#151;strong evidence of the close Quaker network both in business and family life. The most important partner, however, proved to be George Stacey, John Beaumont's son-in-law and the first of a dynasty of Staceys.<br>
<br>Corbyn had an excellent relationship with his suppliers, customers, and agents, but he expected prompt payment and did not hesitate to say so. He saw the necessity for taking out insurance, and in 1788 he published in the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> an article entitled &#145;Advantage of insurers or underwriters to merchants and traders exporting goods&#146;. He also produced a catalogue, <span class="italic">Chemical and galenical medicine truly prepared and sold with all sorts of drugs, by Thomas Corbyn. Chemist and druggists, at the Bell and Dragon in Holborn, London. 1 month [January] 1789</span>.<br>
<br>Corbyn remained an active Quaker. In the severe winter of 1767 he joined with a number of other Friends in John Fothergill's scheme for the relief of the poor. Fish and potatoes were purchased at wholesale prices and sold at a small loss from established warehouses. He was, however, severe, authoritarian, and uncompromising in his attitudes, so much so that he was nicknamed &#145;the Quaker pope&#146;. He clashed with William Cookworthy in Plymouth over disownment and the implementation of rigid discipline. However, James Jenkins wrote that he frequently lent money to young men starting in business&#151;and not infrequently lost it.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life, Corbyn moved from High Holborn to Bartholomew Close, where he died a widower on 14 February 1791. In his will he bequeathed sums of 5 to 50 guineas to his partners and employees, and to his Quaker friends and executors, and nearly &pound;2000 in government securities to relatives and the Society of Friends. His son, John, already a partner, was to receive the property in Holborn and Coldbath Fields provided he paid &pound;4200 to the executors. The residue of the estate was divided equally between all three children. The life and career of Thomas Corbyn shows that the expanding drug trade of the eighteenth century was based on greater trust and probity than is often thought.<br>
