<span class="headword">Robertson,  George Matthew</span>  (1864&#150;1932), <span class="occ">psychiatrist</span>, was born at Simla on 15 May 1864, the son of Colonel John Robertson of Liddington Hall, Guildford, and his wife, Marie Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rique Gumbert. He attended Madras College, St Andrews, and studied medicine at Edinburgh University, graduating MB ChB in 1885. He did not take his MD until 1913, when, however, he received a gold medal for his thesis on general paralysis of the insane. After working as a resident physician at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and in the university's pathological laboratory, he spent time at the Bethlem Royal Hospital, London, and the National Hospital, Queen Square, London. At the latter he was greatly impressed by the teaching of John Hughlings Jackson.<br>
<br>Robertson was subsequently appointed to the post of assistant physician at the Morningside Asylum, Edinburgh, under Thomas Clouston. In 1890 he won the Gaskell prize of the Royal Medico-Psychological Association, followed by the bronze medal two years later. He attained the MRCP Edin. in 1891, and was elected a fellow in 1893. During this period he also visited Hippolyte Bernhiem and J. M. Charcot in France to observe the use of hypnotism in the treatment of the insane, and described his findings in two papers in 1892. He occupied, in succession, the posts of superintendent of the Perth District Asylum at Murthly (1892&#150;9), and of the Stirling District Asylum (1899&#150;1908). During this period, Robertson made several innovations in patient care. At Murthly he was responsible for creating the villa system of housing patients, and he also introduced hospital trained nurses into the wards. At Stirling he arranged for certain groups of male patients to be placed under the charge of female nurses both night and day. Robertson built upon these innovations, which he styled the &#145;hospitalisation of the asylum&#146;, when he succeeded Clouston as superintendent of the Morningside Asylum (later the Royal Edinburgh Asylum) in 1908. In 1898 he married Lilias Catherine Buchanan (<i>d</i>. 1914), daughter of Daniel Ritchie, of Blackwood, Victoria, and widow of George Buchanan of Arden; they had a son.<br>
<br>At Edinburgh, Robertson established a series of nursing homes for the treatment of patients with milder forms of mental illness, who did not require either hospital admission or compulsory certification. The success of this scheme, which was available only to those patients who could afford to pay, led Robertson to extend the scheme to poorer patients by opening the Jordanburn Nerve Hospital in 1929. This unit was also one of the first to make provision for the out-patient treatment of mental illness. Robertson's final innovation was the creation of a special residential clinic for the treatment of children with emotional and behavioural disorders. In 1910 he was appointed lecturer in mental diseases at Edinburgh University. The status of the lectureship was raised to that of a chair in 1919, and Robertson became the first professor of psychiatry in Scotland in 1920. He left no extended work on the subject of mental illness, and his writings consisted of occasional papers on practical aspects of patient care and the history of psychiatry. None of these was considered to be original by his contemporaries, and, perhaps as a result of his unremarkable output, Robertson has not been the subject of scholarly reassessment. His main contribution was in helping to transform the medical response to the mentally ill into one that was more flexible and less coercive.<br>
<br>Robertson was Morison lecturer (1911, 1913, 1927), Maudsley lecturer (1926, 1927), president of the Royal Medico-Psychological Association (1922), president of the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh (1925&#150;7), and Cullen prizeman (1930). He was also president of the British Medical Association's Edinburgh branch (1926) and of the section for mental diseases (1922, 1927). In 1931, St Andrews University awarded him the degree of LLD, and he was elected an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh, in 1927. He gave evidence before the royal commission on lunacy in 1924 and was involved in the discussions that took place prior to the passing of the <span class="roman">Mental Treatment Act for England</span> in 1930. Robertson was described by contemporaries as a genial, kindly man, with a penchant for the dramatic. He died from heart disease at Tipperlinn House, Morningside Place, Edinburgh, on 28 March 1932, and was buried three days later at St Cuthbert's, Edinburgh.<br>
