<span class="headword">Murray,  David Christie</span>  (1847&#150;1907), <span class="occ">novelist and journalist</span>, born on 13 April 1847 in High Street, West Bromwich, Staffordshire, was one of the six sons and five daughters of William Murray, printer and stationer of West Bromwich, and his wife, Mary Withers. He attended private schools at West Bromwich and Spon Lane, Staffordshire, but at the age of twelve was set to work in his father's printing office.<br>
<br>Murray began his career in journalism at an early age by writing leaders for the <span class="italic">Wednesbury Advertiser</span>. He soon became part of the staff of the <span class="italic">Birmingham Morning News</span> working under George Dawson, reporting police court cases at 25<i>s</i>. a week and rapidly winning the approval of his employer as an admirable descriptive writer, notably in his descriptions of colliery disasters which brought him more than a local reputation. In January 1865&#151;without friends, funds, or prospects&#151;he went to London, where he found casual employment at Messrs Unwin Brothers' printing works. In May he enlisted as a private in the 4th Royal Irish dragoon guards, and accompanied his regiment to Ireland, but after a year a great-aunt purchased his discharge. From that time his profession was journalism or foreign correspondence, varied by novel-writing. When in London he passed his time in bohemian society. In 1871 he became parliamentary reporter for the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> and on 5 September of that year married Sophia Harris (<i>b</i>. 1847/8) of Rowley Regis, near Birmingham, daughter of William Harris, a farmer. They had one daughter, who died young. After his wife's death he married, on 17 November 1880, Alice Lydia Mary West (<i>b</i>. 1856/7), daughter of William West, a warehouseman; they had one son, Archibald. He also had four illegitimate children.<br>
<br>Murray travelled a great deal and wrote extensively on foreign affairs. He represented <span class="italic">The Times</span> and <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877&#150;8. He described a tour through England in the disguise of a tramp in a series of articles for <span class="italic">Mayfair</span>. From 1881 to 1886 he lived mainly in Belgium and France, and from 1889 to 1891 he was based in Nice. Subsequently he resided for a time in north Wales. He made lecture tours through Australia and New Zealand in 1889&#150;91, and through the United States and Canada in 1894&#150;5. Australia was described by him in articles in the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> in 1891. In <span class="italic">The Cockney Columbus</span> (1898) he collected letters on the United States from the <span class="italic">New York Herald</span>. In 1892 he was editor of <span class="italic">The Morning</span>, a short-lived Conservative daily London paper. A few years later he contributed ethical, literary, and political articles to <span class="italic">The Referee</span>, which were collected as <span class="italic">Guesses at Truth</span> (1908). From 1898 he devoted much energy to writing and lecturing to support Emile Zola's plea on behalf of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a French officer, who had been wrongfully condemned for espionage.<br>
<br>In 1879 Murray had contributed his first novel, <span class="italic">A Life's Atonement</span>, periodically to <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal of Popular Literature, Science and Arts</span>. From then until his death in 1907 scarcely a year passed without the publication of one or at times two novels. Between 1887 and 1907 he occasionally collaborated with Henry Herman or Alfred Egmont Hake. His novels <span class="italic">Joseph's Coat</span> (1881) and <span class="italic">Val Strange</span> (1882) achieved a notable success. <span class="italic">By the Gate of the Sea</span> (1883) and <span class="italic">Rainbow Gold</span> (1885), which first appeared in serial form in the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> under the editorship of James Payn, assured his reputation. <span class="italic">Aunt Rachel</span> (1886) was critically acclaimed. Murray's fiction abounds in vigour. The loosely constructed plots contain incidents drawn freely from his journalistic experiences. His style gives evidence of his profession as a journalist, but he is effective in describing the neighbourhood and inhabitants of Cannock Chase, the area in Staffordshire which served as a setting for most of his novels. He also wrote several volumes of rambling autobiography, including <span class="italic">A Novelist's Notebook</span> (1887), <span class="italic">The Making of a Novelist: an Experiment in Autobiography</span> (1894), and <span class="italic">Recollections</span>, the last published posthumously in 1908.<br>
<br>Murray died at his home, 4 Lancaster Road, Belsize Park, London, on 1 August 1907 after a long illness caused by abdominal problems, during which he endured much discomfort. He was buried at Hampstead. A memorial tablet in copper with a pewter medallion was unveiled at West Bromwich Public Library in December 1908.<br>
