<span class="headword">Moore,  Frances</span>  (1788/9&#150;1881), <span class="occ">historian and novelist</span>, was born at Carlingford, co. Louth, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19141/', "Peter Moore (1753&#150;1828)")</script>, a former Indian civil servant who became MP for Coventry in 1803, and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. before 1798), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Richmond Webb of Bandon, co. Cork. She was one of a family of five sons (only one of whom survived his father) and two daughters. Her father was the director of several shaky companies, which crashed in 1824&#150;5, and after the loss of his seat in 1826 he was forced to flee to France to escape arrest. At his death, in 1828 at Abbeville, he is said to have left his two daughters &#145;respectably provided for&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 568); in 1881 her income was derived from annuities and land.<br>
<br>Frances Moore's short literary career began with the publication of several novels, under the pseudonym &#145;Madame Panache&#146;. Her second novel, <span class="italic">Manners</span> (1817), commented on the work of other novelists and examined social distinctions in an English village and in Ireland. <span class="italic">A Year and a Day</span> (1818) is a well-written and restrained silver-fork novel, which deals with the love of a fashionable man for the fascinating, unconventional, but ultimately virtuous wife of an elderly aristocrat. It was possibly inspired by the less reputable career of Lady Caroline Lamb.<br>
<br>Moore's most important publication, however, is her <span class="italic">Historical Life of Joanna of Sicily</span> (1824). This substantial biography begins with a long introductory digression on the history and literature of Provence and Italy in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Controversially, Moore portrayed Joanna as entirely innocent of the murder of her first husband, Andrew of Hungary, viewing her as the victim of treacherous men. The critic of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> of December 1824 firmly opposed her interpretation of Andrew's assassination, and criticized her inclusion of superfluous material. The <span class="italic">Eclectic Review</span> was more sympathetic, describing the work as an &#145;elaborate and elegant historical miscellany&#146;  (p. 412) and professing an open mind with respect to Andrew's murder. Despite its shortcomings, all subsequent English-language biographies of Joanna are substantially based on Moore's <span class="italic">Life</span>. Moore's only subsequent publication seems to have been a translation of two volumes of Carlo Botta's <span class="italic">History of Italy</span>, published in 1828, with a useful preface considering Botta's career and its influence on his account of Italy under Napoleon.<br>
<br>Frances Moore's later life is very obscure. She seems to have lived for some years in Carlingford, co. Louth. Then she moved to 16 Park Street in Taunton, where she may have resided with a nephew. In 1881 she was living at 6 Queen's Terrace, Exeter, with her three nieces. She died at Queen Square, Mount Radford, in Exeter on 6 June of that year at the age of ninety-two.<br>
