<span class="headword">Aird,  Ian</span>  (1905&#150;1962), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born on 4 July 1905 at Belgrave Terrace, Corstorphine, Edinburgh, the first of two sons of William Aird (<i>b</i>. 1872), master tailor, and his wife, Jean Elizabeth Ogle (formerly Binnie). Both parents were lowland Scots, the father's forebears from Maybole and the mother's from Carstairs. Aird attended George Watson's College, Edinburgh, from 1914 to 1923. His reputation was bookish&#151;he took Russian as an extra subject. At Edinburgh University he read medicine and graduated MB ChB in 1928. Apart from a continental tour most of his postgraduate training continued in Edinburgh under David Wilkie, Henry Wade, Norman Dott, and James Graham. He became FRCS (Edinburgh) in 1932. In 1934 the Medical Research Council awarded him a Rockefeller scholarship to Washington University (St Louis) with Evarts Graham, and he also spent a month at the Mayo Clinic. During his absence he was appointed assistant surgeon at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital for Sick Children. He took the degree of ChM (with high commendation) in 1936 and in December that year married (Beatrice) Margaret Cowes (1907&#150;1992), of Kinghorn, Fife; there was a daughter, Heather, and a son, Ian Alisdair.<br>
<br>As a Territorial Force volunteer Aird was mobilized in October 1939; he was eventually to command the first mobile surgical unit in the western desert and was twice mentioned in dispatches, once after he had apparently confronted General Erwin Rommel in the surgeon's operating tent during a brief period of captivity. After an attack of renal colic in 1943 he was repatriated with the rank of lieutenant-colonel and returned to civilian surgery in Edinburgh, where he was assistant to Professor James Learmonth and assistant director of the Wilkie Research Laboratory. In 1946 he succeeded Grey Turner as professor of surgery in London University at the British Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith, taking over a department of surgery which was not well provided with accommodation or equipment.<br>
<br>In the ensuing fifteen years Aird devoted himself to creating a research and clinical organization which came to possess international renown. Prominent among the themes he supported and supervised were: the development of heart&#150;lung bypass and cardiac surgery; renal transplantation; and the early identification of the association of blood groups with a number of diseases. In the United Kingdom the clinical applications of the advances in the first two areas were somewhat slow because of a &#145;non-surgical&#146; attitude among some of his medical colleagues, but eventually, with the zeal of his associates in the UK, Europe, and North America, both flourished in the late 1950s and after Aird's death. In the public mind Aird was linked with the separation of conjoint twins, which confirmed him as a surgical planner of high ability (though not with outstanding surgical performance unless the problem interested him) but also led to confrontations with the British popular press. He was much admired as a teacher and his single-author, unillustrated work, <span class="italic">A Companion in Surgical Studies</span> (1949; 2nd edn, 1953)&#151;a development of lecture notes for a successful tutorial course in Edinburgh&#151;became well-nigh essential for surgical trainees. It is arguable that the force of his personality and the undoubted clarity of writing in the <span class="italic">Companion</span> helped to set the post-war syllabus for the fellowship examinations of the British colleges of surgeons. He was also a pioneer of the use of film and closed-circuit television in surgical education.<br>
<br>Aird's contemporaries remember him as one with &#145;almost a foghorn voice, which combined with his short stature produced a commanding presence&#146;; as &#145;having a good debating mind and [someone] who never liked to be defeated in argument&#146;; as &#145;an inspiring leader, ruthlessly honest and without circumlocution&#146;; as of &#145;consummate loyalty to his trainees&#146;; as &#145;a scintillating teacher with incredible off-the-cuff ideas and shafts of wisdom&#146;; and as having &#145;a combination of external bonhomie and inner turmoil&#146;  (private information). His obvious pleasure in the company of others (on his own terms) made him an internationally popular figure and, coupled with his linguistic ability in both the Romance languages and Russian, he was much in demand for lecturing and visiting, to which he tirelessly responded. In addition to his exceptional knowledge of his profession, he was a gifted pianist and kept a concert grand in his flat at the hospital.<br>
<br>In 1953 Aird was elected to the council of the Royal College of Surgeons, London (FRCS <i>ad eundem</i>, 1946), which he served until his death. He was particularly valued for his advice on surgical education. In 1957, at the time of his appointment as an honorary fellow of the American College of Surgeons together with John Bruce, he and Bruce were responsible with J. William Hinton for founding the James IV Association, a charitable foundation to finance international travel for young surgeons. Aird became its first president. In 1962 he received the Liston Victoria jubilee prize of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. A project to which he devoted much effort&#151;ahead of his time&#151;was an attempt to form international surgical teams for disaster relief from the staff of academic departments.<br>
<br>The incessant peripatetic activity and self-demanding lifestyle probably affected Aird's mental and physical health. He much enjoyed entertaining others and had a fondness for Scotch whisky, but the latter did not seem to affect his intellectual or surgical ability. It came as a surprise to his professional acquaintances, therefore, when on 17 September 1962 he committed suicide by barbiturate poisoning at his flat in the Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, London. His note to the coroner expressed disappointment in the reception of his department's achievements by his peers and by grant-giving bodies, and commented on personal depression and intellectual decline; both, however, were scarcely apparent to others. Aird was cremated at Mortlake crematorium and his ashes were scattered there; a memorial service was held in the church of St Columba in London. He is remembered at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School (later a division of Imperial College school of medicine) by an annual lecture.<br>
