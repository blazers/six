<span class="headword">Linton,  William</span>  (1791&#150;1876), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born at Liverpool on 22 April 1791, the son of William Linton and Sarah Brockbank, and was probably the child baptized on 6 May at Benn's Garden Unitarian Chapel, the son of William Linton, mariner, and his wife, Sarah, of Park Lane. His mother married Thomas Eskrigge in Lancaster on 11 August 1796. Linton grew up at Lancaster and Cartmel. After schooling at Windermere, he went on to Rochdale, Lancashire, where he spent six years studying the classics, mathematics, and drawing. Holidays were spent in Windermere, where his mother's family had an estate, and his days rambling and drawing in the mountains made him long to be a landscape painter. There, he came under the influence of the self-taught landscape painter William Havell (1872&#150;1857).<br>
<br>However, at sixteen, Linton's artistic aspirations were thwarted when his family placed him in a merchant's office at Liverpool, where he was articled for five years. He still managed to make truant visits to the Lake District, where he painted landscapes and carried out some hasty commissions of local views, and nourished his love of painting by visiting at Mold the tomb of Richard Wilson, whose Italianate classical landscapes he saw and copied at Ince Blundell Hall and at Wynnstay. His enthusiasm for the genre was strengthened by the Claudes he saw at Holker Hall, near Windermere. Yet it was not until he had completed four more years of classical and mathematical study at Windermere that, aged about twenty-four, he was finally allowed to attempt life as a painter in London.<br>
<br>Despite early disappointments, Linton soon made his mark. He began sketching in oils from nature during visits to Hampstead Heath and the countryside around London. In 1817, living at 34 Duke Street, Manchester Square, he first succeeded in getting his work exhibited, showing three landscapes at the Royal Academy, and another at the British Institution. At these two venues, he continued to exhibit annually for more than forty years, sending fifty-seven works to the former and seventy-eight to the latter. From 1830 to 1865 he also exhibited regularly at the Liverpool Academy, though he continued to live in London, by 1822 at 19 Blenheim Street.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Morning after a Storm</span> (exh. British Institution, 1823), painted near Lynton, Devon, was his first work to obtain notice. <span class="italic">Delos</span> (exh. Society of British Artists (SBA), 1825; possibly the version in Wolverhampton Art Gallery) was purchased on the advice of Turner and led to the sixth duke of Bedford's commissioning <span class="italic">An Italian Scene, Evening</span> (exh. British Institution, 1826) for Woburn Abbey. Linton was among the artists and art-lovers who met regularly at the Bull and Bush tavern at North End. Their discussions led in 1823 to the founding of the Society of British Artists, to provide greater possibility for artists to exhibit their work. Its first secretary, Linton became its vice-president in 1836 and its president in 1837. In 1824 he sent eleven British landscapes, including <span class="italic">The Vale of Lonsdale</span>, to its opening exhibition, and a seascape to the Paris Salon. Between 1824 and 1869 he exhibited over a hundred works at the society's galleries in Suffolk Street.<br>
<br>As well as painting all over England, Scotland, and Wales and particularly in his native Lancashire, Linton produced large idealized classical paintings, like <span class="italic">Aeneas and Achates</span> (exh. SBA, 1828) and <span class="italic">Caius Marius amid Ruins of Carthage</span> (exh. SBA, 1834). These were done from his imagination, and from his wide knowledge of classical literature and archaeology, without his ever having left England. With these works, considered his greatest achievements by his contemporaries, Linton's reputation was established. In 1828 he embarked on a tour of France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, when he made over 500 sketches from nature. Many of these formed the basis of later studio paintings, but even these more realistic landscapes were often chosen for their classical or literary associations. His catalogue descriptions of his paintings were heavily annotated with quotations from the classics or the works of classical scholars. His British landscapes were also often annotated from literary sources. On this trip Linton spent fifteen months in Italy and the winter of 1828 in Rome, where he daily met other English artists, including Turner. For his two-volume <span class="italic">Sketches in Italy</span>, published in 1832, Linton wrote the descriptive texts and supplied lithographs based on his work. After returning to England he married Julia Adeline, daughter of the Revd Thomas Swettenham, rector of Swettenham, and of Anna Antonia Hayes, at Shillinglee, Sussex, on 27 October 1831. On marrying, he acquired a second address, Downshire Hill Cottage, Hampstead.<br>
<br>Linton's large <span class="italic">Ancient Jerusalem, during the approach of the miraculous darkness which attended the crucifixion</span> (exh. SBA, 1836) was awarded a case of silver medals by Pope Gregory XVI; when it was reproduced in a mezzotint by Thomas Lupton, the first subscriber was the archbishop of Canterbury. One of his most celebrated paintings, <span class="italic">Embarkation of the Greeks for the Trojan War</span> (exh. SBA, 1839), was another large imaginative construction. After a fifteen-month tour of Greece, Sicily, and Calabria, he exhibited nearly 300 sketches from his trip at the New Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1842, and held further exhibitions at his home at 7 Lodge Place, Hanover Gate, where he had moved by 1837, and at Lancaster, Manchester, and Liverpool. These sketches formed the basis of his <span class="italic">The Scenery of Greece and its Islands</span>, published privately in 1856, with fifty steel engravings by himself; a second commercial edition followed in 1869. His last European trip, a twelve-month exploration of the Mediterranean coast from Nice to Spezia, was made in 1843&#150;4. His large <span class="italic">Temple of Paestum</span> (Tate Collection), shown at the Westminster exhibition in 1847 and, as he noted in his will, &#145;reputed my best work&#146;, was bequeathed by him to the National Gallery, London. Another Italian scene, <span class="italic">A Festa Day at Venice&#151;the Grand Canal</span> (exh. RA, 1851), was awarded a 50 guinea prize at the Royal Institute of Manchester. Despite his large output of Greek and Italian subjects, Linton continued to paint his beloved native countryside. One of several depictions of his home town of Lancaster (on loan to Lancaster City Museum) was lithographed and dedicated (by permission) to Queen Victoria in honour of the royal visit to the city in 1851.<br>
<br>Linton's interest in the technical and archaeological basis of his painting resulted in two more publications. In 1851 Prince Albert presented him with two bronze medals for being an associate juror in the chemical class at the Great Exhibition. He soon published <span class="italic">Ancient and Modern Colours</span> (1852), which records his studies of the artistic and chemical properties of pigments used by ancient and modern painters. This was later published privately in tabular form (<i>c</i>.1859). His last publication, <span class="italic">Colossal Vestiges of the Older Nations</span> (1862), which surveys ruins throughout the world, reflects his interest in archaeology and the scholarship that underlay his landscapes.<br>
<br>In his last years Linton's work fell out of fashion. It had always been eclipsed by that of Turner, who had influenced some of his paintings. Yet, after Turner, he was the best practitioner of landscape in the classical tradition of his day. Large two-day sales of the &#145;Entire collection&#146; of his works were held at Christies in 1860 and 1865, as well as a posthumous studio sale in 1877. He died at his house at 7 Lodge Place on 18 August 1876, his wife having predeceased him. In his will&#151;written on 15 September 1874 and proved on 21 August 1877&#151;his principal heirs were his sister, Frances Eskrigge of Morecambe, and his Eskrigge nephews. Examples of his paintings are held in Lancaster City Museum and Wolverhampton Art Gallery.<br>
