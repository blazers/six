<span class="headword">Payne,  William</span>  (1760&#150;1830), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born on 4 March 1760 in London, the son of William Payne (1730&#150;1794), and his wife, Eleanor Vardon (<i>fl</i>. 1728&#150;1796). His father was a hop and coal merchant residing in Westminster, but was originally from Burwash in Sussex. In 1778, two years after he had first exhibited at the Society of Artists of Great Britain, Payne obtained a post as a draughtsman in the Board of Ordnance at the Tower of London, where he was instructed by the chief drawing master, Henry Gilder, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Thomas Sandby. In 1783 he was sent to Plymouth to survey the defences of Plymouth Dock (now Devonport): he spent the next six years mapping the coastal redoubts and making watercolours of the area. By 1786 his technique had advanced far enough for him to send drawings to the Royal Academy. In Plymouth, on 5 February 1785, he married Jane Goodridge (<i>fl</i>. 1763&#150;1818); three of their eight children were born there.<br>
<br>Although working initially with the reed pen in a manner close to Paul and Thomas Sandby, Payne invented a number of devices which he used throughout his career. These included dragging colour with the side of the brush, reinforced by striations (parallel lines), to denote broken ground, and vigorously drawn loops of foliage. He also used for his foregrounds a grey pigment&#151;still known as Payne's grey&#151;a compound of Prussian blue, lake, and yellow ochre, which he had first employed in 1783 for a map of redoubts on Maker heights. With neatly applied colours he recorded the local topography, enlivened by well observed figures, thus attracting the praise of Sir Joshua Reynolds for some quarry views (exh. RA, 1788&#150;9; Stourhead, and priv. coll.). By 1790 he had decided to pursue a career as an artist and drawing-master in London. He now adopted a looser style, which pupils could more readily copy, working with brush outlines (sometimes split, for foliage) rather than the pen, and he made more use of Payne's grey, adding indigo (unfortunately a colour subject to fading) and reddish hues to his pictures. He created landscapes, usually in a small format, with rocks or trees as a framing device, in which peasants converse or seafarers&#151;some of them smugglers&#151;haul on ropes or load contraband onto pack-horses.<br>
<br>Payne's work was highly admired and he soon became the most fashionable drawing-master of the day. He numbered some professional artists among his pupils, including his eldest son, William Robert (who achieved little success), and John Glover, but he was more sought after as a teacher by aristocratic amateurs. As a result, a craze for manufacturing Payne-like landscapes became a feature of the fashionable London scene. After 1790 he ceased to exhibit for nineteen years and travelled in search of picturesque material to the west country and south Wales (from 1791), and later to the Isle of Wight, the Lake District, and north Wales. Although his pictures still commanded high prices when he started exhibiting again, upon joining the Old Watercolour Society in 1809, within a decade his popularity had declined, as new artists emerged. He attracted one important commission in 1818 from John Trower, an amateur artist, to work up some of Trower's Italian views, but his use of heightened pigments in body colour in the 1820s was hardly successful. The large oil paintings of this period (including a self-portrait now in the Castle Museum, Nottingham, showing a somewhat stern, bespectacled figure) display the same mannered devices.<br>
<br>Payne's innovations, however, had advanced the boundaries of watercolour technique. His initial popularity and extensive teaching practice contributed greatly to the burgeoning interest in watercolour, both as a social accomplishment and as a serious field for collectors. He died in 1830 at his home, 49 Upper Baker Street, Marylebone, Middlesex, and was buried on 12 August at Marylebone parish church. Examples of his work are in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the City Museum and Art Gallery, Plymouth, the Royal Albert Memorial Museum and the West Country Studies Library in Exeter, and the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut.<br>
