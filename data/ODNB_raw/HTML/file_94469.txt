<span class="headword">Hillary, Sir  Roger</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1356), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was one of at least five sons of William Hillary and his wife, Agnes. The Hillarys, a well-propertied family holding lands in Lincolnshire, Warwickshire, Staffordshire, and Leicestershire, appear to have been related to the Bereford family of Coleshill, Warwickshire, whose members included Sir William Bereford, successively a puisne and chief justice in the court of common pleas from 1294 to 1326. For Roger Hillary, who is recorded as an attorney in that court from the summer of 1310, the connection is likely to have been a useful one. In 1324 he became a serjeant-at-law, and thereafter he is frequently mentioned as an advocate in the year-books, while by 1322 he was being named to oyer and terminer commissions, including politically sensitive ones investigating the rebellious activities of John Mowbray and Roger Clifford in 1322. But in the later years of Edward II's reign Hillary kept a relatively low profile, and apart from judicial commissions his only noteworthy activities were his acting, along with his brother Richard, as a parliamentary proctor for the prior of Coventry, and his being retained about 1326 by John Sutton of Dudley, one of the leading barons in the west midlands, for a yearly robe and 60<i>s</i>. fee.<br>
<br>Hillary's career began to prosper after the deposition of Edward II. Married to a woman named Katherine by the spring of 1320, he added to his estates in his home county of Staffordshire, acquiring the manor of Fisherwick, near Lichfield, in 1326&#150;7, and securing a life grant of the mill at Bentley, with its ponds and meadows, about the same time. Professionally a major advance came in 1329 with his appointment as chief justice of the common bench in Ireland, a position that he held for eight years. In fact Hillary's association with Ireland seems to have remained purely nominal, for the number and importance of his appointments to offices and commissions in England now began to increase dramatically. In 1332, for instance, he was named to a commission to deal with disturbers of the king's peace in Staffordshire, and in 1335 he was appointed to investigate the activities of the king's officers in the west midlands, while on 18 March 1337 he was made a justice of the English court of common pleas, having been knighted in the previous year. A number of his judgments are recorded in the year-books. They show him to have been capable both of a measured conservatism, as when he declared in 1342 that &#145;We will not and can not change the ancient usages&#146;  (Putnam, 106), and of a no less considered flexibility, when he ruled a year later in favour of extending the statute on executors of 1335 to cover detinue as well as debt, even though the statute spoke only of the latter. He also continued to receive important commissions away from Westminster: thus in August 1338 he was appointed to inquire in Herefordshire and Shropshire into the fate of the jewels, plate, and money of the second earl of Arundel, executed in 1326, while in 1340 he became involved in the levying of taxation, acting variously as an assessor, collector, and supervisor of the ninth on moveables in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire.<br>
<br>His obvious competence led to Hillary's being appointed chief justice of common pleas on 8 January 1341, replacing Sir John Stonor, who had been dismissed as part of the previous autumn's purge of the royal administration. On 9 May 1342, however, Stonor recovered his former position, while a few weeks later, on 4 June, Hillary once more became a puisne justice of the bench. He remained very active in that capacity, and it is a sign of his standing that in 1344 he was named to a special commission of councillors and high-ranking justices to discuss the terms demanded by the Commons in return for a grant of taxation. In the autumn of 1348 he was appointed a justice for an eyre in Kent which, however, never took place, while in March 1351 he was made a commissioner for the enforcement of the <span class="roman">Statute of Labourers</span> in Worcestershire. Two years later he became involved in the process whereby Roger Mortimer, the grandson of the earl of March executed in 1330, recovered his inheritance. Then early in 1354 Sir John Stonor retired and, on 20 February, Hillary was again appointed to succeed him as chief justice of the bench, and in that capacity took part shortly afterwards in the king's proceedings against the disgraced financier Sir William de la Pole. He remained chief justice for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Hillary was not only active in the service of the king, for he also became a valued servant of Edward, the Black Prince. He was listed as a member of the prince's council in 1347, occurs in the witness lists to the prince's charters, and was also appointed a justice for a forest eyre in north Wales. In September 1353 he was recorded as justice of Chester, an appointment controlled by the Black Prince, and he seems to have been a very active member of the latter's council well into the 1350s. His dependability in the prince's eyes is further shown by his being one of a number of the prince's servants who were appointed to try petitions, and thus to ensure that their master suffered no embarrassment from them, in the parliament of 1352.<br>
<br>His good and energetic services to the king and his heir brought Hillary a considerable amount of royal patronage. In 1336 Queen Philippa granted him the marriage of William, son and heir of William Plaunke, a landowner in several midland and southern counties, whom Hillary duly espoused to his own daughter Elizabeth. On 4 May 1344 he received a grant of free warren on all his demesnes in Staffordshire and Warwickshire, while in October that year he was given the marriage of Joan, sister and heir of John Bokeland, specifically &#145;for long and laborious service especially as chief justice of the Bench&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar of the fine rolls</span>, 22 vols., PRO, 1911&#150;62, 5.400). On 13 February 1345 he was licensed to crenellate his house at Bescot, near Walsall, which was presumably his principal residence. In October 1349 he inherited his own brother Richard's estate. Finally, in May 1354, for a payment of &pound;60, he was secured the marriage of John, son and heir of William Helyng. He also seems to have been moderately active in the land market, and had acquired the Staffordshire manor of Stretton-on-Fosse by 1344.<br>
<br>On 17 June 1351, perhaps in response to the black death, Hillary and his wife were granted a papal licence to choose their own confessors. But it was only on 1 June 1356 that Hillary died, whereupon his son Roger, who was also a lawyer, had seisin of his father's properties, which included a substantial estate in Staffordshire as well as smaller holdings in Leicestershire and Warwickshire. In his will Sir Roger left bequests totalling some &pound;330. Katherine Hillary, who in addition to her dower received &pound;100 worth of silver, died less than three weeks after her husband, on 20 June. Sir Roger had requested burial in the church of All Saints, Walsall, where his effigy showed him in full armour. It was recorded by the antiquary William Burton in 1613, but has since disappeared.<br>
