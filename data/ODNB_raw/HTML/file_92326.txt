<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chisholm, Sir  Samuel</span>, baronet  (1836&#150;1923), <span class="occ">local politician and temperance campaigner</span>, was born in Dalkeith, Midlothian, on 23 September 1836, the eldest son in the family of four sons and three daughters of John Chisholm (<i>c</i>.1810&#150;1882), a tobacco manufacturer, and his wife, Isabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilson (<i>c</i>.1810&#150;1888). He grew up in a highly politicized environment. The reform struggles of the 1820s and 1830s had galvanized local Liberalism, and his father became a dedicated supporter. The family's radicalism was further consolidated by membership of the United Secession church, which was characterized by its independent, evangelical outlook. Samuel Chisholm was baptized on 7 November 1836 by Joseph Brown, the minister of Dalkeith's largest Secession congregation, who openly embraced a range of progressive causes, including anti-slavery and temperance. For the rest of his life Brown was to exert a major influence on Chisholm, passing on his formidable public speaking skills and organizational energy.<br>
<br>Chisholm was educated locally, attending two elementary schools and, briefly, Dalkeith grammar school up to the age of eight. He then moved to a school run by the evangelical Free Church of Scotland. In 1850, at the age of fourteen, he began an apprenticeship with Mitchell Brothers, wholesale grocers and spirit merchants, headed by Alexander Mitchell, one of Dalkeith's most prominent Liberals and a co-religionist of John Chisholm. In 1847 the Secession church had become part of the United Presbyterian church, and both men were on the kirk session of the town's East United Presbyterian congregation, under Brown's spiritual direction. It was ironic that Samuel Chisholm commenced working life in a business that supplied alcohol, given that he claimed unswerving commitment to the temperance movement from the age of ten. In later years there was friction between Mitchell and Chisholm over the latter's forthright denunciation of the drinks trade, but during the 1850s Chisholm's employer played an important role in shaping his radical Liberal politics.<br>
<br>In 1861 Chisholm set up on his own as a wholesale grocer in Dalkeith, assisted by his youngest brother, Robert Fraser Chisholm (<i>c</i>.1847&#150;1892). He married, on 13 June 1866, Charlotte (<i>c</i>.1836&#150;1900), the Glasgow-born daughter of J. B. Thompson, a United Presbyterian minister. In 1863 Brown had departed for a new congregation, becoming minister of Kent Road Church in Glasgow. While Chisholm was aware that Glasgow presented promising opportunities to enhance his business interests, the call from Brown to be part of the Kent Road mission was a strong motivating impulse for him to move to the city in 1870. He immediately began a long involvement with the Glasgow Foundry Boys' Religious Society, serving as its president from 1890. He was also associated with various temperance organizations, notably the Scottish Temperance League, of which Brown was vice-president. For Chisholm temperance activism led to political activism. Glasgow's teetotal radicals saw drunkenness as the most corrosive factor in retarding the city's regeneration and aimed to return a corps of municipal representatives who would alter local licensing policy.<br>
<br>The Chisholm brothers had set up the firm of S. and R. Chisholm in 1870, but the partnership ended about 1881 and Samuel continued on his own as head of Samuel Chisholm &amp; Co. Determined to promote his political career, he eventually left the day-to-day running of the business to others. In the Glasgow corporation elections of 1888 he was returned unopposed as a town councillor for the eleventh ward, covering the Woodside district. He embraced housing as a campaigning issue and soon became closely identified with the affairs of the corporation's city improvement trust. Originating in 1866, the trust had the objective of clearing some of the worst slum areas and reconstructing much of the city centre. After a promising start progress had slowed down, and by the 1880s there was considerable public unease about the trust's ineffectiveness. Chisholm, who became the trust's convener in 1892, not only advocated the reactivation of the clearance programme but controversially argued that the corporation should build model dwellings to replace the slums.<br>
<br>Chisholm's plans for municipal housing, paid for by local taxation, antagonized middle-class ratepayers and private landlords. By directly linking slums, poverty, and anti-social behaviour with the availability of alcohol, he made bitter enemies in the drinks trade. His confident and sometimes abrasive style further infuriated his opponents, and he was castigated as a &#145;faddist&#146; who represented the worst excesses of radical Liberalism. In 1895 he attempted to enter parliament, standing for the working-class constituency of Glasgow Camlachie. The sitting Liberal Unionist retained the seat and Chisholm blamed the intervention of a Labour candidate, the miner Robert Smillie, for undermining his chances of success. After the Camlachie defeat he abandoned his ambitions of becoming an MP and concentrated on municipal politics.<br>
<br>In 1899 Chisholm was elected lord provost of Glasgow, the first Liberal incumbent of the post since 1880; ironically his election was ensured by the support of Labour councillors. His three-year term coincided with the South African War and he made strenuous efforts to distance himself from pro-Boer sentiments by becoming involved in fund-raising efforts for wounded combatants and bereaved families. He was prominent in events such as the 1901 Glasgow International Exhibition, which served as a showcase for the city's industrial and cultural achievements. He nevertheless remained a controversial figure. Glasgow at the turn of the century had Britain's largest municipal administration outside London, and public enterprises like water, gas, and tramways were conducted on the grand scale. Increasingly, civic interventionism was being criticized for skewing market forces and suppressing competition, and his housing strategy was exposed to criticisms of municipal empire-building. The Glasgow corporation was spotlighted in a series of articles in the London <span class="italic">Times</span>, where the civic leadership was depicted as transforming the city into &#145;a communistic society&#146;  (30 Sept 1902).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Times</span> had been briefed by the lord provost's Glasgow adversaries, who during the course of 1902 were becoming alarmed by the direction of Chisholm's policies. Plans to borrow &pound;750,000 to fund a new housing project had rallied landlords', builders', and ratepayers' groups against him. However, his most outraged opponents belonged to the drinks trade. New licensing regulations were in the course of being implemented in Glasgow, which, among other strictures, cut the hours of public house opening and banned the employment of barmaids. The trade viewed this as the start of prohibition by stealth and a major threat to their livelihoods. That Chisholm intended to seek a further term as lord provost, contrary to municipal convention, reinforced fears that worse would follow. By funding a candidate to stand against him, trade leaders played a key role in the concerted bid to unseat the lord provost at Woodside in the municipal elections of November 1902. The result caused a local sensation, as Chisholm was defeated in an acrimonious contest by 4093 votes to 1981. An immediate effect of his departure was that his housing proposals for Glasgow were not followed through and the initiative on the issue passed decisively to the Independent Labour Party.<br>
<br>Chisholm had aroused strong feelings because of his single-minded belief in the evils of alcohol. His reputation for being overbearing and humourless also did not help his cause. Yet Chisholm relished public debate and was a platform performer of considerable presence, whose style owed much to the dramatic tradition of temperance oratory. He was striking in appearance, with a flowing silver beard that added to the patriarchal image. He did not return to municipal politics after 1902, although he remained influential in local Liberal circles, where he was noted as a strong supporter of Scottish home rule. He also became active in various charitable and philanthropic organizations, particularly for promoting education.<br>
<br>On 7 November 1902 Chisholm was made a baronet, in recognition of public services. Following the death of his first wife, he married on 17 January 1903 Agnes Gibson (<i>c</i>.1848&#150;1921), daughter of Andrew Carnduff and widow of the Glasgow shipping magnate Thomas Henderson. The relationship was particularly happy, although Chisholm's enemies could not resist attacking him through his wealthy and glamorous wife, who they alleged had brought her well-stocked wine cellar when she moved to his home. In old age Chisholm developed a passion for motor cars. He died on 27 September 1923 at his home at 20 Belhaven Terrace, Glasgow, having contracted a bronchial infection while out motoring, and was buried on 1 October in Cathcart cemetery. He had no children, and the baronetcy became extinct.<br>
