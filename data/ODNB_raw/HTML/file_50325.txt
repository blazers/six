<span class="headword">Waltheof</span>, third earl of Lothian  (<em>d.</em> 1182), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50324/', "Gospatric, second earl of Lothian (d. 1166)")</script>, and his wife, Derder (Deirdre). His first appearance on the political scene took place within a year of the death of his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50322/', "Gospatric")</script>, probably at the battle of the Standard in 1138. Richard of Hexham recorded that among the Scottish hostages given to King Stephen to ensure the loyalty and good behaviour of David I was &#145;the son of earl Gospatrick&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Scottish Annals</span>, 214). This is generally taken to be a reference to Waltheof, who must have been only a youth at this time.<br>
<br>Under the year 1166, the chronicle of Melrose tersely records the death of Earl Gospatric and the succession of his son. The sequence of events surrounding Waltheof's succession is complicated by the possibility that he witnessed a charter of 1165 as earl, so that he may have received the earldom before his father's death. This would accord well with evidence that Gospatric had retired as a monk to Durham late in life. Whatever the case may have been, Waltheof inherited both the earldom of Lothian in Scotland and the lordship of Beanley in Northumbria, making him a third generation cross-border landholder. Despite this, little is known of his activities in Northumbria, although some evidence survives for litigation over his English lands.<br>
<br>Waltheof's involvement in one of the crucial episodes of the reign of King William the Lion illustrates both his primarily Scottish allegiance and his prominent position among the Scottish nobility. In 1173 William, angered by his failure to receive the earldom of Northumbria from Henry II of England, decided to make war on the English king. Jordan Fantosme describes how Waltheof and Duncan of Fife strove, unsuccessfully, to restrain the Scottish king from going to war. After William's ensuing capture at Alnwick in 1174, Waltheof acted as one of the hostages for the king under the terms of the treaty of Falaise of 1174. The hostages swore that if the king of Scots broke the agreement, they would side with the English king in order to force him to comply with the terms of the agreement. That Waltheof enjoyed a prominent place among the nobility of Scotland is attested not only by his role in the events of the 1170s, but also by his presence in the king's court when important disputes were settled, for instance that between Melrose Abbey and Richard de Moreville in 1180, and by his frequent attestations of King William's charters, suggesting that he was often in close attendance upon the king. This evidence makes it difficult to agree with those historians who argue that he preferred to remain aloof from political matters.<br>
<br>Unlike his father, Waltheof does not appear to have been a particularly active benefactor of the church. He did, however, confirm some of the grants made by his ancestors, as well as bestow several grants upon the abbeys of Kelso and Melrose. These included a gift of some neifs (serfs) to Kelso and a common pasture to Melrose. Waltheof married a woman named Alina, of whom nothing more is known except that she predeceased her husband, dying in 1179. Waltheof and Alina had two sons and one daughter: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50326/', "Patrick")</script>, who succeeded Waltheof as earl; Constantine; and Alice or Helen. On his death, in 1182, Waltheof was called by the chronicle of Melrose &#145;earl of Dunbar&#146;, while the same source referred to Alina as &#145;countess of Dunbar&#146; on her death  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 2.306, 301). These are the first occasions when the earldom was referred to as being of &#145;Dunbar&#146; rather than &#145;Lothian&#146;, but in both his charters and on his seal Waltheof always referred to himself simply as &#145;Earl Waltheof&#146;.<br>
