<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Knight,  (Ellis) Cornelia</span>  (1757&#150;1837), <span class="occ">author and courtier</span>, was the only child of Sir Joseph Knight (<i>d</i>. 1775), rear-admiral of the white, and his second wife, Phillipina Deane (1726&#150;1799). From the age of five she was educated for three days a week as a day pupil at the boarding-school kept by four Swiss sisters, the Misses Thomassets, in London. On the other three days of the week she was instructed in French, Latin, the elements of Greek, mathematics, geography, and history by a visiting master, M. Petitpierre, who had formerly been pastor at Neufch&acirc;tel; she was taught to dance by Mr Novere, a highly fashionable dancing-master. Her mother was a great friend of Frances Reynolds, the sister of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and Knight thus came to know Dr Johnson and his circle. When her mother failed to obtain a widow's pension after the death of Joseph Knight in 1775, mother and daughter were forced to move abroad in order to economize.<br>
<br>Initially intending to remain abroad for three years, Cornelia and Lady Knight travelled first to Paris and Toulouse, and then on to Rome, where they settled for eight years and mingled with the best society. Lady Knight was proud of her achievement in maintaining their social connections and propriety despite their frugal style of life and wrote in March 1793: &#145;I am sure few persons in the world have preserved independence upon so small a pittance, or are more clear of pecuniary obligations&#146;  (Ingamells, 581). During the late 1780s and early 1790s they toured northern Italy and France, and briefly visited Naples before returning again to Rome, where they remained from 1791 to 1798. Cornelia had acquired a reputation for her learning&#151;in May 1790 her mother wrote that she was busy learning Swedish, her tenth language&#151;and devoted much of her time to drawing and writing; she had amassed some 1800 drawings, &#145;some with the pen, but mostly coloured ones, the former from imagination, the latter from nature&#146;  (ibid., 582&#150;3), and in 1790 she published her first work, <span class="italic">Dinarbas: a Tale</span>. <span class="italic">Dinarbas</span> was a continuation of Samuel Johnson's moral adventure <span class="italic">Rasselas</span>, and is interesting principally as a record of Knight's views on education and conduct. She drew on her classical education for her next work, <span class="italic">Flaminius: a View of the Military, Social, and Political Life of the Romans</span> (1792); she announced in the preface that &#145;To bring history to life, is the chief intention of this publication&#146;  (p. vii). They spent the last year of Lady Knight's life in Naples and, during the Jacobin revolution there, in Palermo, in the company of Sir William and Emma Hamilton and Lord Nelson. Cornelia obtained the title of Nelson's poet laureate through her verses celebrating his victories, and dedicated her ode <span class="italic">The Battle of the Nile</span> to Sir William Hamilton &#145;as a tribute of gratitude from a daughter of the waves for the distinguished attentions confer'd on the British Navy&#146; by him and his wife. On her mother's death, on 20 July 1799, she complied with the latter's wishes and placed herself under the protection of Lady Hamilton.<br>
<br>On her return to England in November 1800 with the now notorious <i>m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois</i> of the Hamiltons and Nelson, Knight was advised by her friends that she was damaging her reputation by remaining in their company. She immediately left and severed her connections with her erstwhile patrons, much to their disgust. Emma gave vent to her feelings by writing in a copy of Moli&egrave;re she had been given by Knight: &#145;Altho she is clever and learned She is dirty illbred ungrateful bad mannered false and deceitful But my Heart takes a noble vengeance I forgive her&#146;  (Constantine, 254). Little is known of Knight in the years before she was appointed companion to Queen Charlotte in 1805, and thereafter her autobiography again falls silent until 1813, when she became companion to the queen's granddaughter Princess Charlotte. She incurred the queen's lasting enmity for abandoning her service, but she was desperate to escape the dull and monotonous court life at Windsor. Her new employment certainly proved a complete contrast, as she found herself entangled in the intrigues, quarrels, misunderstandings, and recriminations that were the daily staple of Charlotte's court, and she fell out disastrously with the princess's closest confidante, Mercer Elphinstone. The princess's refusal in July 1814 to marry her father's intended match for her, the prince of Orange, caused the prince regent to dismiss all her attendants, including Knight. Knight afterwards wrote revealingly about her influence on the young princess:<blockquote>either I ought to have remained with the queen, or I ought to have carried things with a higher hand to be really useful while I was with Princess Charlotte &hellip; I had the romantic desire that Princess Charlotte should think for herself, and think wisely. Was that to be expected from a girl of seventeen, and from one who had never had proper care taken of her since early childhood? (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 213)</blockquote>In spring 1817 Knight returned abroad. She thereafter spent most of her life on the continent, where her connection with the British court admitted her to the highest social circles and enabled her to collect the anecdotes that appear in her autobiography. In 1833 she published <span class="italic">Sir Guy de Lusignan</span>, a romance from the time of the crusades. Although she frequently revisited Britain, she died in Paris on 17 December 1837. An edited version of her autobiography, with selections from her diaries, was published in two volumes by Sir John William Kaye in 1861, with the help of James Hutton, and ran to three editions. Its popular success was dented by a stinging review in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, possibly influenced by her old enemy Mercer Elphinstone, who was still alive. The reviewer criticized Knight for constantly &#145;imputing, often by such quiet insinuation as is not readily detected, low or crooked motives to almost every person concerned in the Princess Charlotte's affairs&#146;, and went on to comment:<blockquote>It is therefore one of those books of scandal of which it is impossible not to regret the publication; such as so but cause unnecessary annoyance, if not to the living, to those who cherish the memories of their dead, while they add absolutely nothing to our knowledge of any fraction of history worth knowing. (<span class="italic">QR</span>, 140, Jan 1862)</blockquote>It is precisely because of her frank account of the chaos and unhappiness of Princess Charlotte's court that Knight's autobiography is valued today.<br>
