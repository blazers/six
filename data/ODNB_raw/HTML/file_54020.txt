<span class="headword">Hughes,  Goronwy <span class="st"> [Ronw]</span>  Moelwyn</span>  (1897&#150;1955), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born in Llwyn Onn, Cardigan, on 6 October 1897. Baptized Goronwy, he was always known as Ronw. A Welsh-speaker, he was the eldest of the six children of the Revd Dr John Gruffydd Moelwyn Hughes (1866&#150;1944), a former moderator of the Welsh Presbyterian church, and his wife, Anna Maria Lewis. After attending council schools in Cardigan, he entered University College Wales, Aberystwyth, where his studies were interrupted by the First World War. While serving with the West Yorkshire regiment he was wounded in 1916. He transferred to the Royal Flying Corps and served as a pilot (1917&#150;19). After the war he returned to Aberystwyth and graduated BA, before going on to Downing College, Cambridge, where he graduated LLB, obtained first-class honours in the law tripos, and won the chancellor's gold medal in English law. He joined the Inner Temple and was called to the bar in 1922.<br>
<br>Moelwyn Hughes practised on the northern circuit, where his reputation in transport and commercial law grew rapidly (he once successfully represented Billy Butlin in litigation over property which subsequently became the Pwllheli holiday camp). He also lectured in international law at the London School of Economics and in commercial law for the Law Society, and was an examiner for the Council of Legal Education and for London University. He wrote extensively, and edited the seventh edition of Lord Birkenhead's <span class="italic">International Law</span> (1928), as well as contributing the sections on agency, bills of exchange, money, and moneylending to the 1931&#150;5 edition of <span class="italic">Halsbury's Laws of England</span>. He also wrote jointly with Dingle Foot a standard work on rail and road traffic legislation. This ensured the continued demand for his services at hearings of various transport tribunals. On 11 May 1929 he married Louise Mary 
    (Lulu; 1902&#150;1973)
  , the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33547/', "(Frederick) Arthur Greer")</script>, lord justice of appeal. They had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Brought up in the Welsh radical tradition (he was active in the Fabian Society in his earlier days), Moelwyn Hughes unsuccessfully contested two general elections for the Liberal Party: at West Rhondda in 1929 and at Southport in 1931. He joined the Labour Party in November 1934 and stood unsuccessfully as its candidate for Cardiganshire in 1935. He was, however, elected unopposed at a by-election at Carmarthen in March 1941 and held the seat until his defeat by a Liberal at the general election in 1945. He made a modest contribution to parliamentary proceedings during those war years, inquiring, for example, about school funding under Rab Butler's <span class="roman">Education Act</span> 1944 and condemning excessive costs in undefended divorce proceedings. He returned to parliament for North Islington in 1950 but retired owing to ill health in the autumn of 1951. There had been speculation whether he might have become one of the law officers in 1950 (he had worked with Sir Hartley Shawcross on war crimes prosecutions) but events surrounding one of the public offices he held suggest that this would have been unlikely. During his first spell as an MP he was appointed king's counsel (1943) and during his second he was made a bencher of his inn (1950).<br>
<br>Outside parliament during the momentous years of the first Attlee government, Moelwyn Hughes was none the less extremely active in public affairs. He was chairman of the Greater London water inquiry (1947), special assistant commissioner for Wales under the Local Government Boundary Commission (1946&#150;9), and recorder of Bolton (1946&#150;53). The latter no doubt prompted his appointment as commissioner for inquiry into the Burnden Park, Bolton, football disaster in 1946, when thirty-three spectators were crushed to death by the sheer pressure of numbers in the stadium. In analysing the circumstances, which in many respects uncannily rehearsed the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, Moelwyn Hughes's report attributed the tragedy to the unanticipated size of the crowd (85,000 as against the expected 50,000), the admission of too many spectators to the fatal enclosure, unauthorized entries, and, perhaps crucially, the lack of machinery to ensure proper co-operation between police and club (since turnstile officials and keys were not readily available). Bolton Wanderers Football Club itself was not blamed but the club felt a great deal of remorse. Anticipating the post-Hillsborough disaster legislation, Moelwyn Hughes recommended that football grounds be made subject to safety licensing and that a centralized system at each ground be installed to count the number of spectators present. No legislation followed, merely an inadequate system of voluntary licensing for all grounds of at least 10,000 capacity.<br>
<br>As chairman of the cotton manufacturing commission from 1946 to 1949 Moelwyn Hughes was aware of the need to improve industrial productivity. To this end he suggested that where factories could demonstrate that redeployment had occurred, incentive payment schemes (which the official papers called the &#145;Moelwyn Hughes system&#146;) might be introduced. They would replace the industry-wide uniform price list legally enforceable by orders issued under the <span class="roman">Cotton Manufacturing Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act 1934</span> to prevent undercutting by employers. The scheme anticipated the later growth of plant-level bargaining.<br>
<br>From April 1946 to 31 January 1950 Moelwyn Hughes chaired the Catering Wages Commission. His resignation from that body dovetailed with his campaigning as Labour Party candidate for North Islington at the general election of February 1950. However, the timing hides the controversy which would undoubtedly have precipitated his resignation in any case. The sixth report of the commission, published in December 1949, had criticized what it considered to be inadequate government steps to support and encourage the dollar-earning potential of the British tourist industry, pointing to the absence of what later generations would call &#145;joined-up government&#146;. The report quoted from correspondence passing, among others, between the president of the Board of Trade, Harold Wilson, and the commission, and appeared to suggest that the government had ignored the commission's recommendations. A number of ministers, including Wilson and George Isaacs, the minister of labour, took exception to what they claimed was a breach of confidence in publishing the correspondence, and Isaacs wrote to Moelwyn Hughes condemning his alleged indiscretion. It was an accusation which hurt him deeply and, more importantly, which he vehemently rejected. One department, he insisted, was aware that the correspondence, drafted in formal style, would be published and none was marked private and confidential. On his resignation, the ministry press release announcing his departure gave no hint of the dispute. His replacement pro tem was Sir John Forster, president of the industrial court.<br>
<br>Moelwyn Hughes was also a member of the Rushcliffe committee on legal aid and advice, appointed in 1944, which unanimously recommended a publicly funded system of legal aid. The principle was eventually adopted in the <span class="roman">Legal Aid and Advice Act 1949</span>. Both the Society of Labour Lawyers and the Haldane Society of Socialist Lawyers, of which he had been a prominent member, presented to the inquiry evidence which did not fundamentally challenge the role of private legal practice, although they favoured wider lay involvement in the administration of the scheme than eventually obtained.<br>
<br>Moelwyn Hughes accepted a range of appointments in the public service, where his professional skills could be displayed and where he could bring forward fresh ideas; his useful and thoughtful analysis of the Bolton disaster of 1946 was again cited, many years after his death, in the unfortunate circumstances following the Hillsborough, Heysel, and Bradford City football disasters involving English fans in the 1980s. He died at 6 Heather Gardens, Golders Green, Middlesex, of heart failure, on 1 November 1955, and was cremated three days later at Golders Green crematorium.<br>
